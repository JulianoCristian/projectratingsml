The loan will meet part of BNDE's requirements for the financing of import component of specific industrial enterprises. The terms of the loan will be those normally applied to Bank loans to development finance companies  including the standard commitment fee. Unlike the fifth Loan Agreement with the Bank  there should be no specific limit on the use of Bank funds for public sector projects eligible for BNDE's financing under its policy statement. The proceeds of the loan should be used to finance direct imports  or the equivalent of 65 percent of off-the-shelf procurements  representing the import element of these costs. The free limit should remain $500 000  with an aggregate free limit corresponding to $6 million. The maximum amount of Bank funds to be used for a single investment project should be fixed at $3.5 million. The definition of BNDE's borrowing basis should be amended in order to exclude the part of provisions needed to cover realistically estimated loss possibilities  and BNDE should seek annually its auditor's opinion regarding the adequacy of this estimate. Under the proposed definition  BNDE's limit on term debt should be set at 6 times its borrowing basis. BNDE does not place the foreign exchange risk upon its borrowers. This book assesses the performance of family planning programs in developing countries  looking at their contributions and their costs. Attempts at identifying the attributes and approaches critical to effective programs are examined. This book draws on research to provide not a primer on running programs but a broad overview of what makes programs succeed. Focusing on family planning programs and their operation  it notes but does not elaborate on the contributions that other social development interventions make to an ongoing reproductive revolution  which is gradually transforming demographic prospects and individual lives. The reproductive revolution is evident in the transitions to lower fertility that are occurring in all developing regions: over two decades the average number of children per woman has fallen by a third. As fertility falls  so do infant  child and maternal mortality. Women spend decreasing proportions of their lifetimes giving birth and caring for young children. Despite progress  fertility is still high overall  and real reproductive choice is often an illusion. The developing countries produce most of the 90 million people added to world population every year -- the largest increases in human history. Maternal mortality in developing countries is ten times as high as in industrial countries  Not surprisingly  a quarter of married women express some unmet need for contraception.

Construction of a fertilizer plant at Thal  in the State of Maharashtra  with a daily capacity of about 2 700 tons of ammonia and about 4 500 tons of urea  including the provision of infrastructure  auxiliary  and offsite facilities required for the efficient maintenance and operation of the plant is proposed. Possible risks facing the Thal Fertilizer Project are in the form of technical problems  implementation delays and cost over-runs. These risks are minimized by the use of commercially proven technologies supplied by internationally recognized engineering firms and by the use of the services of the Fertilizer (Planning and Development) India Ltd. and RCF staff who are experienced in building and commissioning similar plants. Potential risks associated with the timely availability of required infrastructural facilities will be reduced by the Government of Maharashtra's confirmation that these would be provided and arrangements made for monitoring the execution of this work.
The project would be the first concerted effort to reduce air and water pollution in the Greater Sao Paulo area. It would provide financing for existing industries to carry out air pollution control subprojects to reduce particular matter emissions and water pollution control subprojects to pretreat or fully treat their liquid effluents. The project would primarily improve air quality in the Greater Sao Paulo area and reduce the discharge of toxic substances and organic materials into water bodies. The project also includes technical assistance to strengthen the technical and operational capability of the environmental protection agency of the state of Sao Paulo  which would be responsible for technical appraisal and supervision of subprojects. The project would contribute to improving the health and living conditions of the population  particularly of the urban poor. The main risk faced by the project relates to the negative internal financial rates of return of most pollution control investments. Opposition by industrialists to such investments could slow down project execution. The financial incentives included as part of the project and the penalties included in the legislation would reduce this risk to an acceptable level.

The project would form an important part of the Government's agricultural development strategy. It would help strengthen Argentina's export capacity and thus make it more independent from the stringent balance of payments constraints that have been a major factor of Argentina's erratic growth pattern in the past. Medium- and long-term agricultural credit and technical assistance financed under the project aim at increasing the relatively low productivity of farms in the Pampas and Mesopotamic region of the country  restoring the productive capacity of soils in an extensive area infested by weeks  and at expanding the country's cropping and pasture areas by clearing large portions of unproductive would have no special risks other than changes in Government pricing and exchange rate policies.

The proposed project would assist the Government in initiating its textile subsector development plan through a program of policy improvements  and technical and financial assistance. The credit line would be channeled through participating financial intermediaries to support investment and rehabilitation programs of textile enterprises for strengthening their productivity and competitiveness. It also seeks to enhance the ongoing efforts at strengthening appraisal and support capacities of financial intermediaries and technical assistance institutions by upgrading their textile expertise. The project faces moderate risks associated with possible slow utilization of the credit line and lower than expected returns from the enterprise-specific restructuring programs. Appropriate incentives have been introduced to maintain the interest of the participating financial institutions and as well as measures to strengthen the appraisal and support capacities of the financial and technical institutions serving the textile sector. A special incentive has been provided under the project to facilitate the use of expert services in preparation of economically and financially viable investment programs for the beneficiary textile enterprises.
The Housing Finance Project is designed to support the Government's housing policy by providing low-cost affordable serviced plots and increasing the low income segment of the urban population  and to encourage private and public developers to produce low income housing and develop the National Housing Institute (INH). Towards these objectives  the project would finance  through INH  the construction of infrastructure development and low cost housing schemes for the subsequent sale of housing units targeted at the selected income groups  provide mortgage loans through specialized institutions to eligible beneficiaries and strengthen INH through a technical assistance program.
A principal objective of the project is to strengthen the capacity of the Road Construction and Maintenance Department (RCMD)to execute its responsibilities for maintaining and upgrading the highway network in Afghanistan  including primary  secondary and tertiary roads. The principal components of the project would be: (i) a three-year time slice of a payment strengthening program; (ii) a three-year time slice of a road maintenance and improvement program; and (iii) technical assistance for RCMD. The recurrent costs of the maintenance and improvement program  amounting to $17.3 million  would be met in full by the Government. The project works would be carried out by RCMD  which needs an expanding capacity for executing work of the type envisaged. There are no domestic highway contractors  and  given the history of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for road contracts in Afghanistan  prospects for effective ICB for the proposed work are considered poor.
