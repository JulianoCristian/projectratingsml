There are three main project components plus support for project management. The first component provides the most essential information to emerging private farmers. The second component creates legally registered rural businesses with business plans. The third component provides finance to bankable rural clients. The first two components provide predominantly technical assistance, while the third component provides private investment support along with the necessary technical assistance to participating financial institutions. The first three components are closely linked, with each dependent on the others for successful outcomes."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"General finance
