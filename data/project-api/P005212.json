The project comprises the improvement and upgrading of four existing irrigation and drainage systems serving a total net irrigable area of about 90,600 ha and on an additional 16,400 ha.  The subprojects are Behbahan in Khuzestan province, Moghan in East Azerbaijan, Zarrieneh Roud in West Azerbaijan and Tajan in Mazanderan.  Existing main and secondary canals will be provided with concrete linings, and in some areas new canals will be added.  Main and secondary drains will be improved and expanded to cover all the subproject areas.  The tertiary systems will be developed selectively using canalletes, concrete-lined laterals, and open drains.  On-farm development will include selective subsurface drainage and land levelling with an emphasis on water management at the tertiary and farm levels.  The Agricultural Service Centers and research stations serving the project area will be reinforced through the upgrading of existing staff, the construction of facilities and the provision of additional staff, vehicles and specialized equipment. Provision will also be made for the import and sale of specialized farm machinery.  Special emphasis will be given to strengthening the operation and maintenance of all facilities from the main down to the tertiary system, to developing farmer participation through user groups, and to addressing critical environmental issues."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Iran!$!IR","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":59},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":24},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"157,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IR","sectorcode":"BC,AB,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,85,78,77","mjthemecode":"10,10,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":59},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":24},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20041216093519","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041216093519","DocDate":"11-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02011004033986","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02011004033986","DocDate":"11-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122571382","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122571382","DocURL":"31-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122571181","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122571181","DocURL":"31-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122571483","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122571483","DocURL":"31-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122571382","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122571382","DocDate":"31-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122571483","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122571483","DocDate":"31-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122571181","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122571181","DocDate":"31-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004013855","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004013855","DocDate":"19-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004013313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004013313","DocDate":"19-FEB-1993"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Iran"}},"facets":{}}
