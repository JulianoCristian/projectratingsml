The project's incremental output would generate annual revenues of about US$17 million of which about 72% would be in foreign exchange. Additional direct employment of about 600 would be generated after mill construction. Environmental conditions and worker safety would be enhanced by the provision of better dust and waste material collection facilities in the reconstructed and rehabilitated mills and factories. The main project risk would be possible delays in civil works construction. However, appropriate arrangements have been made to ensure that the project would be within the implementation capacity of the agencies concerned."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar!$!MM","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MM","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04577_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04577_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902365698","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902365698","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912514614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912514614","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar"}},"facets":{}}
