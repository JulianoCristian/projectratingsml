It will furthermore ensure the evacuation of power from these plants at least cost to the economy.  The project comprises the installation of about 910 km of 500-kV direct current (DC) power transmission lines between Rihand and Delhi, and the associated converting stations.  It also provides for approximately 1,450 km of 400-kV alternating current (AC) line connecting Singrauli-Rihand with the main load centers at Kanpur, Delhi, Panipat, and Jaipur and related substations in the Northern Region.  The project aims to introduce long-distance, high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) power transmission technology in India."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925220625","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925220625","DocDate":"29-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094720","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
