Sweden would thus participate with the equivalent of US$10.6 million and the Association would extend a credit of US$21.2 million equivalent. In broad terms, the joint-financing arrangement would cover expenditures under the project for three main purposes, namely: (a) investments in plant (buildings, furniture, equipment, vehicles) to complete and supplement the GOI pattern in project areas; (b) the nutrition component; and (c) incremental recurrent costs for the innovative parts of the project (the intensive rural component and the Population Centers).
