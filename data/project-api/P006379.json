The specific objectives are to : a) support the government in its efforts to transfer the Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos (CBTU) subdivision to the state of Sao Paulo; b) strengthen institutional, organizational and policy reforms; and c) contribute to poverty alleviation and environmental improvement.  The project includes an investment component (IC) and an institutional development (ID) component.  The IC component includes civil works and goods to implement the proposed rehabilitation of stations, track, rolling stock, signaling, power supply, telecommunications, traffic engineering equipment and construction of transfer points required to integrate CBTU with other modes.  The ID component consists of the development and implementation of policies and action programs to : 1) establish organizational, financial and institutional reforms; 2) operationalize multimodal and tariff integration between CBTU-SP, and Ferrovias Paulistas (FEPASA) feeder bus systems; 3) identify an investment program to consolidate the rehabilitation and decentralization; 4) study and recommend different management alternatives; and 5) provide technical and management training to CBTU employees."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"126,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,26,71,40,84","mjthemecode":"11,4,9,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99031910565450","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910565450","DocDate":"22-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122500826","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122500826","DocURL":"03-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122500826","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122500826","DocDate":"03-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122500124","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122500124","DocURL":"03-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122500425","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122500425","DocURL":"03-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122500124","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122500124","DocDate":"03-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122500425","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122500425","DocDate":"03-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001234355","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001234355","DocDate":"06-MAR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001234224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001234224","DocDate":"06-MAR-1992"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
