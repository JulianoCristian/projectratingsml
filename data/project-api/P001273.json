The free limit for a subproject would be raised from US$600,000 to US$800,000 (similar, in real terms,for the previous loans) and the aggregate free limit to US$7.0 million. Disbursements from the Bank's loan would be made against 100% of the foreign cost of direct imports, 65% of the invoice price of goods previously imported into Kenya and 40% of the cost of civil works. IDB would be charging an interest rate of no less than 12% on foreign funds (from 11%), and 13% on local funds (from 12%). Sub-borrowers will continue to bear the foreign exchange risk on foreign funds. The loan would carry an interest rate of 8.25% per annum and the amortization schedule would conform substantially to the aggregate of the amortization schedules of subloans and equity investments made by IDB, with a maximum maturity of 15 years, including a grace period of three years."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924225557","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924225557","DocDate":"31-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902344446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902344446","DocDate":"31-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96136_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96136_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e96135_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96135_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912470718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912470718","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
