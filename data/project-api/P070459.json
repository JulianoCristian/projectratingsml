The main components include: 1) construction of the Laoyemiao-Jining highway (LJH) - a divided four-lane, access controlled toll highway - which as part of the national highway network, and critical within the east-west corridor in the region, will connect the key industrial, administrative, and hub cities of Baotou, Hohhot, and Jining. Supply of equipment, electrical installation, lighting systems, and construction supervision will be financed, based on environmental criteria established prior to commencement of civil works; 2) a highway network improvement program for poverty areas, establishing that sections to be constructed should link the poor to the developed areas in the province, based on established monitoring and performance indicators; 3) highway safety program, as per detailed engineering designs, that include installation of traffic safety facilities; and, 4) institutional strengthening, and training, enhanced through technical assistance provision for project preparation, road maintenance programs, and engineering research."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
