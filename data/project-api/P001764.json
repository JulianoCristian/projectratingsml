To that end, the project consists of rehabilitation of the Electricity Company of Mozambique's (EDM) and National Petroleum Supply Company's (PETROMOC) facilities to meet current demands reliably; (ii) provision of operational support for three years and (iii) technical assistance to EMDM, PETROMOC, the Ministry of Industry and Energy (MIE) and the National Hydrocarbons Company (ENH).  The economic benefits from the project would be increased agroindustrial and industrial production through quick-acting relief on constraints on improving the reiliability of electricity and petroleum product supply to processing and manufacturing plants."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"PY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","code":"PY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20040928125258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040928125258","DocDate":"15-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019141524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019141524","DocDate":"28-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091817","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091817","DocDate":"31-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082229109_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082229109_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e368e5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e368e5_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e368e4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e368e4_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e368e2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e368e2_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e368e1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e368e1_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique"}},"facets":{}}
