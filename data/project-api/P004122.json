The project would also reduce the congestion in the city of Pusan by providing an on-dock storage area to replace storage areas in the city.  It would meet the Government objective of increasing the efficiency and reducing the costs of container handling and inland transportation.  It would also improve management and financial control by concerned institutions over port activities and strengthen port planning capabilities.  Specifically, the project would:  (a) increase capacity by construction of 1,704 meters of breakwater, a 3 berth container terminal with the required infrastructure and utilities and provision of the necessary container handling equipment.  It would also  (b) improve the rail capacity by providing equipment for rail cars; (c) provide training for port planners and technical assistance as well as (d) implement two Action Plans, one to address the rationalization of container handling and distribution in Korea and the other to strengthen the financial and managerial functions of the Korean Maritime and Port Administration and related institutions."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"141,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092716","DocDate":"31-MAY-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
