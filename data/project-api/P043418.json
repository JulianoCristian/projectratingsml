The project components involve financing mostly HIV/AIDS- and STD-related health promotion and disease prevention activities, with an emphasis on the Federal Capital and on the provinces of Buenos Aires, Cordoba, and Santa Fe, where 85 percent of HIV cases are concentrated. Specifically, the components involve: (1) mass and targeted communication campaigns, and primary and secondary educational materials, teacher training, and participatory projects on HIV/AIDS and STDS; (2) HIV/AIDS and STD prevention through Civil Society Organization-based or governmental behavior intervention subprojects for specific at-risk groups as well as for the general population, blood bank quality control, and HIV diagnosis and treatment in prenatal care; (3) diagnosis, treatment, and care of HIV infection and STDs, by establishing anonymous diagnostic and counseling centers, strengthening or developing laboratories, day care services, and home care services, and training physicians and other health care personnel; (4) monitoring, evaluation, and research, including strengthening the HIV/AIDS management information system, training in completing official forms and statistics, and in epidemiology and planning, reviewing financial and management arrangements, and undertaking research and development studies;
