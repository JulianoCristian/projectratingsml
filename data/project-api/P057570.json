The project has two major components: 1) the institutional development component will strengthen the capacity of the Urban Development and Housing Division (UDHD) and the project towns in urban planning development, land use management and mapping, and planning/implementation of urban development investments, focusing on adequate operation and maintenance, in addition to appropriate project management and monitoring of the UDHD, and the project towns. This component will further support the National Environmental Commission (NEC), in the development of environmental guidelines for the urban sector, and, the UDHD, for environmental codes of practice regarding solid waste management; and, 2) the urban development component will consist of water supply investments and chlorination equipment, confined to the rehabilitation, and increased capabilities of existing systems, as well as the construction of some new schemes. The solid waste management program will include a public information campaign, and, comprehensive programs of training for waste management personnel will be provided.
