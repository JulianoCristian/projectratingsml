Project components will include: (a) strengthening and expanding extension, training and research activities; (b) assisting with farm planning and the introduction of conservation measures; (c) improving and extending livestock dipping and slaughter facilities and programs; (d) providing marketing facilities and expanding credit activities; (e) providing potable water supplies; and (f) strengthening project management, monitoring and evaluation capacities. MOA will have overall responsibility for project implementation. About 10,500 farm families will benefit directly from the project. The project is subject to some risk from erosion and overcrowding, particularly in Dedza Hills. However, the project's emphasis on land husbandry/conservation, adaptive research and improved extension efforts should minimize the adverse effects of any such developments."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924182515","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924182515","DocDate":"28-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e058e4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e058e4_1_0","DocDate":"05-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902403257","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902403257","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912595368","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912595368","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
