Financing will be predominantly used by small and medium scale light industries, of a scale sufficient to support environmental pollution control technology, and linked to defined steps in enterprise reform in China--enterprise autonomy; ownership diversification, with participation of collectives and private and foreign-funded enterprises; introduction of the shareholding system; improvement of selected industries with advanced and new technology; development if marketing and distribution systems; and removal of social services from enterprises. The loan is expected to be disbursed over a five-year period. The complete portfolio will consist of about 50 subprojects with average subloans of $4.0 million."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
