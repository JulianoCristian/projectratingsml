The main programs fund individual research projects and equipment infrastructure projects open to universities and other research institutions, both public and private. The programs stress scientific merit rather than particular sectors of applications. (ii) A metrology component which will support the start-up of a new metrology center to provide primary metrology services to industry, and facilitate the development of a private system to provide secondary metrology services. (iii) A component of standardizing programs which will support building capacity for metrology's standards, testing, certification and quality assurance in industry. The Directorate General of Standards has prepared an indicative \"privatization\" program which would transfer the primary role for standards and quality assurance to the private sector. (iv) An intellectual property protection component which will support the start-up of an Institute for Industrial Property to implement the intellectual property law which was passed in July 1991."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":40},"theme4":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"189,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rule of law","Human development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48,66,36,27","mjthemecode":"2,3,8,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_9903040625442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903040625442","DocDate":"30-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122510846","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122510846","DocURL":"16-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122511047","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122511047","DocURL":"16-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122510745","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122510745","DocURL":"16-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122511148","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122511148","DocURL":"16-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122510745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122510745","DocDate":"16-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122510846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122510846","DocDate":"16-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122511047","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122511047","DocDate":"16-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122511148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122511148","DocDate":"16-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002224306","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002224306","DocDate":"30-APR-1992"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
