To achieve these objectives the project comprises several components. The first is a restoration of Old Habor (OH) unit 3 and OH unit 4 boiler. Second, the project calls for life extension of OH unit 4 generation turbine and upgrades for gas turbine units 3, 4 and 5. Transmission system reinforcements and ugrading of the energy control center and associated telecommunications facilities are also major concerns. Additionally, consulting services will be required for technical supervision and project management for the generating system components of the project; engineering and management for the environmental mitigation component of the project; and cost of service and tariff reform studies."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"21,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"JM","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,44,78,84","mjthemecode":"11,10,4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200212179","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200212179","DocURL":"03-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200212179","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200212179","DocDate":"03-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200212380","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200212380","DocDate":"03-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200212481","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200212481","DocURL":"03-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200212481","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200212481","DocDate":"03-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200212380","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200212380","DocURL":"03-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb5f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb5f_1_0","DocDate":"28-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb5d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb5d_1_0","DocDate":"28-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019113856","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019113856","DocDate":"01-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092023","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092023","DocDate":"31-DEC-1994"}],"countryname":"Jamaica"}},"facets":{}}
