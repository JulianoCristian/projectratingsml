The project will provide immediate, quick-disbursing support to finance a positive list of imports needed for the recovery effort while supporting macroeconomic objectives. Also, the project will provide assistance for a broad range of imports by the private sector, especially imported production inputs and imported capital equipment. No disbursements will be made to cover used or luxury goods, military equipment, or nuclear reactors. The main benefit of the project is to provide financing for necessary imports despite a sharp drop in exports and a decline in private capital inflows and to allow for necessary budgetary expenditures related to refugees not covered by humanitarian relief agencies and related to the sharp economic downturn induced by the crisis. The major project risks are that the Kosovo conflict may continue, imposing ongoing debilitating effects on the region and requiring additional interventions by the international donor community."},"country_namecode":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of!$!MK","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MK","sectorcode":"YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Economic management","Economic management"],"themecode":"23,21,58","mjthemecode":"7,1,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01062804081863","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01062804081863","DocDate":"04-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022515341264","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022515341264","DocDate":"24-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_99051205342676","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99051205342676","DocDate":"30-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9904300532296","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9904300532296","DocDate":"09-APR-1999"}],"countryname":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of"}},"facets":{}}
