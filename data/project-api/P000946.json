There are five project components.  First, high forest resource management will establish forest resource management policy and legal framework; design and test integrated forest reserve management systems and mechanism to encourage private sector involvement in both on-  and off-reserve settings.  Second, Savanna resource management will develop new multidisciplinary institutional arrangements for drylands management; and pilot test and implement improved systems for community-based management of savanna woodland and other resources.  Third, wildlife resource management will retrain personnel in the Wildlife Department; and prepare and implement park and reserve management plans.  Fourth, environmental management coordination will support district level environmental management planning and monitoring capacity; and improve information flow among sectoral agencies.  Fifth, biodiversity conservation will develop and implement integrated reserve management plans."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":46},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":38},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"9,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"BH,BC,JB,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB,PPP","themecode":"80,76,82,25,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs,Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"7,2,11,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB,PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":46},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":38},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20080731031317","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080731031317","DocDate":"24-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080703005909","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080703005909","DocDate":"20-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040203105957","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040203105957","DocDate":"16-JAN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022415155932","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022415155932","DocDate":"02-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061012283333","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061012283333","DocDate":"02-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980625102452","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980625102452","DocDate":"15-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980313101955","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980313101955","DocDate":"21-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173042","DocDate":"15-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs,Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
