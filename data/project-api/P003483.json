The regional and provincial project components are: (i) health planning, management and reform; (ii) disease prevention and surveillance; (iii) health education; (iv) maternal and child health services; (v) emergency services; (vi) hospital services; (vii) rehabilitative medical services; (viii) medical education and training; and (ix) equipment management. Medical education, health education, and emergency service investments at the provincial level will receive additional support beyond that needed to just support the project region. A national component to strengthen the capability of the Ministry of Public Health to guide, assess and replicate the project and to begin to deal with issues which transcend the provincial and local levels is also being supported by the project."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
