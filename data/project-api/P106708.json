In the near term, economic activity is likely to reverse its decline and the Bank's base scenario for Colombia includes gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 0.4 percent in 2009 and a modest rebound of economic activity in 2010. Despite the impact of global conditions, Colombia is in a better position to confront the global crisis than other Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) countries, as a result of its countercyclical monetary policy and fiscal stimulus over 2009. While there remains uncertainty as regards to the depth and length of the global recession, neither external nor fiscal sustainability appear at risk. The operation proposes to consolidate past gains and support the reform agenda in areas that need strengthening and consolidation. The development objective of the operation is to strengthen an inclusive, equitable and efficient social protection system by: (1) promoting greater integration, efficiency and equity of social insurance, (2) improving the targeting, efficiency, and articulation of social assistance programs, and (3) promoting higher quality training and employment services. To achieve this objective, the operation supports policies in a broad range of areas, in particular: 1) efforts to increase the coverage of inclusive systems serving the entire population such as the national training and labor intermediation system or health insurance; 2) efforts to build an equitable system that serves the poor and vulnerable through improved targeting and coordination of social assistance and greater efforts to reach the poorest; 3) and efforts to increase the efficiency of social protection through improved information systems, ration"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":50},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":10},"totalcommamt":"500,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"JA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"55,54,51,67","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,6,6,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":80},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20110808234629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110808234629","DocDate":"29-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010122801510670","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010122801510670","DocDate":"28-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100128011428","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100128011428","DocDate":"11-JAN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000362238_20091204143208","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000362238_20091204143208","DocDate":"30-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20091119092110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20091119092110","DocDate":"26-OCT-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
