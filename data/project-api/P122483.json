This program document proposes a fifth PRSC for the Republic of Mali in the amount of SDR 44.5 million (US$70 million equivalent). This operation is the third in a programmatic series of three PRSCs designed to support the implementation of the Government's poverty reduction strategy. Specifically, this second series aims to strengthen public financial management and improve access to basic social services, while enhancing the regulatory and institutional framework for infrastructure and private investment. The reform program supported by this operation continues and deepens the agenda introduced by third PRSC and fourth PRSC, with an increased focus on improving the environment for private investment and infrastructure. The design of the second PRSC series benefited from consultations with various stakeholders. The lessons learned from the implementation of the first four PRSCs were taken into account in the design of this follow-up operation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Mali \u2013 Cinqui\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>L\u2019objectif global de la deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie du programme de cr\u00e9dits d\u2019appui pour la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 est de soutenir la mise en \u0153uvre du Cadre strat\u00e9gique de croissance et de r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 du Mali adopt\u00e9 en 2006.
