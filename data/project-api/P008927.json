TSKB's new drive to escalate its lending and technical assistance to export-oriented projects will have a major direct impact on the Government's efforts to increase such investments in Turkey. The risk that Government policies may not maintain sufficient incentive to achieve this objective, is being addressed by inter alia financing of exporters' imported requirements and a dialogue on export policy under the Bank's Program Loan."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e95870_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95870_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUL-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e9586f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9586f_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUL-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902332989","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902332989","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
