There are four main project components. The first finances services from management advisors and privatization advisors, needed to privatize a savings bank, and funds a financial audit.

The third component supports advisory services to develop and implement a privatization strategy; to price and set reserves for third party liability and casualty/life insurance products; and to introduce modern claims management systems and skills. It also develops and integrates accounting and operations' information systems, and develops the legal and regulatory environment dealing with issues such as solvency and liability/asset management.
