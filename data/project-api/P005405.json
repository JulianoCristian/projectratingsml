The project will finance the rehabilitation of three traditional irrigation perimeters covering some 12,500 ha and the development of two new perimeters with a total irrigated surface of about 5,300 ha. The project will also support complementary infrastructure such as road construction, power supply and on-farm development. The investments will be complemented by the introduction of a legal framework ensuring that beneficiary farmers assume responsibility for operation and maintenance of irrigation networks as well as for reimbursing the Government for investment costs to a degree commensurate with their earning capacity. The project will also provide an opportunity for the regional offices of the Ministry of Agriculture to build up experience in planning, implementing and monitoring the development of the subsector."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"42,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019124029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019124029","DocDate":"26-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902412861","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902412861","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9746d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9746d_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901004970","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901004970","DocDate":"28-FEB-1983"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
