The project consists of the following components: (a) Improving the effectiveness of the delivery of priority health interventions at district and community levels. (b) Phase II will build on the analytical work done on human resources in the first phase. The program will support innovative approaches required to address the severe constraints in human resources, such as continuing education opportunities for contracted medical officers and nurses and career advancement opportunities. (c) The program will support the further development and implementation of a national health sector financing policy. The health financing policy will address the role of the public sector, efficiency in mobilization and allocation of public financing and strategies for ensuring sustainable financing. (d) The construction of the new referral hospital will be tied to the necessary reforms in hospital administration and management under the public-private partnership arrangement. (e) Phase II will support the implementation of a medical waste management plan in the health sector."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of
