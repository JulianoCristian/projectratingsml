The changes are: a) revision of the project development objective to take account of the revised priorities in the education sector; b) revision of component three to be aligned with the revised objective and including the activities to be financed under the additional financing; c) revision of component one to include the maintenance costs of the lower secondary schools (colleges); d) revision of cost estimates per component; e) revision of the implementation arrangement in alignment with those from the EFA Fast Track Initiative (FTI) Catalytic Fund (CF); and f) reallocation of grant proceeds. The restructuring will ensure the positive impact of new investments in the sector, including the US$40 million grant from the EFA FTI CF. The overall results framework will be clarified and revised for both the credit and the additional financing."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
