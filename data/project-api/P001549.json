The project would consist of a package of policy and institutional reforms, supported by two components, one for institution building and one for production development.  The main policy reforms are :i) encouragement of farmers associations to take over responsibilities such as feed mixing and distribution, fodder seed multiplication, cattle breed improvement and milk collection; and ii) the incentive framework should allow market-based competition, requiring that suitable pricing mechanisms be established for dairy products imported under food aid or subsidized surpluses.  The institution strengthening component would promote private veterinary practice and review and reform formal training in livestock and veterinary science.  The production development component would include support to cattle production systems, mainly through improved disease control; dairy development in the central highlands by strengthening dairy producers associations and improving milk collection."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":32},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"19,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MG","sectorcode":"BC,AJ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,78,40,75","mjthemecode":"10,4,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":68},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":32}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99122305513820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99122305513820","DocDate":"03-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121020813","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121020813","DocDate":"12-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121020612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121020612","DocDate":"12-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121020612","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121020612","DocURL":"12-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e38bc2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e38bc2_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960930205812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930205812","DocDate":"22-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100820052520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100820052520","DocDate":"18-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930205432","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930205432","DocDate":"18-APR-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Madagascar"}},"facets":{}}
