The project will help make training and employment services more relevant to the needs of individuals and enterprises and will assist the government in its strategy to increase labor productivity and mobility. The project will also assist the government in implementing its vocational training reform by: 1) developing its capacity to monitor the labor market and to use economic analysis to identify and evaluate alternative training investment opportunities; 2) gradually replacing the existing institution-based training by enterprise-based, dual training and apprenticeship programs; 3) promoting in-service training for small and medium enterprises and improving the vocational training tax-rebate system; and 4) enhancing labor mobility by developing employment services for workers affected by economic restructuring. The project will consist of the following three components: 1) creation of a labor market information system; 2) development of employment services, including consulting services, equipment and staff training; and 3) development of training services comprising technical assistance, civil works, in-service training, vehicles and equipment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"BC,YZ,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"66,41,51,65","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,6,4,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":60},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":34},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040106144720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040106144720","DocDate":"23-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123113550","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123113550","DocURL":"02-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214132312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214132312","DocDate":"14-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062215012429","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062215012429","DocDate":"25-MAY-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
