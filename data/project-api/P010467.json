Specifically objectives are as follows: 1) improve muncipal solid waste management and services in the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) and participating local authorities; 2) reduce wastewater pollution in the Beira Lake catchment area and selected industrial zones; 3) develop the capabilities of local governments and institutions to plan and manage municipal services in a sustainable, environmentally beneficial manner; and 4) assist in mobilizing private participation in the development and operation of urban infrastructure services. The project comprises four major components. The first is a municipal solid waste management component which will support the construction of a sanitary landfill, construction of a 100 tons/day capacity compost plant the Welisara landfill, provision of potable water supply and other infrastructure for the communtiy residing adjacent to the landfill site and the purchase of equipment and vehicles for safe collection, transport and final disposal of hospital wastes at the Welisara landfill. The second component supports a wastewater collection system for construction of a sewer network in each of the two industrialized zones, Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela, to collect and carry industrial and domestic wastewaters to two separate wastewater treatment plants built by the private sector. The third component supports a pollution control program in the Beira Lake catchment for the interception of unauthorized wastewater outlets now discharging to the storm drainage system and connecting them to existing sewerage system and reduction of sewerage overflows through cleaning sewer lines, rehabilitating pumping station, and adding a sewer line along "},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Solid waste management","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"39,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Solid waste management"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"BH,WB,WA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development"],"themecode":"73,84,44","mjthemecode":"4,11,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Solid waste management","code":"WB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":50},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20030714174447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030714174447","DocDate":"13-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02032604023241","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02032604023241","DocDate":"31-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123364800","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123364800","DocURL":"24-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123364800","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123364800","DocDate":"24-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23efe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23efe_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008011847","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008011847","DocDate":"02-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970716150149","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716150149","DocDate":"30-APR-1994"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
