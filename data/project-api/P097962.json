The percentage of expenditure to be financed from the project will be amended to 100 percent from November 30, 2012 up to the Project closing date of December 31, 2012. The total Grant allocation of US$25.5 million and the full Government contribution of US$20.4 million have been transferred to the Project account and fully committed. However, as of November 31, 2012, there are unexpended balances of US$1,499,197.38 from the Grant and US$1,175,587.00 from the Government. While the percentage of expenditure to be financed by Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) has been increased for all MDTF supported projects to an average of 75 percent, the only exception was ERP, which has been financed by only 56 percent. This percentage will be further reduced, as it is unlikely for the full amount of the outstanding unspent balance from MDTF to be used by December 31, 2012. This is mainly due to the delay in the execution of one of the two contracts for the delivery of furniture to 27 of the 52 schools built under the Project. Deliveries to all of these schools might not be completed within the closing date due to capacity of the supplier and the logistical challenges caused by the poor road network. Payments may subsequently not be made from the grant funds. The amendment is therefore necessary to increase the percentage of expenditure to be financed out of grant funds from the current 56 percentage to 100 percent for the period November 30 to December 31, 2012 to allow for full disbursement of the grant funds and to allow for the Gov"},"country_namecode":"Republic of South Sudan!$!SS","sector1":{"Name":"General education
