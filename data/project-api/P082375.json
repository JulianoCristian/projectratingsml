The extension is necessary to: (i) help the local governments finalize the preparation of forest and pasture management plans and implement the investments to improve forest and pasture lands; and (ii) assist the Government to implement the institutional forestry reform in central, regional and local level through staff training, institutional and legal advice. The Borrower has a written action plan to complete the implementation of the project during the extension. Disbursement of project funds until August 31, 2010 reached US$ 13,444,193 while another US$ 4,000,000 has already been committed, out of the total donor financing of US$ 17,200,000.
