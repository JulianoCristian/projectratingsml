The additional open and covered storage space is needed to solve present and expected storage problems; (ii) in Lae, a deep-water berth designed to accommodate container traffic would be constructed as an extension of an existing wharf. As a result of the construction of the Lae-Highlands Highway, traffic through the port has been increasing at an average of 17 percent annually for the last three years and a three-shift operation has been introduced to decrease ship delays. As previously explained, expansion in excess of the proposed works depends on construction of a road from Madang to the Highlands; (iii) coaster berth of facilitation will be added at the port of Kieta, to free the existing deep-water berth for overseas shipping and avoid current delays; (iv) the existing port at Samarai is old and unsafe for heavier loads, causing overseas lines to bypass the port. A small new port at Alotau, to cost US$1.3 million, will serve the Milne Bay District better; (v) the association would also finance cargo-handling equipment and would provide for training and management consultant services as well as the cost of engineering consultants."},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine!$!PG","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"PG","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912501253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912501253","DocDate":"20-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903315272","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903315272","DocDate":"30-APR-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190218397","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190218397","DocDate":"30-APR-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081de30d9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de30d9_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de30d0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de30d0_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b0d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b0d_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1972"}],"countryname":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine"}},"facets":{}}
