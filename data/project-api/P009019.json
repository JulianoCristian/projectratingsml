The hydro plant would consist of the construction of a double curvature thin arch dam with a height of 201m, an energy tunnel of 2.05km length and an inside diameter of 9.30m, and an underground power plant.  The reservoir active volume is 300 million m.  When complete, the complex will provide 1,600 GWh p.a. of electric energy.  The transmission component consists of construction of 737 km 154 kV transmission lines and 12 substations with installed transformer capacity of 1,350 MVA and a modern load dispatch center."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"270,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,44,39,71","mjthemecode":"9,4,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3961214140204","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214140204","DocDate":"24-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200085389","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200085389","DocURL":"12-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200085288","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200085288","DocURL":"12-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200085288","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200085288","DocDate":"12-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200085187","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200085187","DocDate":"12-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200085389","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200085389","DocDate":"12-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002121728","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002121728","DocDate":"05-MAY-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
