The project became effective January 25, 1999. It was formally restructured, with approval by the Board in 2002. Since the restructuring the project has been implementing activities in accordance with the restructuring plan; the project is focused on the project description as delineated at the time of the restructuring. The Project Development Objectives (PDO) and related targets remain unchanged. The project scope, activities and projected outcomes have not changed. In recent years, the project has been implementing at a good pace, making good progress towards reaching its targets, and PDO.
