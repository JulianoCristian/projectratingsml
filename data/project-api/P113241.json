PRSG-6 is the third operation in the second series of PRSGs (beginning with PRSG-4). It forms an integral part of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), approved by the Board of Executive Directors on September 26, 2008 in support of the Government's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). The EDPRS covers the period 2008-2012 and takes stock of a decade of achievements in rehabilitation and reconstruction. It presents a strategy focused on accelerating growth and human development, with an emphasis on decentralization, and a greater role for the private sector. The EDPRS priorities are articulated through three flagship programs aimed at promoting sustainable growth and poverty reduction and improving governance. The main risks to the program are: (i) continued instability in the great lakes sub-region and the effects on economic stability and donor support; (ii) government capacity to implement the EDPRS; and (iii) continued global economic slowdown. The downside risk to Rwanda's economic growth should the global slowdown persist will arise from a likely increase in the external account deficit from a reduction in export earnings. The Bank is monitoring the situation and providing additional finance of $29.8 million through the crisis response window. Government will continue its policy of identifying areas for contingent spending as more external resources become available. Government will continue to protect priority spending from reductions in overall spending, expand the tax base and improve the efficiency of the tax system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":31},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":15},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":32},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":15},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":15},"totalcommamt":"115,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Crops"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Aide Memoire,Financing Agreement,Program Document","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"AH,EZ,TZ,BZ,WZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Urban development","Human development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"27,66,71,25,39","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,9,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":31},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":31},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20130301100508","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130301100508","DocDate":"28-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011031619085081","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011031619085081","DocDate":"16-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Aide Memoire (AM),  Vol.1","DocType":"AM","EntityID":"090224b08171de44_2_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08171de44_2_0","DocDate":"26-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010051812041480","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010051812041480","DocDate":"16-APR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20100309225903","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100309225903","DocDate":"03-MAR-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
