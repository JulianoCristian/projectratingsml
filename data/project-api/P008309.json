It is designed to improve access of the private sector to medium- and long-term credit for investments in primary agriculture and agribusiness. Medium- and long-term foreign exchange resources will be made available through World Bank approved commercial banks to finance imports of farm machinery and other equipment needed in the modernization of the sector. The project will be implemented over a four-year period and will consist of two major components: 1) the credit component will finance medium- and long-term sub-loans exclusively to private investors for eligible investments. These will be imports of fixed and movable assets and associated permanent working capital for financially and economically viable investments in agriculture, agribusiness and related activities such as transport, trade, handicrafts, rural tourism, and associated services; 2) the institutional development assistance to the participating financial intermediaries will include: a) technical assistance to strengthen their capacity in the appraisal and supervision of sub-loans, and b) the financing of part of the office and other equipment needed for modernization."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":47},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":47},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BG","sectorcode":"BC,YB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"41","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":47},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":47},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200150631","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200150631","DocURL":"21-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006000928","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006000928","DocDate":"23-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006000638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006000638","DocDate":"23-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Bulgaria","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
