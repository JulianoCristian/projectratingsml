The project will support:  (i) a new curricular approach and extended school day for the first two years of primary school through in-service teacher training, provision of new educational materials, more efficient school feeding programs, and school construction to allow primary schools in poor neighborhoods to operate two daytime five-hour shifts; (ii) expansion of low cost pre-primary education provided by private non-profit organizations and municipalities in poor neighborhoods; (iii) reform of the school health program to emphasize cost-effective screening, referral, and health education;
