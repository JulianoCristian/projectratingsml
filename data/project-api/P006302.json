It will also improve the provision of water supply to 5.3 million people who now receive a deficient service in the same states. The project will include construction of water production, treatment, storage and distribution facilities and about 125,000 house connections in the capital cities of the three states; execution of metering, leak detection and control programs in capital cities and major towns; construction of sewage collection and disposal facilities in capital cities and major urban centers; and expansion and improvement of water supply systems in 35 medium-sized cities and 285 small villages, most of them in rural areas. The project will also include tariff studies and consultancy services for the three state water companies which will be the executing agencies. It is estimated that 61 percent of the final beneficiaries of water supply investments in the capital cities will belong to families having incomes below the relative poverty level. In rural areas this proportion will be higher."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924210247","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924210247","DocDate":"23-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902321126","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902321126","DocDate":"31-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912413280","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912413280","DocDate":"31-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e41a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e41a_1_0","DocDate":"30-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e419_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e419_1_0","DocDate":"30-JAN-1979"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
