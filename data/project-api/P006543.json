The project will support improvements in: a) system - wide management through student assessment, educational monitoring, and operational studies to foster information-based decision making; b) school administration through systematic school planning (including school development grants), school leadership development, and provision of office technology systems; c) teaching competence through increased access of public school teachers to training in classroom management, enhancement of curriculum development, and evaluation of classroom interventions; d) availability of learning materials through regular provision of books and other learning aids to all students in public classrooms; and e) facility management in support of classroom construction and rational school space utilization necessary to ensure that all pupils attending state schools have access to the locally-standard four and a half hours of schooling per day. To achieve these objectives, the project will finance educational materials, school equipment and furniture, vehicles, civil works, technical assistance (including training), and operational expenses. The project will also finance project management costs of about US $4.4 million equivalent.
