The loans support an ongoing and broad program of reforms in the urban transport sector in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago. The loans are supported by a companion technical assistance loan (Report No: 28521-CL) to help facilitate the achievement of reforms targeted for second tranche release and to provide technical follow-up, monitoring, and strengthening of the implementation of the Santiago Urban Transport Reform. The main development objectives of the SECALS are to improve the level of transport services to the residents (particularly low income residents) and businesses, reduce resource costs, and increase environmental quality. The specific objectives (i) Reduce transport costs in their financial, travel time, and environmental dimensions, and increase transport efficiency; (ii) Improve the coordination o f public sector activities in land use, transport planning, infrastructure investment, traffic management, and bus franchising; (iii) address urban poverty through improving access to jobs and economic opportunities; and (iv) enhance social inclusion through improved access to schools, health facilities, and wider social interaction. Benefits include (i) efficiency improvements that contribute to the city economy and hence economic growth; (ii) resource savings from transferring the bus flows in major corridors to an exclusive space, the reduction of bus vehicle-km on the street system, the rationalization of the route network, and the reduction of revenue risks from operators; (iii) environmental improvements (higher air qual"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"Urban Transport","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"30,160,000","sector":[{"Name":"Urban Transport"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Document,Environmental Assessment,Program Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"TC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,89,84","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Urban Transport","code":"TC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090821002500","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090821002500","DocDate":"11-AUG-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2006012611500074","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006012611500074","DocDate":"19-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2006012611500074","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006012611500074","DocURL":"19-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050705083417","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050705083417","DocDate":"11-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20040511094149","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040511094149","DocDate":"28-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000012009_20040330135417","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040330135417","DocDate":"01-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20040212110824","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040212110824","DocDate":"12-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000160016_20040323085211","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040323085211","DocDate":"16-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000012009_20040330135813","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040330135813","DocDate":"26-DEC-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
