The project will increase the use of containers in the transport of general cargo, and encourage and facilitate the use of the railway for such transport wherever it is economically the best option. The project will: a) improve the institutional framework for efficient and competitive container transport through the removal of the main customs practices and procedures restricting the inland movement of containers; b) strengthen the commercial approach and operational efficiency of the Container Corporation of India (CONCOR) by diluting at least a 5 percent share of the Government's equity in CONCOR, broadening the composition of the Board of Directors, reforming the claim policy to customer needs, and providing technical assistance and training; and c) support scheduled high-quality container train services in the main corridors through the acquisition of selected rolling stock, cargo handling equipment, transponders and readers for electronic tracking of container trains, flat car and containers, and related civil works and engineering services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"94,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BC,TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"44,39,40,43","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02070404010084","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02070404010084","DocDate":"12-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200144115","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200144115","DocURL":"29-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200144216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200144216","DocDate":"29-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200144115","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200144115","DocDate":"29-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200144216","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200144216","DocURL":"29-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99e26_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99e26_1_0","DocDate":"09-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e99e25_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99e25_1_0","DocDate":"09-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006115721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006115721","DocDate":"18-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005230927","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005230927","DocDate":"09-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of India","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
