All of these roads already carry traffic, but they are unimproved and many sections are impassable in the rainy season. The project roads, to be selected from an agreed list of roads, are required to have economic rates of return of not less than 12 percent based on bid prices. Roads totalling about 400 km, almost all located in the Northeast, have already been selected for the first year's construction program. The project also includes provision of laboratory and traffic counting equipment for the Department of Highways (DOH), studies and engineering of provincial and rural roads and other transport studies for the preparation of future projects, technical assistance to DOH and the Transport Planning Unit of MOC, and training of DOH staff."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191251391","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191251391","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902380447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902380447","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
