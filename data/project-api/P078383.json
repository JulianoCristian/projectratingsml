There are four components to the project. (1) Local economic development in the mining areas. This component would support the empowerment of local communities and municipalities for the development of alternative economic activities and increased efficiency in the delivery of social services. (2) Geo-information and development. This component would provide the geoscientific information necessary to enhance the economic development of Mauritania. Geo-data are fundamental for good governance and proper land use management, and would support many sectors, such as water resources and environmental management, promotion of investments in the mining sector and others. (3) Capacity building of public mining institutions. This component would strengthen the mining sector management capacity by establishing a Mining Sector Promotion Unit (UPM) and reinforcing Mining and Geology Directorate (DMG), and the Mining Cadastre created under the first project. The sector monitoring and control capacity of Mining and Geology Directorate (DMM) would be reinforced. (4) Project management will build upon the existing Mining Project Coordination Unit (UCPM). Current operations will be reinforced by an assistant accountant and a project evaluation specialist. UCPM will link with all concerned parties/entities and will carry out financial management, procurement and disbursement activities."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of
