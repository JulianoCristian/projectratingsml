There are three components. The first, the Science and Technology Research component, improves the quantity, quality, and relevance of research and human capital formation through field development to stimulate research in new and lagging fields with scientific, economic, and/or social importance; research projects to promote research quality, consolidate and improve peer review, and participatory planning; and institutional strengthening of the deputy directorate of scientific research of CONACYT (National Science & Technology Council). The second component, the Industry-University Linkage component, supports joint action between universities/public research institutes, and the private sector by restructuring public science and technology institutes, providing matching grants for joint industry-academia projects, and funding technical assistance to universities to create and strengthen outreach. The third component, the Enterprise Technology Enhancement component, finances 1) a technology modernization program that upgrades small and medium enterprises; 2) private regional/sectoral technology support centers; 3) special pilot programs that foster consultation among government, academia, and the private sector; and 4) a pilot venture capital fund, managed and controlled by the private sector."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":53},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"YZ,FE,ET,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Human development","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"48,44,66,41","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,8,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":53},{"Name":"Education","Percent":22},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":13},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20060721130753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060721130753","DocDate":"27-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060211333132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060211333132","DocDate":"04-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980630180629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980630180629","DocDate":"22-MAY-1998"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
