Approaches used will be through direct Government control and management of plantation operations and through mobilizing the cooperation of members of Peasant and Urban Dwellers' Associations in community tree planting activities.  The project will finance the establishment of 11,000 ha of state forest plantations and the upgrading of 13,000 ha of existing plantations occuring in large blocks.  Community forestry activities will consist of three components.  They will involve (i) state supervised forestry activities for the establishment of 1,600 ha of new plantations and upgrading of 1,000 ha of existing plantations; and (ii) self-help forestry activities for the establishment of about 8,500 ha of new plantations and upgrading of existing plantations; as well as (iii) planting trees around homesteads and community buildings, amounting altogether to about 250 ha.  The project will further support applied forestry research aimed at improving forest plantation technology, in-service and post graduate training to update staff knowledge and provide the necessary graduate forestry staff."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019113036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019113036","DocDate":"30-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36808_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36808_1_0","DocDate":"03-JUL-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092758","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092758","DocDate":"31-MAY-1986"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
