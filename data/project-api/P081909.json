The project will provide financing for only the first component, i.e., the procurement of OPV, to immunize all children of up to 5 years of age. Vaccines will be procured through the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). The second component, entails supplemental operations through three main activities: maintenance of a cold chain, social mobilization, and training. Before each round of immunization, extensive micro-planning, social mobilization campaigns, and training of participants will be conducted to ensure effective implementation, particularly, in reaching targeted groups. The third component provides support for epidemiological, and laboratory surveillance. A technical advisory group will meet periodically, who will provide the Government with detailed analysis of the program performance, its status, and recommended actions."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"63,59,64","mjthemecode":"8,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20070208112709","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20070208112709","DocDate":"25-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010030910083925","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030910083925","DocURL":"29-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010030910083925","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030910083925","DocDate":"29-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20041007143837","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041007143837","DocDate":"16-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2010030910111539","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030910111539","DocURL":"11-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030910111539","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030910111539","DocDate":"11-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20030429133601","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030429133601","DocDate":"21-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03022604024166","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03022604024166","DocDate":"19-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03021304154084","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03021304154084","DocDate":"11-FEB-2003"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
