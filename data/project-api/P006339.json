The project consists of two subprojects, each supported by a separate loan. The Sao Paulo basic health care subproject will help introduce a basic health care delivery model that will: (i) emphasize prevention of illness, as well as health and nutrition education, while providing low-cost curative care, which will cover about 90 percent of the health needs of an average community; (ii) provide services through a network of grassroots-level basic health units supported by community hospitals; (iii) support the introduction of an effective referral system and improved health service payment procedures; and (iv) promote the rational use of medical personnel through appropriate employment of paramedical staff and well-remunerated full-time physicians. It replicated elsewhere in the state and in Brazil. The national health policy studies subproject will support a program of studies designed to help the federal government formulate and implement medium-term objectives and plans for the entire health sector."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"57,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"HB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Basic health","code":"HB"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925173522","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925173522","DocDate":"30-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925173442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925173442","DocDate":"29-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99ae1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99ae1_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99adf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99adf_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e99add_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99add_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810190102547","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190102547","DocDate":"31-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716150437","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716150437","DocDate":"31-MAY-1984"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
