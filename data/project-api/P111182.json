PRSC are well-suited to address the challenges Vietnam currently faces. This operation aims to maintain the momentum for the reforms needed to transform Vietnam from a transition to a middle-income country. Emerging from massive poverty at the launching of Doi Moi in 1986, Vietnam is now on the verge of becoming a middle-income country. There was a noticeable acceleration, starting around 2001, in the government's drive towards relying on market mechanisms, building a multi-stakeholder economy and further integrating with the region and the world. Over these years, comprehensive economic reforms have led to rapid economic growth and remarkable progress on poverty reduction and other development outcomes. The share of the population living below the poverty line fell by nearly half; from 28.9 percent in 2002 to only 14.5 percent by 2008. Many of the remaining poor are from disadvantaged groups (e.g. ethnic minorities) or live in more isolated regions. Attaining middle-income status is seen as more than a threshold level of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, but as a way to emphasize the need for a set of modern institutions. It entails further financial deepening to support capital mobilization, the regulation of access to and pricing of infrastructure services, the gradual development of modern social insurance, more effective tools for environmental protection, legal and judiciary reforms, and the effective governance, among others. The SEDP 2006-2010 approved in June 2006 articulates this vision. As this PRSC cycle draws close to the end, the Government of Vietnam and development partners have approached the World Bank to discuss possible successor operations to PRSC.
