The expansion of services under the additional finance will incorporate the experience of the project implementation to date, and that from international experiences in the design of water and sanitation projects for low income communities. This additional finance is justified due to a funding shortfall beyond the Borrower's control - bankruptcy of the financing agency for secondary networks - where only 60 percent of the project's original expansion targets for water and sanitation services have been achieved, thus risking to substantially under-utilize a significant proportion of the Bank resources already been devoted to the expansion of primary networks, due to the absence of secondary networks to connect with households of intended beneficiaries. Strong political commitment has already been demonstrated for project implementation, and likewise, SEDAPAL demonstrated its implementation capacity by reaching (and exceeding as well) those targeted project components directly under its control."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":66},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":34},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"WA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development"],"themecode":"71","mjthemecode":"9,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":66},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":34}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20091016003249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091016003249","DocDate":"28-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202185803","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202185803","DocDate":"12-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202185803","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202185803","DocURL":"12-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_03022604094970","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03022604094970","DocDate":"24-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03011704085591","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03011704085591","DocDate":"08-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03042304070593","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03042304070593","DocDate":"13-DEC-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
