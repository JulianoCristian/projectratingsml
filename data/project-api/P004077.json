Annual net foreign exchange savings would amount to about $8 million as a result of the increases of about 75% and 240% in rice and barley production, respectively. About 40% of the 23,400 farm families (approximately 130,000 people) who will benefit directly from the project would be those whose present incomes fall below the poverty line. The principal features of the project are: provision of irrigation facilities - pumping stations, canals and on-farm development - on 7,090 ha of newly irrigated areas; improvement of irrigation and drainage and land consolidation on 3,710 ha of existing irrigated areas; improved water supply on 1,409 ha; construction of project field offices; and technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"36,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925014615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925014615","DocDate":"08-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902292833","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902292833","DocDate":"31-DEC-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84bf8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84bf8_1_0","DocDate":"22-DEC-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84bf7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84bf7_1_0","DocDate":"22-DEC-1977"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
