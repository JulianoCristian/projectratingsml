Specifically, the project aims to: (1) develop efficient institutions in the sector and improve the quality of public investment; (2) improve the efficiency in the use of energy resources through reforms in the pricing structure of electricity, petroleum products and woodfuels; (3) expand the access of the population to electricity; and (4) reduce negative environmental effects for the use of energy through the execution of charcoal efficiency and improved stoves program.  The project has two main components: institutional reform and small investments in biomass, household energy and power.  The credit will support: (a) institutional strengthening of the Directorate of Energy and the Directorate of Water Resources and Rural Energies; (b) a rehabilitation program for Regie de distribution d'eau et d'electricite (REGIDESO); (c) feasibility studies for selected hydropower plants and an update of the Power Sector Master Plan; (d) a charcoal efficiency program to disseminate improved techniques of production and sensitize charcoalers to the issue of deforestation; (e) an improved charcoal stoves program; (f) a household energy survey and a study of peat substitution; (g) a Master Plan for rural electrification; (h) extensions and new connections for the distribution system; and (i) improvements in the transmission system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Burundi!$!BI","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":88},"sector2":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":7},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"22,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Renewable energy"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BI","sectorcode":"BC,LE,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,81,39,84","mjthemecode":"11,4,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":88},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00050505302439","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00050505302439","DocDate":"07-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121013897","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121013897","DocURL":"04-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121014098","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121014098","DocDate":"04-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121013696","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121013696","DocDate":"04-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121014098","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121014098","DocURL":"04-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e37197_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e37197_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e37194_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e37194_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930040639","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930040639","DocDate":"28-FEB-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960930040834","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930040834","DocDate":"14-FEB-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Burundi"}},"facets":{}}
