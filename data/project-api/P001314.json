The project is composed of two components. The first, a geothermal component, which consists of : (i) drilling supplies and materials for 32 wells; (ii) procurement of a drilling rig rated for 2800 meters; (iii) drilling infrastructure and geothermal scientific equipment; and (iv) 36 man-months of technical assistance and an engineering study. The second component is energy preinvestment, which consists of : (i) a feasibility study of hydro resources of the Miriu-Sondu basin, and an engineering report for the Lower Miriu weir and power station; (ii) comparative reconnaissance on several potential hydro sites; (iii) an energy pricing study; (iv) a study of the Kenyan LPG supply; and (v) a rural electrification cost minimization study."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":16},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"40,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Renewable energy"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Housing construction"}],"docty":"Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"YC,TA,LZ,LE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,78,81,39,40","mjthemecode":"4,4,11,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":70},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":16},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":8},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042908574475","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042908574475","DocDate":"03-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042908555474","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042908555474","DocDate":"12-APR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010043015000877","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010043015000877","DocDate":"13-FEB-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030515113376","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030515113376","DocDate":"13-FEB-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e083aa_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e083aa_1_0","DocDate":"22-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e083a8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e083a8_1_0","DocDate":"22-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927014625","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927014625","DocDate":"02-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927014851","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927014851","DocDate":"02-DEC-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
