Traditionally, this has been public sector dominated, conservative, elite and driven by supply rather than demand. As part of the Government's National Agricultural Technology Transfer Program, the Project will achieve the following: (a) introduce a new approach, in support of the National System for Agricultural Technology Development and Transfer, including with measures to build institutional capacity, which would promote the development and testing of technical packages especially appropriate for small farmers, and to divulge new technology; (b) promoting private sector participation in agricultural research; (c) improving the quality and efficiency of agricultural research by introducing a demand driven, competitive selection system that will cofinance projects with universities and private and public sector entities; (d) supporting decentralization of agricultural research and extension activities by strengthening regional centers, training agricultural extensions, and disseminating information; and (e) revitalizing underused assets, both physical and human, that presently exist within Colombia's research services system. Research funded under the Project will ultimately help to reduce rural poverty, increase rural employment, and improve the competitiveness of Colombia's agricultural producers. The project will finance a four year program with the following two components: (a) technology development and adaptation; and, (b) institutional development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":54},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":38},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"51,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"BC,BH,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Rural development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,26,78,48","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"5,10,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":54},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":38},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20090818025823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090818025823","DocDate":"30-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040624102123","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040624102123","DocDate":"15-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123071576","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123071576","DocURL":"16-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123071375","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123071375","DocURL":"16-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123071677","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123071677","DocURL":"16-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123071576","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123071576","DocDate":"16-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123071677","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123071677","DocDate":"16-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123071375","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123071375","DocDate":"16-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3bfb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3bfb_1_0","DocDate":"20-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970311120724","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970311120724","DocDate":"24-MAR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
