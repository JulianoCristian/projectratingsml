This is the fourth DPG supporting the Republic of Haiti, after its successful reengagement with the donor community in 2005. The grant is a single-tranche operation supporting the FY2009-10 budget, with an additional co-financing of US$25 million by the Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF), of which the Bank is the partner agency. The operation supports maintaining sound economic governance in the post-earthquake period and strengthening the reforms started before the earthquake. First, the operation supports the implementation of the Government Action Plan for National Recovery and Development of Haiti presented to the international community in March 2010, aimed at rebuilding the country. The Government Action Plan puts emphasis on decentralization presents economic and social reforms as well as the institutional strengthening strategy of the authorities in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated Haiti on January 12, 2010. Second, it supports the government's program for enhancing transparency and accountability mechanisms, especially in view of the massive pledges made by donors to support the reconstruction process. The Government Action Plan and governance program are in line with the strategy contained in the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS/DSNCRP) for the period 2008-2010, of which one pillar aims at strengthening state capacity and management of public resources."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Haiti!$!HT","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":12},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":88},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Program Document,Financing Agreement,Summary of Discussion,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"HT","sectorcode":"LT,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,29","mjthemecode":"2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":75},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20120522021720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120522021720","DocDate":"22-MAR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20120424000433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120424000433","DocDate":"22-MAR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011110217574115","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011110217574115","DocDate":"02-NOV-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011041716522007","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011041716522007","DocDate":"17-APR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011020810581107","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011020810581107","DocDate":"08-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100716041741","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100716041741","DocDate":"09-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"090224b081af6a50_3_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081af6a50_3_0","DocDate":"10-AUG-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000333038_20100810031347","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100810031347","DocDate":"05-AUG-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000386194_20110704094057","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110704094057","DocDate":"09-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100706115358","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100706115358","DocDate":"21-MAY-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Haiti"}},"facets":{}}
