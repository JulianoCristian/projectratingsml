To achieve the above objectives, the project will finance a combination of institutional development and operational support activities which will address issues such as key health management and planning constraints, including those affecting drug supply, vehicle and equipment maintenance, and strategic planning needs for fertility control. The project will also fund health operational support in two health regions which were selected on the basis of having infrastructure, population characteristics and management capabilities."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"17,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"69,27,67,57","mjthemecode":"7,8,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214170253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214170253","DocDate":"20-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123233852","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123233852","DocURL":"13-JUL-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07f0a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07f0a_1_0","DocDate":"05-MAY-1988"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
