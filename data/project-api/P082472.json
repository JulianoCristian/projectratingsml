The Credit portion will finance the reconstruction of secondary rural access infrastructure--primarily bridges. The Grant will finance the rehabilitation of tertiary rural access infrastructure and technical assistance to the Government for implementing its NEEP. The project will comprise two components: A) labor-based rural access rehabilitation reconstruction subprojects; and, B) technical assistance to support the Government's overall NEEP. The Project is expected to create a minimum of 6,000,000 unskilled labor days of employment, and to rehabilitate a minimum of 2000 km of rural roads and 2300 m of bridges. The labor-based sub-projects are expected to provide high social returns in the short run and contribute to economic progress in the long-term. The employment generated will reduce income vulnerability levels and create infrastructure which will improve access to markets and services. By removing access bottlenecks, the project will help integrate the village economy with the regional and national markets. The technical assistance component will lead to better allocation of resources, higher productivity and outputs, and help mobilize further donor resources for productive employment creation. The project builds upon working implementation arrangements, but even so its implementation is  expected to be dif"},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"39,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Agreement,Agreement,Project Information Document,Technical Annex,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"AF","sectorcode":"TA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"58,76,78,56","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,10,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":50},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080805040153","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080805040153","DocDate":"20-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000020439_20070521142521","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070521142521","DocDate":"16-FEB-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202150962","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202150962","DocURL":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202150962","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202150962","DocDate":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0304230409218","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0304230409218","DocDate":"03-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000160016_20030606142013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030606142013","DocDate":"26-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03042304113615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03042304113615","DocDate":"18-APR-2003"}],"countryname":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
