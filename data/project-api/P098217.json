The closing date of the project will be extended from December 31, 2010 until August 31, 2011. The extension is necessary to allow for the completion of ongoing activities under the complementing Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) grant, which finances key reform elements directly linked to the achievement of several outcome indicators. The activities financed by the PHRD grant suffered delays due to several reorganizations at the Ministry of education and science and at the two implementing agencies, the National Curriculum and Assessment Center (NCAC) and the Teacher Professional Development Center (TPDC)."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"Central government
