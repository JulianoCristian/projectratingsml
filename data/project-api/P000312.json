It will expand Camdev's plantations from 22,400 ha to 33,100 ha. The new investment is expected to yield a rate of return of about 11 to 16 percent, depending on the valuation placed on labor costs, as well as substantial indirect benefits. Camdev employs a labor force of about 12,000, for whom there are few other employment opportunities and supplies about 30 percent of West Cameroon's exports. The Agriculture Project will increase employment and, by the late 1970's, will double Camdev's contribution to exports. Its success is therefore crucial for the economy of Cameroon."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cameroon!$!CM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"18,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CM","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191226317","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191226317","DocDate":"12-OCT-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902581510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902581510","DocDate":"31-MAR-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67da5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67da5_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67da4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67da4_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e836_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e836_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e834_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e834_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903485444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903485444","DocDate":"28-FEB-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20120105234958","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120105234958","DocDate":"17-FEB-1967"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cameroon"}},"facets":{}}
