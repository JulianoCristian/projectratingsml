The main items of the project are 380 kv and 154 kv substations, 154 kv transmission lines, 30 kv transformers, and low-voltage capacitators with a total cost of about $65 million, including a foreign exchange component of $26 million. All imported materials required for the project would be financed from the Bank loan with the exception of steel for transmission towers and medium voltage transformers for which finance has been arranged from bilateral sources; these would cost about $4 million. $2 million has been included in the Bank loan for interest during construction."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"24,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903184984","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903184984","DocDate":"30-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a4b8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a4b8_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a4b7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a4b7_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903332552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903332552","DocDate":"31-MAY-1971"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
