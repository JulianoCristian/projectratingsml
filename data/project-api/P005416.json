The Jerada mine project aims to strengthen CdM's organization and planning capabilities, and to increase production from 0.8 mtpy to 1.0 mtpy by 1988. It would concentrate production in a single mine; simplify the mine's infrastructure for increased productivity and production; and improve safety, health and working conditions. The project would comprise: (a) a drilling program to prepare underground development work and shaft sinking; (b) underground development work to prepare future mining areas and to simplify existing mining areas. It would further include; (c) sinking of an additional vertical shaft to maintain production capacity after completion of the project and depletion of CdM's smaller mines; (d) installation of underground and surface equipment to increase efficiency, production capacity and to improve safety and health; and (e) technical assistance to CdM."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"27,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"NN","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining","code":"NX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","code":"NN"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904162653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904162653","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135809","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135809","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
