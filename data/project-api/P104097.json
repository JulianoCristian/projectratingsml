It has become increasingly integrated with the world economy, and formally joined the WTO in January 2007. This first credit in a programmatic series of three, would support policy and institutional actions to improve the results of one of Vietnam's principal National Target Programs (NTP) for poverty reduction: the re-designed Program for Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas (2006-2010), known more familiarly in Vietnam as Program 135, Phase 2 (P135-2). The credit would support policy and institutional actions to improve the results of P135-2 with particular reference to: (i) improved poverty targeting of program resource allocation; (ii) deepening and scaling-up of community-driven approaches to planning, managing, operating and maintaining basic rural infrastructure; (iii) enhanced fiduciary transparency and accountability in program implementation through wider use of social audit approaches; and (iv) process monitoring and impact evaluation. Critical aspects of this reform agenda have already been demonstrated at scale under ongoing IDA- and other ODA-supported initiatives in Vietnam covering at least a half of all the provinces, districts and communes targeted for inclusion in P135-2 (see maps and Annex 7). Those elements of the reform agenda supported by the proposed series of operations are described in the attached Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1)."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":16},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"BC,JB,AZ,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,27,54,77","mjthemecode":"10,6,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000350881_20091016095309","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20091016095309","DocDate":"21-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"007699930_2007101916253030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007699930_2007101916253030","DocDate":"17-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"007699930_2007101916253030","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007699930_2007101916253030","DocURL":"17-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000310607_20070228093110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070228093110","DocDate":"14-FEB-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20061206092803","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20061206092803","DocDate":"28-NOV-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20061206093105","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20061206093105","DocDate":"28-NOV-2006"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}},"facets":{}}
