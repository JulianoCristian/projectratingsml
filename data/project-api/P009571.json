The project aims at utilizing these basic inputs for production of calcium carbide, mainly for export, to help Bhutan earn much-needed foreign exchange revenues for its economic development. The project would augment the country's limited industrial base, increase financial self-reliance and help train manpower in industrial production, mining and forestry. The project, with a capacity to produce 22,000 tons per year of calcium carbide, would be located at Pasakha in Southern Bhutan. The project would include: (i) a calcium carbide plant; (ii) limestone mining; (iii) forestry; and (iv) charcoal plants. In addition, the project provides for necessary infrastructure, technical assistance and training."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Bhutan!$!BT","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BT","sectorcode":"IC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","code":"IC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925223202","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925223202","DocDate":"25-NOV-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e0618a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0618a_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e06188_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e06188_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702140338","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702140338","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Bhutan"}},"facets":{}}
