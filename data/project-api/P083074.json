The operation is part of a concerted effort by multilateral institutions to help Argentina during the transition period and lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive reform program to be developed and implemented with the new administration scheduled to take office at the end of M a y 2003. The transition loan will help strengthen Argentina's ability to resume growth and protect its human capital through a series of initial reform steps taken by the current Government. These steps support (i) the continued deficit reduction efforts by the provinces, (ii) the elimination of quasi-monies, (iii) measures to ensure that social protection programs respond adequately to the economic and social crisis, and (iv) measures to ensure coverage of basic health services to the most vulnerable through increased budget allocations to priority programs and improved access to pharmaceuticals."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"500,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"JA,JB,BZ,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Economic management","Human development","Economic management"],"themecode":"24,69,21,54,63","mjthemecode":"8,6,1,8,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040708110025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040708110025","DocDate":"30-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202195663","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202195663","DocURL":"23-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202195663","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202195663","DocDate":"23-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20030506110723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030506110723","DocDate":"02-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03043004030294","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03043004030294","DocDate":"30-APR-2003"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
