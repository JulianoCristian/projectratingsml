It would extend the application of major changes in livestock production techniques aimed at increasing the carrying capacity of the land and the productivity of the breeding herds to help meet Spain's increasing demand for meat. A primary objective would be to resolve problems of farm structure and land tenure presently limiting farm modernization and production in the north of Spain. The project would finance the development of about: (a) 400 cattle production farms in the Southwest; (b) 200 cattle fattening farms in the Southwest; (c) 150 sheep production farms in the Southwest; (d) 450 dairy farms in the North; (e) 350 cattle production farms in the North; (f) 50 cattle fattening farms in the North; (g) 100 milk sheep farms in marginal cereal zones (Southwest and/or Central)."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Spain!$!ES","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ES","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000178830_9810190106405","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190106405","DocDate":"07-NOV-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902234949","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902234949","DocDate":"30-APR-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7239b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7239b_1_0","DocDate":"15-APR-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901122339","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901122339","DocDate":"28-FEB-1975"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Spain"}},"facets":{}}
