The government requests for an extension of the project beyond June 30, 2010 to enable them to effectively ban the use of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) (other than banked supplies) in the servicing sector (small- to medium-scale enterprises) as well as complete the remaining support activities. This is consistent with the decision of the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol in its 21st meeting of parties to the Montreal Protocol held last November 3-8, 2009, approving the revised National CFC Phase out Project (NCPP) Annual Program which describes the action plan and the disbursement schedule for the remaining funds to complete the project. Likewise, the ISP also received fresh funds from the Fund to support its work on or before December 2011. However, the World Bank finds it sufficient to extend the project up to only until June 30, 2011 as the fresh funds released from the Fund amounts to only $158,491.00 in addition to the remaining project fund of US$1,865,000."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"sector4":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"10,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"FA,BC,YB,YW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"82,44,84","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":67},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":31},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20120423235325","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120423235325","DocDate":"29-MAR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011012422215866","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011012422215866","DocDate":"24-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000334955_20100820024352","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100820024352","DocDate":"30-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060110055016","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060110055016","DocDate":"06-OCT-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
