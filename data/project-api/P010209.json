Integrated irrigation, drainage, and water management measures will permit increased cropping intensities and a reduction in abandoned land in an area of more than 0.5 million ha. Principal project components include:  (a) completion of a 300 km outfall drain and remodelling of existing drains to dispose of saline effluent to the Arabian Sea; (b) installation of a surface and subsurface drainage network in the three subareas; and (c) installation of a power distribution system to supply the drainage tubewells and drain pumps.  The project further provides for:  (d) introduction of on-farm water management practices including renovation of about 920 watercourses and precision land levelling; (e) remodelling of the Nara and Jamrao Canals, as well as construction of the Chotiari Reservoir, to provide supplemental irrigation water for the project area.  Finally, the project includes; (f) technical assistance for project design and implementation."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":74},"sector2":{"Name":"Power","Percent":26},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"LD,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,83,85,74","mjthemecode":"9,11,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":74},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":26}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05cce_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05cce_1_0","DocDate":"13-DEC-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05ccd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05ccd_1_0","DocDate":"13-DEC-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05ccb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05ccb_1_0","DocDate":"13-DEC-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151423","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151423","DocDate":"30-NOV-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904163533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904163533","DocDate":"30-NOV-1984"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
