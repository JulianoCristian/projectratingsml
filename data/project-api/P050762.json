There are four components. The first raises schools to minimum operational standards through educating and certifying teachers, supplying basic furniture and equipment, financing school improvement investments, and financing school-managed rehabilitation of physical facilities. The second component establishes a school development process by designing and supporting school development plans; and financing school subprojects. The third component carries out school microplanning and develops and tests standard architectural plans for additional school places. The fourth component builds management capacity in schools, municipalities, and states; provides specialized teaching and learning improvement programs; fosters community participation; strengthens national education information systems and programs; and finances project management."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"62,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"ET,BC,BH,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Urban development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,55,71,65","mjthemecode":"8,9,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":55},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14},{"Name":"Education","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000094946_02073104145845","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02073104145845","DocDate":"20-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0201110404374","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0201110404374","DocDate":"24-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201392811","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201392811","DocURL":"07-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201392811","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201392811","DocDate":"07-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110831","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110831","DocDate":"16-MAR-1998"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
