It also proposes to extend the closing date of the original Development Credit Agreement by 18 months, from December 31, 2007 to June 30, 2009. The proposed additional credit would help finance the costs associated with the financing gap under the current IDA-financed project until a multi-donor sector wide (SWAP) financial sector program is in place. The additional credit will also allow the project to expand its activities beyond the results originally sought under Phase I and scale up the project's impact and development
