First, new employment opportunities will be generated.  Second, Zairian entrepreneurship will be developed.  Third, the participation of financial intermediaries will be increased through large branch networks in the development of SSEs.  This will contribute to the decentralization of economic activity.  Finally, Zaire's ability to prepare, appraise and supervise SSE projects will be developed.
