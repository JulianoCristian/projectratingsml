The project includes the following three components:  1) Policy reforms and institutional development will promote integrated water resources management by establishing a rational tariff policy, increasing cost recovery and establishing Morocco's first BRA (River Basin Agency).  2)  Capacity building in water resource planning, information systems, and technology will improve national and river basin planning, monitoring, and management capability.  Water conservation technology will also be fostered through applied research.  3) Investments in water mobilization and quality will improve productivity through rehabilitation and maintenance of dams, safety monitoring, and groundwater sewerage systems in small urban centers."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Water
