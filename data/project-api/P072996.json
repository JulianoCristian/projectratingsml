There are four main project components. The first component has two sub-components: The first concerns participatory research aimed at developing and testing new technologies with farmer participation to increase irrigated production and add value. The second involves advisory services, aimed at ensuring that farmers are provided relevant and effective advice on production and marketing on a regular and timely basis, and aimed at disseminating technologies proved effective in the pilot phase of the project. The second component comprises three elements: The first supports the Nigerien Association for the Promotion of Private Irrigation (ANPIP) in its acquiring increasing autonomy, sustainability, and accountability to its members, and also provides support to producers' organizations. The second subcomponent supports the government's efforts in promoting private irrigation. The third subcomponent is a pilot, testing private management of selected offices for irrigated perimeters (ONAHA) to develop models enabling the government to disengage itself from being directly involved in these schemes. The third component finances an irrigation investment fund and microfinance institutions. The fourth component puts in place an action plan aimed at mitigating environmental risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Niger!$!NE","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectAbstract>Les notes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9es au Projet de promotion de l\u2019irrigation aupr\u00e8s du secteur priv\u00e9 au Niger sont les suivantes\u00a0: les r\u00e9sultats du projet \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s satisfaisants, le ratio risque-d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9tait important, la performance de la Banque mondiale a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e satisfaisante et la performance de l\u2019emprunteur a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e mod\u00e9r\u00e9ment satisfaisante. Les le\u00e7ons apprises comprennent\u00a0: l\u2019accent mis par le projet sur des installations d\u2019irrigation efficientes avec la pleine participation du secteur priv\u00e9 demeure valide et tr\u00e8s pertinent pour le Niger. La conception du projet et les technologies utilis\u00e9es pourraient servir d\u2019exemple pour d\u2019autres pays faisant face \u00e0 des contraintes beaucoup moins importantes. Les investissements dans l\u2019irrigation dans le cadre de ce projet ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019un co\u00fbt moyen de 2\u00a0000 dollars par hectare. Ces investissements peuvent apporter des am\u00e9liorations mesurables au bien-\u00eatre des agriculteurs et g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un retour sur investissement \u00e9lev\u00e9, possiblement d\u2019environ 20\u00a0%. Le projet montre que des responsabilit\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires sont cr\u00e9\u00e9es pour le secteur priv\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il g\u00e8re des projets qui sont tr\u00e8s visibles et d\u2019une grande importance politique. La transparence est essentielle dans les domaines de la gestion financi\u00e8re et de la passation des march\u00e9s.
