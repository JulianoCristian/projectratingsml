In particular, the project will focus on: a) strengthening the capacity of the National Council for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (NACVET) to respond to the short-term training needs of those employed in the informal sector; b) involving indigenous trade associations in designing competency based training programs, in selecting participants for training, and in choosing the tools to be included in equipment kits; c) creating closer links between trade associations, public and private training institutions, and the Government; d) re-orienting the focus of private and public training institutions away from the provision of long pre-employment training to the provision of short post-employment competency-based training for those in the informal sector. To achieve this, the project will include: 1) practical skill training of informal apprentices in five skill areas; 2) practical skill training and entrepreneurship training of informal sector master craftsmen and women; 3) ensuring that trainees have access to essential high-quality tools; 4) support to public and private training institutions; and 5) training program development, evaluation, and monitoring."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":77},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":23},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"9,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"BC,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"65,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":77},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":23}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02012504083948","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02012504083948","DocDate":"28-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121252933","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121252933","DocURL":"30-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121252933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121252933","DocDate":"30-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23e54_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23e54_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007134520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007134520","DocDate":"09-MAR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
