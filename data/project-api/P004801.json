Specifically, the project will involve: (a) construction of 19 115/22kV substations aggregating about 800 MVA in capacity and 19 115kV subtransmission lines with a total length of about 925 km; (b) construction of abut 5,500 km of 22kV lines, 84 MVA of distribution transformers, 8,000 km of LV lines and connections to 120,000 consumers; (c) consulting services regarding corporatization and potential regionalization and privatization of PEA; and (d) consulting services for engineering design. The Bank loan will finance will finance the subtransmission line component together with the foreign cost elements of the distribution system development program. The foreign costs of the substation components will be financed by Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau and UK ODA. During the course of the project, PEA will formulate and implement pilot Demand-Side Management programs in the provincial areas for improving the efficiency of lightening systems, refrigerators, air conditioners and agricultural pumping."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,78,43","mjthemecode":"4,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123060936","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123060936","DocURL":"27-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123061037","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123061037","DocURL":"27-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123060936","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123060936","DocDate":"27-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005040849","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005040849","DocDate":"18-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005041140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005041140","DocDate":"18-AUG-1994"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
