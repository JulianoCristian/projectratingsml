The additional resources will finance the costs associated with scaling up those components curtailed when the project was restructured after Hurricane Ivan in November 2004 to address emergency infrastructure needs, namely improving education quality and strengthening management. The additional financing will continue to support the project's key development objectives, which are to: (a) increase equitable access to secondary education; (b) improve the quality of the teaching and learning process; and (c) strengthen management of the sector and the governance of the schools. It will especially enable the project to achieve its expected outcomes and impact on the second and third objectives."},"country_namecode":"Grenada!$!GD","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Procurement Plan,Board Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GD","sectorcode":"ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0003579868","geoLocName":"Tanteen","latitude":"12.03333","longitude":"-61.73333","country":"GD"},{"geoLocId":"0003579926","geoLocName":"Saint George","latitude":"12.05","longitude":"-61.73333","country":"GD"},{"geoLocId":"0003579932","geoLocName":"Saint David","latitude":"12.05","longitude":"-61.666672","country":"GD"},{"geoLocId":"0003579938","geoLocName":"Saint Andrew","latitude":"12.11667","longitude":"-61.650002","country":"GD"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"66","mjthemecode":"8,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120123002104","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120123002104","DocDate":"27-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011021517523267","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011021517523267","DocDate":"15-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000020953_20090312082930","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20090312082930","DocDate":"05-NOV-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20060405130803","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060405130803","DocDate":"01-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000160016_20041105105219","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20041105105219","DocDate":"05-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202154171","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202154171","DocDate":"01-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202153970","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202153970","DocDate":"01-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202154272","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202154272","DocURL":"01-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202153970","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202153970","DocURL":"01-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202154272","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202154272","DocDate":"01-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20030616170816","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030616170816","DocDate":"03-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03013004044215","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03013004044215","DocDate":"23-DEC-2002"}],"countryname":"Grenada"}},"facets":{}}
