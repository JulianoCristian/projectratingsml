The project will:  (a) strengthen agriculture, animal husbandry and animal and plant quarantine management capability through improved information, computer networking and monitoring and evaluation systems; (b) reorganize crop and livestock extension systems from national to county level; (c) improve extension services by providing facilities, upgrading skills of technical staff and improving their recommendations through farm-level demand-driven research programs; (d) reorganize seed centers to separate their production from certification and regulation roles and promote seed commercialization; (e) strengthen veterinary and preventive animal health services, establish a well-coordinated national breed improvement program, and tighten pharmaceutical, agrochemical and feed quality control; and (f) promote cost recovery for services provided to farmers.  The project will also strengthen project management at all levels by providing facilities, training and technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
