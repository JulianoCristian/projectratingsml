Currently the World Bank and the government are the main financiers of the Bulgaria SIF. The government sees the social inclusion project framework as developing into an instrument for facilitating the use of European structural funds. However, the European structural funds are expected to become accessible in late 2007 or 2008. In order to maintain the institutional capacity and allow it time to adjust to the requirements of the European Union, the SIF would need a full investment program in 2007 and 2008."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection
