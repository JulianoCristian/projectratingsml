The reallocation is necessary to ensure processing of payments under the oil supply contract in full. The allocated amount under category 4 'goods under part 1.A (ii) of the project' became insufficient due to exchange rate fluctuations that reduced the available International Development Association (IDA) funds in US dollars. On August 5, 2010 the Bank has received the letter from the Ministry of Finance requesting to reallocate the amount of SDR 197,091 from category 5 to category 4. However, it is proposed to reallocate the whole current allocation of SDR 213,846 from the category 5 'consultant services and training under part 1.B of the project' to category 4 'goods under part 1.A (ii) of the project' in order to cover current commitments under the oil supply contract. The training and consultancy services needs will be met from the allocations under the additional financing."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in
