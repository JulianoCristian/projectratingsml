The components call for: 1) enhanced skills within the Petroleum Division's expertise in gas resource evaluation, market assessment, processing, and distribution. Skills will be upgraded through a needs-based training program, consisting of on-the-job training, short courses, industrial know-how, and post-graduate studies. Management training will be provided to cover project management, and implementation, while other Government departments will also participate in relevant courses, and training assignments, to promote coherent policies, and understanding of the petroleum industry, to enable consistent, sector management practices within the government; 2) studies, to be undertaken in-house, by the Petroleum Division staff, under experts supervision, covering liquid petroleum gas (LPG) policy, and utilization; gas-based industrial development, and power generation opportunities, and gas transportation and export, as well as gas pipeline, and facility regulations. Institutional studies will address the transition of the Petroleum Division into a Statutory authority; 3) promotion of investment opportunities for gas export, and domestic utilization, through seminars, and public awareness campaigns."},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine!$!PG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":73},"sector2":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":27},"theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"7,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PG","sectorcode":"LC,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,40,45","mjthemecode":"5,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":73},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":27}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070503151737","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070503151737","DocDate":"26-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201532909","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201532909","DocURL":"16-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00051605321684","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051605321684","DocDate":"02-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00011905351076","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00011905351076","DocDate":"14-JAN-2000"}],"countryname":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine"}},"facets":{}}
