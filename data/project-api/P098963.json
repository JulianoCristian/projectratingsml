This RSRC-2 is a one-year budget support operation to be disbursed in two tranches. It will address policy and institutional bottlenecks in public sector management, as well as rural and human development, where it is closely linked to ongoing investment operations. Within a medium-term framework, and building on the previous budget support operation (RSRC-1) as well as ongoing projects in agriculture, education, health, and population (upcoming), this two tranche operation will continue focusing on overcoming policy constraints and institutional bottlenecks in: (i) public sector management; (ii) agricultural growth and rural development; and (iii) human development, including demographic growth and gender issues. The RSRCs have been built around a medium-term results framework which has identified the proposed reforms in the rural and human development areas, as well as subsequent steps to further support the growth agenda. This approach is aligned with the Government's strategy, reflected in the Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which identifies agriculture as the engine of growth of the economy, in the short-and medium-term."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Niger!$!NE","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Deuxi\u00e8me projet PPD pour le d\u00e9veloppement rural et les secteurs sociaux</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le deuxi\u00e8me don en faveur de la politique rurale et sociale (RSRC-2), qui fait partie d\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations de pr\u00eats \u00e0 la politique de d\u00e9veloppement (PPD), continuera \u00e0 aider le Gouvernement nig\u00e9rien \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer la prestation de services aux pauvres et \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre des r\u00e9formes de la gestion du secteur public pour assurer un financement appropri\u00e9 dans les secteurs critiques de l\u2019\u00e9conomie.
