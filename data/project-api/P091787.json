It also seeks to support an important set of cross-cutting reforms, in areas ranging from policy coordination, to improved financial and human resource practices. It will be deemed successful if capacity is strengthened within the Prime Minister's office, so that performance monitoring, administrative reform, and policy coordination functions are established and functioning well by project completion. The project components call for: 1) Improving policymaking, management of the reform process, and strategic communications. Capacity will be strengthened at the Cabinet Secretariat, to improve its strategic focus, and reduce routine business flows. The component will also strengthen capacity within the Prime Ministry to improve provision of strategic guidance, and oversight regarding the Public Sector Reform Program, and in addition, will strengthen communications. 2) Performance management and service delivery. This component will ensure the publication and monitoring - at the ministerial and institutional levels - of performance standards regarding service delivery to citizens, through training and capacity building to improve its quality, and cost-effectiveness. 3) Institutional streamlining. Through the establishment of simplified, effective structures, the component will focus on the Government's core functions, progressively reviewing its mandate, status, organization, functions, and administrative efficiency. Increased accountability for policy and operations will be supported to improve administrative efficiency. 4) Improving human resource and financial management practices and procedures.
