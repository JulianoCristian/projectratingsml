Ghana's agricultural sector is on a growth path and opportunities exist for significant further development. Structural transformation of Ghana's economy is ongoing. The contribution of the country's services sector to the economy has overtaken that of the agricultural sector, the latter now no longer in first place. Poverty levels are falling, and Ghana as a nation is largely food secure. The AgDPO 3 is a single tranche credit for US$57 million equivalent and the first Development Policy Operation (DPO) in a new series intended to help the Government of Ghana (GoG) implement the Medium Term Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (METASIP). The operation supports the development objectives set in the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) for 2010-2013. The GSGDA emphasizes the need for greater executive efficiency, transparency and accountability to provide the adequate setting for the reduction of poverty and socio-economic inequalities through agricultural, private sector, infrastructure and human resource development. The operation supports the Government's efforts to address the development needs of the northern part of the country. To address the growing regional discrepancy between the North and the South, the Government's agriculture programs feature a strong focus on the North, evidenced by the Savanna Accelerated Development Agency's (SADA) program that facilitates commercial agriculture development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Ghana \u2013 Troisi\u00e8me Op\u00e9ration de politique de d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019agriculture</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>L\u2019objectif du programme de la troisi\u00e8me Op\u00e9ration de politique de d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019agriculture est d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la productivit\u00e9 et la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 de l'agriculture ghan\u00e9enne.
