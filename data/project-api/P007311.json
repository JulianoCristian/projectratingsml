It would specifically : 1) rationalize the allocation of resources for primary health care (PHC) within a more coherent institutional framework, 2) implement, in the Western health region, a Basic Health Services Delivery model (BHSDM), based on the GOH stated PHC policy, and conceived as a framework for all public and private health activities; and 3) support the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) medium term prevention and control program, and the national tuberculosis (TB) control program. These objectives would be supported by 3 key measures : 1) restructuring of the MSPP budget over the project implementation period, 2) increased coordination, dialogue and integration between the private and public sectors, and 3) the implementation of personnel recruitment and retirement policies as provided by current legal regulations."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Haiti!$!HT","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":87},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"28,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"HT","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"67,88,25","mjthemecode":"2,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":87},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0202230401183","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0202230401183","DocDate":"06-SEP-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042814304033","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042814304033","DocDate":"21-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042814285532","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042814285532","DocDate":"09-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042814271231","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042814271231","DocDate":"14-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042814252330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042814252330","DocDate":"06-FEB-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030415452334","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030415452334","DocDate":"02-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0809e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0809e_1_0","DocDate":"16-JAN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928034109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928034109","DocDate":"28-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928034252","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928034252","DocDate":"28-NOV-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Haiti"}},"facets":{}}
