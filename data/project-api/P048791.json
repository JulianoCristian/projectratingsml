The main components will: 1) support the development of a detailed plan for biodiversity, and forest conservation in the Central Caucasus region, and, support corridor conservation planning in Eastern Georgia. Biodiversity studies will be financed, and, a policy/legal framework will rationalize the mandates of the Framework Law on Protected Areas, and the Forest Code for the Central Caucasus; communal vegetation types, and rapid biological assessments will be mapped to implement corridor plans in the Eastern Caucasus Mountains; 2) establish protected areas management, and, build awareness of biodiversity conservation. Monitoring, and applied research will guide park management, and evaluate results of management actions, through the development of an information base, livestock assessments, and through special studies focused on species, plants, and animals to improve management decision-making. Training on protected areas management planning will be provided, to enforce ranger practices, and, enhance business planning; 3) reorganize, and strengthen the Department of Protected Areas, through: training in park administration; revenue account management; technical training in protected areas, and resource management; and, monitoring biodiversity programs; and, 4) finance project management, and operating costs within the Department of Protected Areas."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"8,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"GE","sectorcode":"BC,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,80,82","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":70},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090805004455","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090805004455","DocDate":"30-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0106080416303","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0106080416303","DocDate":"01-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01051504005561","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01051504005561","DocDate":"03-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00072905363923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00072905363923","DocDate":"31-JUL-2000"}],"countryname":"Georgia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
