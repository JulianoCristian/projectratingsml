There are three main project components. This component focuses on education: 1) It assists the policy design, implementation planning, and training of a comprehensive decentralized system of education funding; and develops management systems and related software aimed at capturing essential school data and information, and builds an information culture. 2) It strengthens governance and the institutional capacity of the University of Pristina by providing technical support to legislate the university's mandate and operating procedures, and develops its strategic planning and management capacity. 3) It develops the staff's capacity to define modern standards and assess student performance. 4) It develops the education department's governance and management structures. The second component develops a health and welfare strategy through 1) designing and implementing mechanisms for the financing system; and providing technical assistance to develop a social protection strategy; 2) strengthening the capacity of the health insurance fund; and 3) preparing an implementation plan for restructuring the health sector. The third component provides critical information on the project concerning financing and the public's use of social services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kosovo!$!XK","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"Non-compulsory health finance","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"4,440,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory health finance"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"XK","sectorcode":"BC,ET,JA,FB,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"87,61,65,67","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Non-compulsory health finance","code":"FB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":34},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":33},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":14},{"Name":"Education","Percent":11},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009486_20041228093909","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009486_20041228093909","DocDate":"21-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051416200238","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051416200238","DocDate":"10-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051416213082","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051416213082","DocDate":"10-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00052305320182","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00052305320182","DocDate":"02-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00050305305291","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00050305305291","DocDate":"14-APR-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kosovo"}},"facets":{}}
