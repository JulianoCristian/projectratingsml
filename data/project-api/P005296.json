The main objectives of the project are to: (a) formulate and implement reforms to improve the overall policy framework for the commercialization of the telecommunications sector and TCC (Jordan Telecommunications Corporation); (b) expand network capacity, improve service quality, increase geographic coverage and introduce new value-added services; (c) strengthen TCC's capacity to develop and implement competitive strategies for procurement, financing and system planning; (d) help the Government and TCC to revise telecommunications pricing policy and tariffs to reflect changes in cost structure and market demand; and (e) support TCC in conducting a review of its organizational structure. The project, which covers TCC's entire revised 1988-92 telecommunications investment program, comprises consultancy services, switching equipment, local networks, additional microwave and cable transmission links, a new switching center, a new satellite earth station, computer systems, and ongoing works still to be completed.
