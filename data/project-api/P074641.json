Jamaica has met the five eligibility criteria for country participation. This project aims to support selected activities of Jamaica's HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (NSP). Using a multi-sectoral approach, it assists the Government of Jamaica in curbing the spread of the HIV epidemic through 1) the expansion of preventive programs targeted to high-risk groups as well as the general population; 2) the strengthening of treatment, care, and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); and 3) the strengthening of Jamaica's multisectoral capacity to respond to the epidemic."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de prevenci\u00f3n y control del VIH/SIDA (Segunda fase del pr\u00e9stamo con programa adaptable multi-pa\u00eds para la prevenci\u00f3n y el control del VIH/SIDA en el Caribe)</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"JM","sectorcode":"BC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,59,88,67","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":90},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090722225555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090722225555","DocDate":"11-FEB-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031616155470","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031616155470","DocDate":"10-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02011804102331","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02011804102331","DocDate":"08-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01101904281612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01101904281612","DocDate":"10-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061015150361","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061015150361","DocDate":"21-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02030604012044","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02030604012044","DocDate":"25-JAN-2001"}],"countryname":"Jamaica"}},"facets":{}}
