It would support the regional diversification strategy, address the needs of medium- and small-sale industries and broaden and strengthen the infrastructure of the national industrial training system. In particular, it would reorganize the structure and procedures and expand the staff of the National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC) and establish a system of contracting for sector specific training in seven priority industrial and service subsectors, for 76,000 employees. This would include apprentice training, training adult workers, and supervisor upgrading. Employers would participate in the organization, financing and management of training, and a strategy of on-the-job training would be promoted. In addition, the trade testing and certification system would be expanded on a national level."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"24,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006144703","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006144703","DocDate":"17-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925121457","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925121457","DocDate":"18-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9742e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9742e_1_0","DocDate":"21-SEP-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902403052","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902403052","DocDate":"31-AUG-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
