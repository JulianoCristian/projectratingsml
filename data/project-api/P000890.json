The project involves several objectives including: strengthening the State Enterprises Commission (SEC) to manage the SOE reform program and monitor and evaluate SOE performance; improving management and performance in priority SOEs; training and the introduction of performance agreements; and reducing the burden of the sector on Government through divestiture. To that end, the project aims to provide sector-wide assistance for: (i) strengthening the SEC to manage the reform program, design and implementation of a performance monitoring system including performance agreements; and (ii) advisory/consulting services for implementing the first phase of the divestiture program. In addition, the project aims to finance a SOE Restructuring Fund to provide assistance to selected SOEs for audits and corporate plans to identify restructuring measures required to achieve financial viability, and to implement operational and managerial improvements."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":31},"sector2":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":18},"sector3":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":17},"sector5":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"10,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"AZ,YZ,TZ,LZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,42,43,30","mjthemecode":"2,4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":31},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":18},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":17},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":17},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3971023103718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971023103718","DocDate":"30-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120315424","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120315424","DocURL":"30-OCT-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120315424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120315424","DocDate":"30-OCT-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36cb9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36cb9_1_0","DocDate":"13-OCT-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926111841","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926111841","DocDate":"31-AUG-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
