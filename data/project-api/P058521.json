There are seven project components. The first rehabilitates high voltage transmission network lines started under the Second Electric Power Reconstruction Project (report no. 20167). The second component finances reconstruction of key transmission substations. The third component establishes a supervisory control and data acquisition system and associated telecommunications facilities. The fourth component funds investments at hydropower stations to improve safety and availabilty. The fifth component makes investments in thermal power stations to control pollution. The sixth component supports distribution substation investments focusing on areas identified for refugee return, heavily damaged and cut-off areas which have little or no electricity supply, areas with war damage where many connections are of a temporary nature and power supply is unreliable and unsafe, and areas with seriously overloaded networks, due to refugee resettlement. The seventh component provides technical assistance and training in support of procurement and implementation of the physical components, among other sub-components."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"BA","sectorcode":"BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,58,39","mjthemecode":"4,7,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090726234258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090726234258","DocDate":"27-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201231709","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201231709","DocURL":"19-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201232011","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201232011","DocURL":"19-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201231910","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201231910","DocURL":"19-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060904004220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060904004220","DocDate":"24-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00101905441453","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00101905441453","DocDate":"20-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00040503165121","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00040503165121","DocDate":"04-FEB-2000"}],"countryname":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}},"facets":{}}
