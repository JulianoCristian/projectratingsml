(A) US$89.8 million of the loan would be allocated to the credit component.  This would cover the foreign exchange costs of subloans and equity investments made by DFCs for investment projects involving increases in, or rationalization of, productive capacity of enterprises, industrial pollution control or technology development, and for technical assistance required to undertake those projects.  (B) The remaining US$0.2 million would be used for capitalizing the front-end fee of the loan. A related program of technical assistance for the staff of BR and the DFCs would be financed by BR with its own resources."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
