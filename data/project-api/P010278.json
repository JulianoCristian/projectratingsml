The project to be implemented over a seven-year period includes:  (i) improvements to the Chatra Main Canal including provisions for improved desilting; (ii) the rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation distribution and drainage works on 16,700 ha; (iii) further minor improvements to the irrigation and drainage system in the Stage I area (9,750 ha), and (iv) the construction of buildings for offices, and staff quarters.  It further involves (v) the provision of equipment and vehicles for O&M, and equipment for the project workshop; (vi) institutional strengthening through technical assistance, training, and studies; and (vii) financial support for the costs of incremental project establishment and maintenance.  One of the important irrigation management improvements will be the extension of the distribution system to reach 4-5 ha blocks.  This feature is expected to:  (i) enable farmers to construct channels to individual fields; (ii) simplify the allocation of water, and (iii) lead to more effective water users' groups."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"NP","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019184417","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019184417","DocDate":"07-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123223308","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123223308","DocURL":"20-NOV-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e368fe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e368fe_1_0","DocDate":"02-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091826","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091826","DocDate":"31-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Nepal"}},"facets":{}}
