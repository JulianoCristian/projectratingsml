This restructuring paper introduces changes in the project and accompanying amendments to the project's legal documents. Specifically this proposal seeks to extend the closing date of the International Development Association (IDA) financing for the above-referenced project by twelve months from the current closing date of December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012 to provide more time for completion of on-going activities especially in ethnic group communities that have been delayed due to factors outside the control of the government and the project implementing agency. The restructuring also includes changes to the financing plan and a minor reallocation of grant proceeds amongst expenditure categories. Rationale for closing date extension. The extension is necessary to provide more time for completion of on-going activities especially in ethnic group communities that have been delayed due to factors outside the control of the government and the project implementing agency."},"country_namecode":"Lao People's Democratic Republic!$!LA","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and
