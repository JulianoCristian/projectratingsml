In addition to linking the Northern with the more developed Central and Southern Regions, the project would promote the maintenance of the main, secondary and district road networks. Specifically, the five-year project would finance the: (i) construction of a two-land bituminous paved road between Jenda and Luwawa Turnoff (32 km), and Mbowe and Ekwendeni (37 km) and improvement of the existing road between Luwawa Turnoff and Mbowe (100 km) to a low gravel standard; (ii) the second phase of the District Road Improvement and Maintenance Program (DRIMP); (iii) consulting services and training; (iv) provision of road maintenance equipment; and (v) facilities in Lilongwe for training semi-skilled MWS personnel. With the project, direct road users would benefit from cost savings in transport costs, which also would be expected to benefit farmers, shippers and consumers in the form of lower freight and passenger rates. The proposed project also would strengthen and expand the Government's road maintenance capacity as well as improve the EPD's transport planning."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925052248","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925052248","DocDate":"31-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04549_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04549_1_0","DocDate":"03-FEB-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912503083","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912503083","DocDate":"31-JAN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902362524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902362524","DocDate":"31-DEC-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
