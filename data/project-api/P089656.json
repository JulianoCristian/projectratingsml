Weak implementation capacity and a smaller-than-anticipated market response have resulted in slow progress towards DO achievement. In recognition of the key role to be played by the public sector in the development of a market for EE, it is proposed that the project be restructured to provide support for the development of Government's National Program for EE in public buildings which is to be implemented using market based mechanisms and to bring to an end its pursuit of an energy service company (ESCO) model. The restructured project will continue to support market-based financing of EE and RE through a dedicated facility."},"country_namecode":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic
