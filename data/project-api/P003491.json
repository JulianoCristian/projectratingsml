The project provides for infrastructure development in a key port in northeastern China, as well as technical assistance and training to strengthen the port's management and improve its operating capabilities and to address intermodal aspects of port operations.  To that end, the proposed project consists of:  (a) construction of two container berths and two general purpose berths capable of conversion to container berths as and when needed, together with the necessary infrastructure such as dredging, reclamation, pavement, roadways, railways, water supply and sewerage systems.  The project also involves (b) provision of the required loading/unloading equipment, navigational aids and some harbor operation equipment and boats; and (c) provision of training and technical assistance for port planning, construction supervision, financial management, and preparation of two studies:  one for updating the port's Master Plan and the other for intermodal distribution containers in the hinterland of Dalian."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u5927\u8fde\u6e2f\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u534f\u52a9\u5927\u8fde\u5e02\u653f\u5e9c\u52aa\u529b\u7f13\u89e3\u6e2f\u53e3\u62e5\u5835\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u6e2f\u53e3\u541e\u5410\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u4e3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1c\u5317\u5730\u533a\u4e3b\u8981\u6e2f\u53e3\u5927\u8fde\u6e2f\u5efa\u8bbe\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5411\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u6280\u672f\u63f4\u52a9\u548c\u57f9\u8bad\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u52a0\u5f3a\u6e2f\u53e3\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6e2f\u53e3\u8fd0\u8425\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u6e2f\u53e3\u591a\u5f0f\u8054\u8fd0\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u5b89\u6392\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5185\u5bb9\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5efa\u8bbe\u4e24\u4e2a\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\u6cca\u4f4d\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u9020\u4e3a\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\u6cca\u4f4d\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u6cca\u4f4d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u8bbe\u5fc5\u8981\u914d\u5957\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5982\u758f\u6d5a\u3001\u5f00\u57a6\u548c\u8def\u9762\u8bbe\u65bd\u4ee5\u53ca\u516c\u8def\u3001\u94c1\u8def\u3001\u4f9b\u6c34\u548c\u6c61\u6c34\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u6240\u9700\u88c5\u5378\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u8bbe\u5907\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e9b\u6e2f\u53e3\u8fd0\u8425\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u8239\u53ea\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5c31\u6e2f\u53e3\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u65bd\u5de5\u76d1\u7406\u3001\u8d22\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4e24\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u51c6\u5907\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u6280\u672f\u63f4\u52a9\u3002\u4e24\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u5927\u8fde\u6e2f\u603b\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\u66f4\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5927\u8fde\u8179\u5730\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\u591a\u5f0f\u8054\u8fd0\u7814\u7a76\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"96,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007203008","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007203008","DocDate":"09-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99b3f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99b3f_1_0","DocDate":"09-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99b3d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99b3d_1_0","DocDate":"09-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e08244_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08244_1_0","DocDate":"09-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e08242_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08242_1_0","DocDate":"09-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08241_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08241_1_0","DocDate":"09-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926052534","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926052534","DocDate":"05-JAN-1988"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
