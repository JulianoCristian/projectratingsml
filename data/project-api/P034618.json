The objectives of this four-year pilot project are to: 1) support policy and legal reforms to facilitate the development of functioning labor markets and promote urban labor mobility; 2) improve the delivery of labor market services, and training to facilitate the redeployment of, surplus workers in SOEs, the unemployed, and rural-to-urban migrant labor and thus increase labor productivity and mobility; and 3) enhance the institutional capacity of project implementing agencies with a view to promoting market-based services. The components of the project are: 1) policy reform on the coverage and pooling of social insurance at the municipal level, reduction of surplus labor in SOEs, and the monetization of social benefits by employers; 2) employment services on job waiting time, improved administrative and accounting procedures and timely payment of unemployment insurance, and improved labor market information and dissemination; 3) inservice training on placement rates and earnings; and 4) institutional development on improved services to job seekers and employers, and improved resource allocation for training based on market signals."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
