The proposed project entails the construction of about 106 new deep tubewells and the corresponding irrigation and drainage systems. These new tubewells together with 25 existing wells would be electrified by a separate distribution system to be constructed under the project. The project would provide for agricultural support including extension, applied research, fertilizers and chemicals. The project will also make provision for technical assistance and training. It would also assist GOB's efforts to diversify crop production while increasing the value of non-paddy cash crops."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar!$!MM","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"14,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MM","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925163407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925163407","DocDate":"29-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05d64_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05d64_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902422266","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902422266","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901015192","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901015192","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar"}},"facets":{}}
