The project consists of two components: 1) the investment component will address activities related to the regional solid waste management solution, through a treatment of the existing disposal sites for final closure, with the exception of the Skede site, where the LFG will be collected, to be used for electricity generation. A solid waste management system will be established, to meet international sanitary landfill standards, in accordance with the European Union requirements, and, energy cells will be installed for improved degradation of biodegradable waste, and accelerated production of LFG. Resulting greenhouse gas emission reductions will be partly sold to the Prototype Carbon Fund. Energy conversion units will be installed at Grobina, and Skede to run LFG, and both will be connected to the power grid, whose power will be sold to Latvenergo. Technical, and managerial support will be provided to the new waste management company to be established; and, 2) the technical assistance component, will provide training, and capacity building for waste management utilities, municipal authorities, and private sector companies involved in the solid waste management strategy."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Latvia!$!LV","sector1":{"Name":"Solid waste management","Percent":88},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":6},"sector3":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"2,220,000","sector":[{"Name":"Solid waste management"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other industry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"LV","sectorcode":"YW,BH,WB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"81,25,84,73","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"9,11,2,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Solid waste management","code":"WB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":88},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20080501145721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20080501145721","DocDate":"21-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201540434","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201540434","DocURL":"19-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201540837","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201540837","DocURL":"19-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201540132","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201540132","DocURL":"19-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201540233","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201540233","DocURL":"19-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201540535","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201540535","DocURL":"19-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201540736","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201540736","DocURL":"19-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0009200530211","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0009200530211","DocDate":"13-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00082605463053","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082605463053","DocDate":"18-AUG-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Latvia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
