The project strengthens the reform program on several fronts: 1) promotes greater competition and faster integration with the world economy. The credit supports actions aimed at gaining accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), measures to accelerate the divestiture of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in non-strategic sectors, adoption of a more determined approach to banking reform, and introduction of regulatory bodies for infrastructure services. 2) The project also promotes human development and environmental protection. It supports improvements in the quality of education, especially in poor areas, and, also endorses measures aimed at protecting and developing forests, which sustain the livelihoods of many poor households. Moreover, it includes the adoption of a better regulatory framework in relation to the environment. 3) The introduction of modern planning methods, focused on attaining development outcomes, is also supported, in addition to other measures aimed at enhancing transparency and improving governance, i.e., increased disclosure for all state budget entities, strengthened accountability through the independence of the State Audit, and improved information systems. While risks exist, the government is taking steps towards more effective anti-corruption policies, and, rapidly emerging and fast-growing provincial investment funds could contribute to the development of infrastructure at the local level, despite their limited transparency and accountability, which remains a matter of concern."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"JA,EZ,AZ,FZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"45,43,27,40,65","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,4,2,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070718121145","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070718121145","DocDate":"29-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2006012611074259","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006012611074259","DocURL":"15-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2006012611074259","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006012611074259","DocDate":"15-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050607092000","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050607092000","DocDate":"23-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050711100909","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050711100909","DocDate":"12-MAY-2005"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
