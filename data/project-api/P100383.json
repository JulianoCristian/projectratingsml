The restructuring serves to align the project with the evolving priorities of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality for International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) investment financing within the framework of the national investment budget approved by the Turkish State Planning Organization (SPO). The restructuring will: (a) expand the scope of component A - improvements in solid waste management and rehabilitation and clean up of creeks; (b) remove retrofitting and construction of buildings, fire stations and emergency housing associated with urban transformation from component C; and (c) extend the project closing date until June 30, 2013.
