The grant of Trust Fund (TF) for the amount of $27,750,000 was approved by the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) Management Committee on May 19, 2008, and became effective on July 15, 2008. The project was originally a two-year operation. At approval, the closing date of the project was set as December 30, 2009 to align with the closing date of the parent ARTF of June 30, 2010. There was at that time a clear understanding that upon the extension of the closing date of the overall ARTF, the closing date of TF would likewise be extended to enable project implementation over a two year period. The restructuring paper seeks the Country Director's approval to extend the closing date for high priority contracts only, for the ARTF financing for the above referenced project by five months and 30 days from the current closing date of June 30, 2011 to December 30, 2011. December 30, 2011 has been chosen as it is the last business day of the month. The purpose of the extension is to: (i) provide more time for completion of on-going and anticipated contracts, full implementation of which have been delayed because of mostly external factors; and (ii) sustain the implementation of continuing activities, implementation of which will continue under the second phase of the Justice Sector Reform Project (JSRP). The restructuring paper also seeks to cancel some of the outstanding balance of the grant in line with the rationale for extending only high priority contracts."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"27,750,000","sector":[{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report","countrycode":"AF","sectorcode":"BG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Rule of law"],"themecode":"34,32","mjthemecode":"3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20120727021433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120727021433","DocDate":"28-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000386194_20110629005345","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110629005345","DocDate":"28-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000386194_20110629005010","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110629005010","DocDate":"27-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011062623351748","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011062623351748","DocDate":"26-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010112311104344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010112311104344","DocDate":"23-NOV-2010"}],"countryname":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan"}},"facets":{}}
