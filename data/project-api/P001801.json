The project has three main components. First, policy development through strengthening capacity for monitoring of poverty and household food security status and strategies and policy analysis within a recently-established Poverty Alleviation Unit of the National Planning Commission. Second, awareness-creation and in-service training through: (a) support for two national food security conferences, a series of workshops and high-level policy seminars to create widespread awareness and debate of food security issues; (b) intensive short-term training courses for managerial/technical central and provincial staff in analysis of food security issues and appropriate responses -- including concepts/methods, marketing, production, planning/management, macroeconomic aspects and household access -- to be offered through Centro de Formacao Agrario (CFA) in Maputo; (c) development of training modules on food security topics for inclusion in training courses for district and provincial staff at CFA's provincial centers to be offered as part of ongoing rural development programs; and (d) curriculum development, pedagogical materials, textbooks and staff development for the inclusion of food security/nutrition-related courses at training institutes in health.
