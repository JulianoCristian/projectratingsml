The Centers would be the first stage in a long-term program conceived by the Greek Government to make its education system a more effective instrument for economic development. The project would introduce into Greece the multi-discipline, post-secondary institution which combines the requirements for instruction in a variety of study programs, and thereby achieves economies of scale and more efficient use of specialized teachers, equipment and facilities. They will produce trained personnel capable of performing sub-professional duties in a wide variety of occupations in agriculture, business, engineering, food processing and health. The number of departments corresponding to these fields which would be established in each center, and the variety of specialized options to be offered within each department, take into account the specific regional and national requirements. The Centers will have a combined enrollment of 6,660 students and about 2,350 technicians will graduate annually."},"country_namecode":"Hellenic Republic!$!GR","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"13,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GR","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a601_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a601_1_0","DocDate":"03-NOV-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903174588","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903174588","DocDate":"31-OCT-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903204778","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903204778","DocDate":"31-OCT-1970"}],"countryname":"Hellenic Republic"}},"facets":{}}
