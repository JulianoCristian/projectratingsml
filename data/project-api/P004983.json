The project would provide tile drainage for about 950,000 feddans. The proposed credit would cover the total foreign exchange costs of US$26 million. The principal elements of the project would be: the installation of tile drains by mechanized means; the remodeling of open drains and structures to discharge the greater drainage flows; the construction of eleven pump stations; the construction of workshops and procurement of transport for supporting services; and the employment of consultants to advise and assist the project authority."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"26,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Working Paper,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912591990","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912591990","DocDate":"21-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Working Paper (WP),  Vol.1","DocType":"WP","EntityID":"000333037_20090505055329","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090505055329","DocDate":"01-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da5704_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da5704_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAR-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903163262","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903163262","DocDate":"30-NOV-1969"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
