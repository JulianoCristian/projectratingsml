The project consists of four components: 1) strengthening the Department of Protected Areas and Wildlife (DAPVS) and local capacity for protected area management; 2) managing globally important protected areas (PA); 3) improving natural resource management in buffer zones; and 4) biological monitoring. The first component: a) strengthens DAPVS at the national level, primarily at the field office and protected area levels; b) builds local capacity for PA management through training and workshops for nongovernmental organizations, local government, and both members of the regional and local protected areas management committees; and c) coordinates support for project implementation. The second component finances: a) management plans for the globally important protected areas; b) demarcation of core and buffer zones; c) construction of a visitor's center in the Atlantic zone; d) personnel recruitment; and e) construction of park guard facilities. The third component finances buffer zone investments previously identified; and the fourth finances: a) computer and software installation in four regional offices and at headquarters; b) purchase and interpretation of satellite images generating a baseline and comparative analyses of the protected area; c) overflights and four field visits to the project area; d) collection and analysis of data derived from on-the ground surveillance by park guards and others; and e) two annual workshops on monitoring."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"7,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,GEF Project Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"BH,BC,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"83,82,80,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":67},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20060120153646","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060120153646","DocDate":"20-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042814164364","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042814164364","DocDate":"14-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052416254665","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052416254665","DocDate":"19-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"GEF Project Document (PD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PD","EntityID":"000009265_3980203115250","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980203115250","DocDate":"30-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171121","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171121","DocDate":"11-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
