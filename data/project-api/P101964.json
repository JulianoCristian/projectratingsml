The changes are to: i) include the revised results matrix with revised/reformulated project indicators and targets; and ii) extend the closing date from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013. The revision of some of the project indicators is to ensure that the performance of project interventions is properly captured by relevant and available data sources. Currently, actual disbursements stand at US$ 3.28 million. However, adding the disbursed amount as of the end of 2010 and the contracted amount by end of 2011, the total of disbursements and commitments as of end-December 2011 is projected to be US$7.28 million, amounting to 66 percent of the loan amount of US$11 million. The remaining uncommitted amount for the extension period up to June 2013 would be about US$3.72 million or 34 percent of the loan amount. The team is satisfied with the performance of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) procurement system and is confident that it will be able to complete the remaining packages as enumerated in the revised procurement plan projected to June 2013. The project components remain as they were: a) tax compliance; b) tax enforcement and control; c) human resource development and management; and d) BIR management, change management and project management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service
