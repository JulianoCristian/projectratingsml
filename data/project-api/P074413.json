The problem of unsustainable groundwater extraction has been caused by the rapid spread of groundwater irrigation, combined with dwindling rates of recharge. The root cause is a weak management framework ill-adapted to ensuring sustainable extraction levels, efficient water use, and watershed protection. The project has the following three components. Component 1) will provide for the supply and installation of buried PVC and overground galvanized iron (GI) pipes to improve water conveyance and distribution efficiency. It would also provide localized on-farm irrigation systems (drip, bubbler or sprinkler) for a part of the project area to further reduce on-farm water losses. Specifically, this component would involve: (a) improving irrigation conveyance efficiency on about 27,000 ha through the supply and installation of groundwater conveyance pipes; and (b) modernization and improvement of localized on-farm irrigation efficiency. Component 2) will provide gabion baskets and other materials for the selective improvement of traditional small and medium spate schemes within identified wadis to improve spate conveyance, diversion efficiency, and groundwater recharge, in addition to associated wadi bank protection for villages. I t would also involve rehabilitation of terraces to conserve soils from water erosion and water harvesting structures, and divert run-off water for irrigation and recharge the groundwater. This would specifically involve: (a) Small and medium-scale spate irrigation improvement and rehabilitation in the wadis, and (b) Improvement of water harvesting and soil conservation works in the uplands. Component 3) will provide project implementation support, monitoring and evaluation activities, and institutional and ca"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and
