The project design allows flexibility to introduce changes based on implementation experience and increasing farmer participation.  The project will reclaim about 45,000 ha over a seven year period in ten districts.  Out of this, about 39,000 ha will be devoted to production systems based on rice and wheat cropping, and 3,000 ha devoted to salt tolerant horticultural crops.  A further 3,000 ha will be reclaimed on community land and devoted to tree cultivation for fuel and fodder. The key components of the project include:  (i) land reclamation through provision of effective drainage networks; on-farm development; application of chemical amendments; irrigation development; and support for the establishment of food and tree crops on privately owned land, and forest tree species on community land; (ii) institutional development comprising strengthening of (a) The Uttar Pradesh Land Development Corporation (LDC), the main implementing agency; (b) the Remote Sensing Application Center responsible for site identification and selection in the planning process and for monitoring and reclamation induced evaluation of changes to soil and ground water environments; and (c) participating nongovernmental organizations through training to assist beneficiary participation; (iii) agricultural development and technology dissemination consisting of demonstrations of reclamation models for the production of crops, fruit trees and forestry species on sodic lands; nursery development for fruit tree seedlings production; and extension support involving motivational campaigns, production of publicity material, use of mass communication techniques; and (iv) reclamation technology development and special studies comprising adaptive research to improve ex"},"country_namecode":"Republic of
