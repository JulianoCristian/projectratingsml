The project consists of four components: 1) quick-disbursing assistance to finance a positive list of imports; 2) safety net interventions aimed at improving access to food and services by vulnerable groups; 3) distribution of agricultural inputs and technologies to help farmers restart agriculture; and 4) strengthening government's early warning system and capacity for disaster mitigation and management. Benefits include reducing the hardship caused by the food emergency, while helping to maintain investments in health, education, and rural infrastructure. The project will enhance the capacity of vulnerable groups to access goods and services by providing temporary employment and income supplements through public works and other targeted interventions. Risks derive from limitations in the capacity of the government to handle complex issues related to the logistics and distribution of food and other critical supplies to vulnerable people."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":11},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Technical Annex","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"BC,JA,EZ,JB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Human development","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"52,68,78,51,54","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,6,10,8,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":28},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000020953_20070822094931","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070822094931","DocDate":"24-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000011823_20060221121618","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000011823_20060221121618","DocDate":"31-JAN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202122926","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202122926","DocURL":"22-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02091205205293","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02091205205293","DocDate":"04-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_02110204012363","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02110204012363","DocDate":"28-OCT-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
