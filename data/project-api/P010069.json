This is important in reducing transport costs on existing roads and maintaining standards of roads to be taken over from bilateral aid agencies which are financing and constructing major portions of the highway network. A substantially increased allocation of funds by the Government will be required. The project also provides for the replacement of five narrow and unsafe road bridges on existing roads and the supply and erection of five suspension bridges for porter traffic in the hills, to facilitate communications in remote parts of the country."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"2,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NP","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912393227","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912393227","DocDate":"07-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da575f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da575f_1_0","DocDate":"10-NOV-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903174791","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903174791","DocDate":"31-OCT-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903322634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903322634","DocDate":"31-OCT-1970"}],"countryname":"Nepal"}},"facets":{}}
