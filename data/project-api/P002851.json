To this end, the project aims to introduce the main elements of the T & V system including;  (a) systematic visits to groups of farmers; (b) regular training of extension staff; (c) improved linkages between extension and research; (d) proper monitoring and evaluation; and (e) efficient financial management systems at both national and regional levels.  The project also seeks to provide technical assistance to the Ministere du Developpement Rural (MDR) to help in establishing the management systems and procedures for continuously upgrading technical messages.  In addition, as the technology to be transferred will focus on simple, low risk changes in agricultural methods, the project will have direct benefits for the poorer segments of the population as well as for the better off."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Togo!$!TG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TG","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029221056","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029221056","DocDate":"31-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120292969","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120292969","DocURL":"31-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120292969","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120292969","DocDate":"31-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e368eb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e368eb_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091715","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091715","DocDate":"30-APR-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Togo"}},"facets":{}}
