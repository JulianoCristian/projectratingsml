It would introduce into each project area an integated fisheries production, extension and marketing system operating on a fully commercial basis. The credit would provide equipment, vehicles, and support facilities, including 14 feed mills, 4 cold storage plants, 4 overwintering facilities, a hatchery, a vaccine factory and, 7 trade centers. Also the project would strengthen fisheries research and extension services through the provision of technical assistance and training and the construction and/or equipping of eight technical service centers.
