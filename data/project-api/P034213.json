There are three project components. The first develops cadastre by supporting aerial photography, base map development, cadastral surveys, and a Land Information System; by strengthening national and local cadastre offices; and by supporting the Cadastre Implementation Group that manages the cadastre component. The second component establishes and operates a land book system, trains staff, and provides institutional support for local land book offices and the land book implementation group. The third component provides institutional strengthening by supporting the project coordination unit; providing technical assistance to guide implementation and enhance planning and management capacity of the project agencies; and information system design and development and assistance in carrying out cost recovery studies."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":54},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":46},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"25,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83","mjthemecode":"11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":54},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":46}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333038_20080731004235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080731004235","DocDate":"18-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070124122540","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070124122540","DocDate":"19-DEC-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200345335","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200345335","DocURL":"23-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200345536","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200345536","DocURL":"23-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000178830_98101912204244","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912204244","DocDate":"10-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185626","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185626","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052714405798","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052714405798","DocDate":"15-FEB-1994"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
