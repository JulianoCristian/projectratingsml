Due to significant demand, limited budgetary resources and high prices, most public health facilities have had little or no drugs in recent years. The project entails four main strategies which correspond to those of the national policy and address the major issues in the subsector. The strategies involve: (a) developing an affordable and sustainable supply of safe drugs, (b) improving the skills of health workers in providing drugs, (c) changing the harmful practices of beneficiaries, and (d) strengthening institutional capacities to undertake essential drugs programs (EDPs)."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"68,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"JB,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"67,62,25","mjthemecode":"2,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927044638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927044638","DocDate":"10-AUG-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927044752","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927044752","DocDate":"10-AUG-1989"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
