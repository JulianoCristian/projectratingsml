The project components to achieve these objective are: (1) financing a Competitive Grants System for agricultural research, development, and technology transfer; (2) strengthening research management through technical assistance, training, satellite communications, and international collaborations at the Federal level; (3) strengthening research and technology transfer activities at the state level; (4) and monitoring and evaluating the project overall."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BH,BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,79,26","mjthemecode":"2,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":60},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20090818025823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090818025823","DocDate":"30-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20060726135346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060726135346","DocDate":"29-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200305874","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200305874","DocDate":"29-AUG-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200305874","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200305874","DocURL":"29-AUG-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200305673","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200305673","DocURL":"29-AUG-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200305673","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200305673","DocDate":"29-AUG-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101800","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101800","DocDate":"05-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
