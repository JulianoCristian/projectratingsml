The additional loan would help finance the costs associated with a large scaling up of the flood control subcomponent of component 1 titled: Rehabilitation and Improvement of Drainage and Flood Control Infrastructure. The serious floods of 2005, followed by the more severe ones of 2006, have made it clear that additional resources are required quickly in the water resource sector in general, and the flood defense sub sector in particular, given the weaknesses of the inherited infrastructure and the apparently mounting severity of the problems. The additional financing will allow the Government of Serbia and the World Bank to significantly scale up the results expected from the original Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation Project (IDRP), by expanding o f flood control works and expanding of institutional changes to restitute the old water boards which became the present water companies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
