Specifically, it  (i) supports the implementation of a private enterprise tax regime that stimulates investments through leveling the playing field and lowering taxes, and allocates user fees for private sector promotion purposes (ii) restructures the edible oil sector by improving the competitive environment in which it operates, that is, through eliminating or reducing policy distortions associated with non-tariff barriers and other domestic protection mechanisms, and public interventions; (iii) reforming postal services by introducing greater competition, restructuring the postal enterprise so as to enhance its sustainability, and creating an autonomous financial subsidiary that would provide savings, and payment and transfer services; and (iv) changing the pension system to make it financially sustainable and improving its corporate governance. The last two reforms entail substantial financial restructuring, involving clearance of arrears, that would need to be financed by the public budget. In the same vein, the proposed tax reforms may entail revenue shortfalls in the short term. The Credit aims to provide budget resources through counterpart funds generated by balance of payment support it provides, and thus help ensure that social and poverty alleviation programs are not disrupted.  The first tranche of the proposed four-tranche operation would help initiate these reforms. The other three floating tranches would support specific reforms in each of the above areas, except in the edible oil sector, which will be fully covered by the first tranche.  A possible risk includes  imperfect implementation of the reforms, which would undermine their sustainabilit"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and
