The restructuring is required due to the modification of the second phase of the component 1 A: technical investigations since the originally envisaged second phase investigation method of three dimensional seismic survey will not yield reliable results for the geothermal site. Specifically, the geothermal and geology experts concluded that geological specifics of the Karkar geothermal site will not allow getting accurate results from the three-dimensional seismic survey. Instead, the three-dimensional magnetotelluric sounding is proposed for the above geothermal site. The change of the investigation method is based on the results of the phase one site investigation works, the field scouting, the magneto-telluric sounding as well as the independent interpretation of the findings of magneto-telluric sounding."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Armenia!$!AM","sector1":{"Name":"Other Renewable Energy","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Climate
