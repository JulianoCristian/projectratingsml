Other objectives of the project include: increasing the project area's contribution to the local and state food supplies and to export earnings, and improving the technical and administrative capacities of agencies involved in agriculture and rural development in Sergipe State. To achieve these ends, the project provides for the strengthening of agricultural and social support services and infrastructure, rural credit, the establishment of agricultural settlements, and the institutional development of the main local executing agencies. The main risk faced by the project is that of not achieving active participation by and adequate coordination among, the various participating agencies. However, a special Project Administration Unit is already established, and arrangements would be made by the State to ensure a more direct involvement of the participating agencies in annual project planning. Potential project management problems would also be reduced by such safeguards as annual reviews of the implementation program of each participating agency."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"26,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924214158","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924214158","DocDate":"20-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e4e2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e4e2_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e4e0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e4e0_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902330743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902330743","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
