Cashew plantations would include new planting on 53,775 ha and improvements of existing plantation on 7,500 ha. About 30,500 ha of new planting and 4,500 ha of improvements would be carried out by smallholder farmers, and 23,275 ha of new planting and 3,000 ha of improvements by State Corporations. The project would also strengthen cashew development units in each State, strengthen State Corporations, and implement a program of research and training and a cashew industry study. Project risks include the possible lack of coordination among the numerous agencies involved in implementation, and a possible lack of adequate response from the farmers for the proposed long-gestation investments. Measures have been included to coordinate, monitor and expedite all phases of implementation, and necessary services and incentives would be provided to farmers. The risks are, therefore, no greater than normally found in this kind of project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"22,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925182406","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925182406","DocDate":"28-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902350584","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902350584","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e041ae_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e041ae_1_0","DocDate":"29-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e041ab_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e041ab_1_0","DocDate":"29-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228cb1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228cb1_1_0","DocDate":"29-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
