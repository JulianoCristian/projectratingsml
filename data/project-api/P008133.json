In addition, the project would promote increased efficiency in agricultural lending and in the provision of technical assistance. The project includes 1) a general line of credit to finance agricultural and agro industrial investments, as well as complementary permanent working capital; and 2) institutional support for farm extension, forestry, and promotion of non traditional exports. Project benefits include: 1) increased volume of agricultural exports, 2) creation of closer links between the private & public sectors in export promotion, 3) development of forestry resources for the subsequent establishment of forest based industry, 4) improved efficiency of farm extension and 5) a more competitive and market oriented system for supplying investment credit to agriculture.
