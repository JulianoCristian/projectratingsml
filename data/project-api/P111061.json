Based on the revised procurement plan, the project management team is actively processing the various activities identified in the plan. The closing date of the project was June 30, 2011. However the implementation of the project faced delays due to number of factors of which the major ones are: a) delays in signing and mobilization of the technical assistance for the project management team; b) the prevailing conditions in the country in relation to preparation for and carrying out of the national referendum which took place in January, 2011; and c) the rebidding of the major work contracts that was necessitated following a necessary repackaging to attract more competition from contractors. The Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Southern Sudan which was originally going too closed on June 30, 2011, has now been extended by the oversight committee to June 30, 2012."},"country_namecode":"Republic
