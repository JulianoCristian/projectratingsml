The economic return on the maintenance item is estimated at about 36percent over the six-year expected life of the capital investment. The betterment program will ensure all-weather transport on two roads serving the most agriculturally productive and densely populated areas of the country. This project item yields an economic return of about 35percent on the Boghe-Kaedi-Kiffa road in the south, and of about 16percent on the Akjoujt-Atar-Choum road in the north. The pre-investment studies concern improvement of the most heavily trafficked unpaved road in the country.  The project will consist of the following: (a) technical assistance to the Ministry of Equipment; (b) purchase of highway equipment for maintenance and betterment works; (c) continuation of a betterment program on about 365 km of roads; and (d) feasibility study and detailed engineering for construction of the Rosso-Boghe road (200 km), the most heavily trafficked unpaved road in the country."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania!$!MR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"3,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MR","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901031544","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901031544","DocDate":"16-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dec90d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dec90d_1_0","DocDate":"12-NOV-1974"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902231589","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902231589","DocDate":"31-OCT-1974"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100208013548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100208013548","DocDate":"30-OCT-1974"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania"}},"facets":{}}
