About half of this area is at present served by an irrigation system, which, however, supplies water for a single crop of paddy; the rest of the acreage is entirely dependent on the monsoon. The project is designed, on full development, to produce an increase in net farm benefits amounting to US$30 million per year. The rate of return to the economy is estimated to be 10 percent per annum. The increased output will also reduce the amount of paddy that will otherwise have to be imported to meet the needs of a growing population and a rising standard of living; the gross annual import savings may be of the order of US$35 million."},"country_namecode":"Malaysia!$!MY","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MY","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902513027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902513027","DocDate":"30-NOV-1965"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e678f4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e678f4_1_0","DocDate":"17-NOV-1965"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903482478","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903482478","DocDate":"31-OCT-1965"}],"countryname":"Malaysia"}},"facets":{}}
