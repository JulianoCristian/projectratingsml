This program complements other interventions in education, rural productivity, ans water and sanitation, described in the equity pillar of the Bolivia Country Assistance Strategy. There are two main components other than that for project coordination and performance agreements. The first increases coverage and quality of health service networks, and empowers communities by strengthening the basic health insurance program with the financing of computers, training, supervision, and external audits as well as issuing protocols for basic health interventions and implementing a systen for supervising the quality of basic health insurance activities; and providing information, education, and communication activities for indigenous peoples, pregnant women, and health advocates. This component also supports national programs for mothers and children by expanding immunization programs and quality improvements in basic health insurance programs. The second component strengthens local capacity to respond to health needs by expanding the coverage of the basic health insurance program and financing investment sub-projects that strengthen primary-level services, develop community outreach programs, and prevent and treat communicable diseases."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de reforma del sector de salud - Segunda fase</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":81},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":11},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"JB,BH,BC,BK,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"60,63,57,69,67","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":81},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090309235620","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090309235620","DocDate":"27-JAN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201234629","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201234629","DocURL":"31-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01062004021846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01062004021846","DocDate":"12-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01083104080648","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01083104080648","DocDate":"11-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01080804095829","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01080804095829","DocDate":"31-MAR-2001"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
