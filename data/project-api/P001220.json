It will provide production and processing facilities for 14,000 acres of tea, increasing the smallholder tea cultivation to a total of 25,500 acres. This project will consist of financing and establishment of nurseries and sale of planting material to smallholders; supervision of smallholder tea cultivation in the field and the training of smallholders through a staff of instructors; operation of buying centers, including collection, inspection, purchase and transport of green leaf to the factories; and organizing and supervising these activities through a small central staff. The project will provide about 15,000 smallholders with a cash income, raising them from subsistence economy to a better standard of living, thus contributing to the political stability of the country."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"2,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20081127024159","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20081127024159","DocDate":"05-MAR-1974"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081df5580_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081df5580_1_0","DocDate":"17-AUG-1964"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902451450","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902451450","DocDate":"31-JUL-1964"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903474813","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903474813","DocDate":"31-JUL-1964"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
