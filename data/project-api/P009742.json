The project helps NCDC and State Cooperative Banks to introduce a more disciplined, project-oriented approach to financing basic facilities for village cooperative societies, regional marketing cooperatives and state-level cooperative federations. Investments comprise construction of godowns for these cooperative institutions. Technical assistance, vehicles and engineering instruments are also financed. The project godowns would result in increased availability of inputs, particularly fertilizer, at the village level with consequent agricultural production increases."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190232003","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190232003","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912414292","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912414292","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd035_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd035_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c47_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c47_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
