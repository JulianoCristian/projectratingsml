The project would be the first significant step by the Government designed to contribute to fulfilling unsatisfied domestic demand for fresh meat which has hitherto been suppressed due to the need to earn scarce foreign exchange. Annual incremental poultry meat production resulting from the project would reach 157,000 tons (liveweight) at full development in 1987. The project is also expected to create about 9,000 new jobs. The main risk confronting the project is that the projected efficiency improvement in poultry industry may not be attained unless the feed conversion ratio and the managerial and technical quality of the local staff improve as planned and sufficient specialized quality and health control equipment is provided."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"85,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924221830","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924221830","DocDate":"14-OCT-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902334527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902334527","DocDate":"31-OCT-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e958a2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958a2_1_0","DocDate":"30-OCT-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e958a1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958a1_1_0","DocDate":"30-OCT-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912464690","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912464690","DocDate":"30-SEP-1979"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
