To support these objectives, the components will: 1) provide technical assistance (TA) to the Bureau d'Electrification Rurale Decentralisee (BERD) in the monitoring, evaluation, and dissemination of activities. Private providers will be assisted in identifying, and setting of electricity delivery services in rural areas, under concession arrangements, while training will be provided in the installation, and maintenance of equipment. Village organizations will be encouraged to organize service delivery; 2) finance implementation mechanisms for the decentralized rural electrification program, through the creation of a fund for long-term credit, and up-front costs of rural electrification systems (e.g., renewable energy systems). The Fund resources will come from the general budget, bilateral and multilateral donors, and at a later date, from privatization of the power sector. Funds will cover operational costs, and provision of loans, and grants to promoters of renewable energy; and, 3) support project management, to strengthen the operational capacity of BERD, coordinate, supervise, and monitor project implementation, through the provision of qualified staff, personnel training, and equipment supply as needed."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"Other Renewable Energy","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other Renewable Energy"},{"Name":"General finance sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"FZ,LR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0002422464","geoLocName":"Capitale d'Etat-Zone Speciale de Conakry","latitude":"9.6070299","longitude":"-13.597","country":"GN"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"84,81,78","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"10,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other Renewable Energy","code":"LR"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":70},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20140408103855","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20140408103855","DocDate":"28-MAR-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081c3ed86_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3ed86_1_0","DocDate":"08-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081761848_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081761848_1_0","DocDate":"10-NOV-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012040608561669","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012040608561669","DocDate":"06-APR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011072921105751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011072921105751","DocDate":"29-JUL-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201313778","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201313778","DocURL":"08-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201313980","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201313980","DocURL":"08-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02061404074639","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02061404074639","DocDate":"22-APR-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
