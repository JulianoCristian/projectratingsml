The components include: 1) expansion of the highway capacity, through partial construction of the National Trunk Highway System, connecting the Shuiren, and Nanning provinces, as well as those roads connecting into the corridor; 2) maintenance and rehabilitation of the highway system is included, particularly for those rural roads, in relatively poor areas; 3) highway safety will be improved, through the upgrade of the most dangerous road sections in sub-urban areas of the Nanning, and Wuming provinces, and other selected road segments; and, 4) the Guangxi Communications Department's capacity will be strengthened, through support, and training on project planning, design, construction, and supervision. Further support is included for project management, and monitoring of environmental, and resettlement plans."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
