The amendment of the financing agreement is to add a new activity under schedule one, project description, namely rural finance. In light of the multiple sources of funding, this particular change (not category reallocation) is necessary to allow for resources currently earmarked only for investments in on-farm irrigation equipment under the drought adaptation component, sub-component one to be used for financing of other types of investments that are eligible under the rural finance component. The extension of the concessionary terms that are currently applicable to irrigation sub-loans (20 percent grant), to loans financing investments in low-till equipment and technology, as requested by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAFI). These terms will help to stimulate the adoption of conservation agricultural practices."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"General finance
