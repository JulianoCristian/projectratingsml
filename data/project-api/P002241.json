The project comprises two main components: (a) strengthening of the institutional regulatory and policy environment; and (b) rehabilitation of key infrastructure in the power subsector. The first component will include: (i) restructuring the Rwandese Utility Company to permit contracting out its operations to a private operator; (ii) consulting services to prepare new statutes and organization chart for the utility and bidding documents for the selection of the private operator, and to assist in implementing its contracting under a lease type contract and in establishing two companies; (iii) implementation of a series of make-ready measures in order to attract qualified private operators; (iv) introduction of incentives to rationalize and improve the efficiency of the charcoal subsector; (v) implementation of environmental and technical guidelines for future development of Lake Kivu's methane gas by private investors; (vi) studies to design and implement a strategy for development of solar home systems as a cost-efficient alternative for electricity in rural areas; and (vii) technical assistance and training to strengthen the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Handicrafts's capacity to deal with petroleum products issues. The power subsector component includes: (i) rehabilitation and improvements of key power infrastructure for five cities; (ii) improvement in the medium voltage sections; (iii) overhauls of power station and hydraulic structures; (iv) feasibility studies for hydroplants; (v) constitution of a strategic stock of spare parts for plants and substations; and (vi) capacity building and training
