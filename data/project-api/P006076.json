An Industrial Credit Fund (ICF) will be established in the CBB with separate funds, accounts and staff to provide term financing to industrial and tourism enterprises through financial intermediaries. The project includes technical assistance to the CBB, and possibly, the Barbados National Bank and the Barbados Development Bank. About 100 subloans averaging US$150,000 are expected to be made. Investments partly financed by these subloans are expected to create about 1,000 new jobs, at an estimated average cost of US$15,000 per job."},"country_namecode":"Barbados!$!BB","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BB","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006232808","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006232808","DocDate":"30-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925165734","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925165734","DocDate":"19-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902413776","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902413776","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901020420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901020420","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"}],"countryname":"Barbados"}},"facets":{}}
