The reallocation is necessary to allow Bangladesh Bank (BB) to utilize the unused funds to finance existing components and three new activities not included in the original project. The reallocation of unused funds for the new activities will contribute substantially toward the better achievement of the project development objective (PDO) and PDO output and outcome indicators. There is only a reallocation of funds from an existing component to support three new activities that are nevertheless consistent with Bangladesh Bank's (BB's) priority reform agenda which this project is supporting. The three new activities are: (i) National Payment Switch (NPS) and e-Payment Gateway, (ii) IT System for Anti-Money Laundering Department (AMLD) for Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR) and Cash Transaction Reporting (CTR), and (iii) system for Public Accounts Department (PAD). International Development Association (IDA) has agreed to finance National Payment Switch (NPS) and e-Payment Gateway 100 percent of the expenditure up to a maximum amount of SDR3.8149 million (USD 6.0 million). A separate sub-category under (one) goods will be created for this activity. The three new activities will contribute substantially toward achievement of the PDO and PDO output and outcome indicators."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
