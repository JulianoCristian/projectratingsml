The Government of China gives high priority to electric power development and has developed a comprehensive strategy for power development. The Yanshi Thermal Power Project is located about 90 km west of Zhengzhou in Henan province and comprises the following components: (i) extension of the existing Yanshi thermal power plant by adding two generating units of 300 MW each at a site being developed; (ii) construction of five 220 kV transmission lines with associated substations; (iii) provision of technical assistance for a tariff study for the Henan power grid; and (iv) a training program for upgrading the technical, financial, and management skills of the Henan Provincial Electric Power Bureau (HPEPB) staff."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u5043\u5e08\u706b\u7535\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u53d1\u7535\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u5236\u7ea6\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4e00\u5927\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u91cd\u89c6\u7535\u529b\u884c\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6b64\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5168\u9762\u6218\u7565\u3002\u5043\u5e08\u706b\u7535\u9879\u76ee\u4f4d\u4e8e\u6cb3\u5357\u7701\u90d1\u5dde\u5e02\u4ee5\u897f\u7ea690\u516c\u91cc\u5904\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5185\u5bb9\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4e3a\u5df2\u5efa\u5043\u5e08\u706b\u7535\u5382\u5728\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u5730\u70b9\u65b0\u589e\u4e24\u53f0300\u5146\u74e6\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7ec4\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u67b6\u8bbe\u4e94\u6761220\u5343\u4f0f\u8f93\u7535\u7ebf\u8def\uff0c\u5efa\u8bbe\u914d\u5957\u53d8\u7535\u7ad9\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u6280\u672f\u63f4\u52a9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u5c55\u6cb3\u5357\u7535\u7f51\u7535\u4ef7\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u57f9\u8bad\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6cb3\u5357\u7701\u7535\u529b\u5c40\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3001\u8d22\u52a1\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"180,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39","mjthemecode":"4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121391982","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121391982","DocURL":"07-FEB-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121392183","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121392183","DocURL":"07-FEB-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002052724","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002052724","DocDate":"17-DEC-1991"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
