Attainment of these objectives should contribute to improved health status of rural residents in the project states, and serve as an example of sectoral reform for other low income states and countries. The project's two components are 1) a Health Services Development component to assist in the delivery of a package of three basic health services including a) care for women and children including family planning, b) a program for infectious disease control, c) a program for ambulatory and hospital based medical care and 2) an Institutional Development component to improve a) administration and delivery of basic health services, b) decentralization of a public health network."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":16},"theme4":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"267,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Public sector governance","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,93,26,67,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,2,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980804142718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980804142718","DocDate":"16-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042713092640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042713092640","DocDate":"30-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032416214141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032416214141","DocDate":"26-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926183058","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926183058","DocDate":"27-OCT-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926183001","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926183001","DocDate":"25-OCT-1989"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
