There are four project components. The first rehabilitates and upgrades portions of the Tallinn-Tartu-Luhamaa road and widens the Tartu Ring road and interchange. The second component includes the construction of civil works to eliminate accident black spots and to install road markings for new asphalt pavements, road side delineators, traffic signs, and automatic speed control cameras; creates campaign materials for a road safety campaign; and provides technical assistance, training sessions, and software. The third component provides continued assistance to the national road administration to strengthen its operational capacity and funds training, office, and laboratory equipment. The fourth component 1) facilitates trade by developing an environment with laws and regulations to ensure the development of trade supporting services and infrastructure on an equal and fair basis, taking into account European Union accession; 2) supports creation of an efficient public and private partnership based on combined resources; 3) encourages access to capital on equal terms and conditions; 4) provides quality education, training, and research on trade supporting services; and 5) provides easy Estonian access to global markets and foreign access to the Estonian market."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Estonia!$!EE","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"EE","sectorcode":"BZ,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,78","mjthemecode":"10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050909112130","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050909112130","DocDate":"31-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200455699","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200455699","DocURL":"27-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00040605313841","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00040605313841","DocDate":"23-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911054722","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911054722","DocDate":"12-APR-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Estonia"}},"facets":{}}
