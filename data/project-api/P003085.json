The project includes the following components: (a) developing new water supply systems in 18 semi-rural centers with piped water; (b) reinforcing the water supply of Likasi, an essential element for the development of this mining town; and (c) technical assistance and training aimed at strengthening sector planning for REGIDSCO (Regie de Distribution d'Eau de la Republique du Zaire). It also includes: (d) consulting services; and (e) supply of essential operational and training equipment to further strengthen REGIDESCO's operational and managerial capabilities.
