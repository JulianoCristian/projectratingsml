This objective will be achieved by providing: (1) essential support services necessary to sustain privatized agriculture at the raion and farm levels.  These are: land registration, farm information and advisory services, credit services, and rehabilitation of critical irrigation and drainage infrastructure; (2) an enabling environment which will build linkages between key institutions, viz., the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Land Committee, the State Irrigation Committee, Agrarian Reform Commissions and agricultural banking institutions; and (3) a community based social services and formation of village groups in support of land privatization and farm restructuring.  The project will consist of four components to be implemented over a period of five years.  These are: (1) farm privatization support services at the national level and in the raions; (2) rehabilitation of the main irrigation water supply and drainage works; and (3) a community development program; and (4) project management and implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Azerbaijan!$!AZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"14,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AZ","sectorcode":"JB,BH,AI,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"78,82,57,43,83","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,4,7,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":75},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333038_20080820011126","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080820011126","DocDate":"28-JUL-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040701103332","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040701103332","DocDate":"15-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182531","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182531","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123432665","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123432665","DocURL":"24-FEB-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970311115234","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970311115234","DocDate":"19-DEC-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Azerbaijan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
