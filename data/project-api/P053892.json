There are four project components: 1) Upgrading primary health care network will replace the existing substandard Level II Primary Health Care (PHC) clinics (small community health centers) with PHC clinics of higher quality, which is part of the comprehensive Primary Health Care Rehabilitation Program. 2) The second component will establish a Health Management Information System, establish a health information center (HIC), finance the design and construction of the HIC facility, and support the capacity building of the HIC staff. 3) The third component will address the priority problem areas identified with respect to the quality and efficiency of health care. This include institutionalizing the Quality Improvement process, applying quality standards and procedures in selected priority health areas, drug rationalization, improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of treatment abroad cases, and strengthening MOH's capacity to monitor and evaluate the quality and efficiency of health services. 4) The last component will support the Project Implementation Unit for project coordination and management."},"country_namecode":"West Bank and Gaza!$!GZ","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":84},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"sector3":{"Name":"Non-compulsory health finance","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"7,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory health finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"GZ","sectorcode":"FB,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development"],"themecode":"67,78","mjthemecode":"10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Non-compulsory health finance","code":"FB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":84},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20051028110100","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051028110100","DocDate":"26-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911061342","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911061342","DocDate":"03-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9912020559440","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9912020559440","DocDate":"08-NOV-1999"}],"countryname":"West Bank and Gaza"}},"facets":{}}
