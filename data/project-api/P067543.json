There are five project components. The first component focuses on decentralization and institutional development. The second component strengthens and integrates service delivery, namely financing incremental operating costs, drug delivery, campaigns, and training, activities to target special groups, and service delivery by non-governmental organizations. The third component focuses on disability prevention and finances purchase of services from nongovernmental organizations, consultant services, training, purchase of equipment, and operating expenses. The fourth component is an information, education, and communication component, carrying out political advocacy, and changing society's attitude to leprosy and increasing demand by affected individuals for leprosy control services. It finances consultant services, workshops, training, technical assistance, IEC materials, and media space and operational expenses. Finally, the fifth component reorients staff to an integrated approach and provides them new skills in the general health services, management skills, and technical skills."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BH,BC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,26,59,60,64","mjthemecode":"8,7,7,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":91},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050627121117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050627121117","DocDate":"23-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201192562","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201192562","DocURL":"19-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01040405314560","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01040405314560","DocDate":"27-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01040305303850","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01040305303850","DocDate":"27-OCT-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
