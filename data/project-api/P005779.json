It would bring the benefits of adequate and reliable electricity service to about 17,000 new customers and upgrade the quality of service for another 5,200 existing customers. The major project components include: (a) expansion and connection of the distribution networks in 17 priority villages to nearby existing generating facilities with underutilized capacities; (b) installing relatively small generating units and constructing distribution networks in the towns of Zabid, Hazm Al Jawf and Marib; (c) establishing and reinforcing the distribution networks in the farmers' markets in the main cities of Sanaa, Hodeida and Taiz; (d) construction of a subtransmission line and distribution network in Bani Hushaysh and Mabar whose future connection to the national grid would be economic; (e) technical assistance and training; and (f) consultant services for energy and electricity pricing studies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04552_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04552_1_0","DocDate":"10-FEB-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04550_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04550_1_0","DocDate":"10-FEB-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902364880","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902364880","DocDate":"31-JAN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191251416","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191251416","DocDate":"31-JAN-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
