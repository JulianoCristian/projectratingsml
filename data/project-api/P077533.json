Furthermore, the project will commence the process of helping villages rebuild their capital base through the provision of sub-grants, and empower villagers to plan for, and decide on, the investments to be made with the proceeds of the sub-grants. The grant will finance oversight consultants for both the labor-intensive works, and community grants; rehabilitation of provincial and district roads, and irrigation infrastructure; block grants to villages and neighborhoods; and, vehicles provision. Services will be provided to monitor the program, manage financial flows, record-keeping and audits, and, to carry out evaluation, institutional, impact, and follow-up studies. Needless to say, implementation difficulties due to conditions in the country are risks, that include security problems, lack of legal and regulatory systems, and, a weak and distorted market for skilled labor. However, project benefits - beyond labor opportunities - will far outnumber those risks."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Other social
