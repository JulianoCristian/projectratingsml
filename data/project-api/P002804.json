The project consists of three components.  First, strengthening agricultural research system will bring about more effective and efficient agricultural research institutions, and an effective arrangement for donor coordination and for coordinating regional and other collaborative research programs.  Second, organization and management of agricultural research will provide demand-driven, client oriented research, efforts to introduce participatory techniques, and guidelines for small-farmer oriented and gender-sensitive research.  Third, human resource development will support increased number of research personnel in needed disciplines, and strengthen financial management and information services."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":72},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":28},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"21,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"AB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,79,77","mjthemecode":"10,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":72},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":28}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20041230091943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041230091943","DocDate":"28-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121304108","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121304108","DocURL":"31-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121304108","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121304108","DocDate":"31-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980217140118","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980217140118","DocDate":"25-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184019","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184019","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
