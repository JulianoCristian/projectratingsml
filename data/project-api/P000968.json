The project consists of four components. 1) Reforming and strengthening agricultural technology generation and diffusion as the main thrust of the program will accelerate agricultural growth that results in increased food security, reduced poverty, and conservation of the natural resource base. 2) Institutional reform and strengthening of Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) will integrate resources for implementation of plans and provision of decentralized services under the administration of district assemblies, thus placing the responsibility for planning and implementation of agricultural services and development activities at the grassroots level. 3) Development of farmer-based organizations (FBOs) will develop a grassroots independent movement of FBOs. 4) Strengthening agricultural education and training will strengthen the capacity of agricultural training institutions to produce the middle level human resources/skills critically needed in the sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":63},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
