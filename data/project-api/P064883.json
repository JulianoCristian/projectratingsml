The project would help to alleviate rural poverty, reduce pressures upon and improve management of the natural resources base by: (a) increasing social capital around natural resources management, through support to communities, organizations and local authorities (traditional and municipal) to jointly define and implement a local development vision which takes natural resources management and sustainability objectives into account; (b) increasing opportunities to sustainably improve productivity and diversify farming and other (off-farm) livelihood systems; (c) extending and strengthening ongoing efforts of indigenous communities to establish permanent conservation areas within broader zones of biodiversity of global importance and to maintain the habitats which sustain this diversity; and (d) establishing and piloting a framework for environmental services markets to sustain local incentives for conservation. The proposed project will form a part of the Government's program of interventions in the implementation of the Peace Accords for the Western Altiplano. As some 95% of the population of the proposed project area are Mayan, the proposed project can also be considered an indigenous (Mayan) peoples development project. There are four project components. Component 1 (Sustainable Livelihoods) is oriented toward improving the welfare of the rural poor through promotion of sustainable use and Conservation of natural resources. The component consists of two subcomponents: Subproject Grants and Local Institutional Strengthening. Component 2 (Biodiversity Conservation) will finance activities to strengthen local and national capacity to conserve natural habitats containing g"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guatemala!$!GT","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"32,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Working Paper,Working Paper,Note on Cancelled Operation,Environmental Assessment,Indigenous Peoples Plan,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GT","sectorcode":"AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"60,26,79,80,83","mjthemecode":"11,11,10,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Working Paper (Numbered Series) (NWP),  Vol.1","DocType":"NWP","EntityID":"000456286_20140416151110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20140416151110","DocDate":"01-JUL-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Working Paper (Numbered Series) (NWP),  Vol.1","DocType":"NWP","EntityID":"000456286_20140327125504","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20140327125504","DocDate":"01-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000090341_20050706092500","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050706092500","DocDate":"24-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0309060406464","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0309060406464","DocDate":"31-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000094946_03100304224741","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03100304224741","DocDate":"31-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20030507154030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030507154030","DocDate":"30-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03050804031615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03050804031615","DocDate":"10-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03012804023084","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03012804023084","DocDate":"27-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00110105334312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00110105334312","DocDate":"10-JAN-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guatemala"}},"facets":{}}
