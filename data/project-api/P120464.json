The closing date of the project will be extended from June 30, 2012 until September 28, 2012. The extension will give enough time for the successful completion of ongoing activities and a successful achievement of the development objective. The MOH, which is the implementing entity, has submitted through MOFEP the formal request for extension of the project up to September 28, 2012. The MOH has also submitted the revised plan of action which shows that the planned activities under the project will be completed by September 28, 2012. This will be the second extension of the project for a total of three months."},"country_namecode":"Republic of South Sudan!$!SS","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Public
