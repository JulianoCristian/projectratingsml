This opportunity comes at a time of unusually adverse external environment, which poses grave economic risks. The new government needs to quickly build a record of credibility that will enable Brazil to improve its access to international markets. The proposed Second Programmatic Fiscal Reform Loan for Brazil addresses two of the four broad objectives of the Government's fiscal reform: 1) institutionalization of responsible and credible fiscal policy and risk management; and 2) improvements in efficiency in the revenue structure and further strengthening of the tax administration. Within the context of the first broad objective, the loan will support: a) strengthening of macro-fiscal planning; b) effective control of sub-national debts and sub-national fiscal discipline; c) improvements in fiscal transparency and reporting; d) capacity building in public debt management and its further institutionalization; and e) market development for government securities. With respect to the second broad objective, the loan will support a tax reform to reduce distortionary effects on the national economy"},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"404,040,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Capital markets"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BH,FK,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,27,28,25,21","mjthemecode":"1,2,2,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":75},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040701130906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040701130906","DocDate":"24-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201592054","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201592054","DocURL":"11-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201592054","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201592054","DocDate":"11-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000094946_03052104034124","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052104034124","DocDate":"14-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03050804040123","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03050804040123","DocDate":"23-APR-2003"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
