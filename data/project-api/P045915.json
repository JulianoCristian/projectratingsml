The project has five components. 1) Road Network Development will provide a 31.25 km \"Ring Road\" which will link the old central business district (CBD) to new development areas of the city, protect the CBD from extraneous traffic, and distribute regional traffic to the urban trunk road network. 2) Traffic Management and Road Safety will enhance the efficiency in the use of the existing road space and improve traffic safety. 3) Public Transport will develop public transport as a viable and sustainable travel alternative to the car by improving the level of existing bus services. It will support the ongoing reforms towards the strengthening of the regulatory and planning capabilities of the Urban Construction Commission and support commercial viability of Urumqi Public Transport Company. 4) Environmental Management will support Urumqi's leadership which is very active in promoting and implementing environmental protection and improvement initiatives, and further develop a Motor Vehicle Emission Control Strategy. 5) Institutional Development will strengthen local capacity and processes for urban transport, planning, programming and budgeting, and system management."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
