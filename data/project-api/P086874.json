Performance indicator targets have been updated to reflect the additional funds being made available. The additional grant will help finance the costs associated with scaling up successful activities of a well performing project that has led to substantial increase in access to basic social services. The activities to be funded comprise: (i) rehabilitation and construction of small-scale community based infrastructure; (ii) capacity building primarily for beneficiary communities and local executing agencies involved in project implementation; and (iii) project coordination and management.
