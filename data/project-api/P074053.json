Component B) supports the establishment of a single health insurance fund by means of consolidating the four existing health insurance schemes, and expanding its reach to an additional estimated 22 million citizens who are not fully covered. Component C) has four sub-components: (i) introduction of family medicine as an organizational model for the provision of outpatient or primary health care services; (ii) harmonization of MOH and SSK hospitals towards greater autonomy; (iii) developing an effective patient referral system to reinforce system hierarchy; and (iv) strengthening population health programs, including disease surveillance, maternal and child health, prevention and control of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
