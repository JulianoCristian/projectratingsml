Subject to annual reviews and updatings, the project covers the Government's 1988-1990 total sectoral expenditure program.  The program places particular emphasis on road maintenance, including increased funding and institutional improvements, selective road rehabilitation of national and feeder roads, and upgrading of a limited number of road sections.  The project also includes components for coastal protection, road safety improvements, and an action plan to reduce railway deficits.  Additionally, the project aims to finance technical assistance to improve transport planning, for manpower development and training and for the preparation of a set of policy actions including a study of road user charges to improve road pricing policy."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Togo!$!TG","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TG","sectorcode":"TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,40,30","mjthemecode":"2,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030211253748","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030211253748","DocDate":"29-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08214_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08214_1_0","DocDate":"15-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926134353","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926134353","DocDate":"17-NOV-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Togo"}},"facets":{}}
