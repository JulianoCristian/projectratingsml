Sound macroeconomic policies coupled with limited external imbalances have helped Poland maintain economic growth despite the slowdown and economic uncertainty in Europe since 2008. Notwithstanding these positive developments over the past few years, Poland is not immune to the protracted recession in the Euro area. Poland's economy has performed well during and after the 2008 global financial crisis. Strong macroeconomic fundamentals, including limited macroeconomic imbalances at the onset of the crisis, large and diversified domestic economy, close trade and supply chain linkages to Germany and adequate policy mix prior to and during the crisis, helped the economy withstand external shocks. The growth in government spending was contained by: a) a temporary fiscal rule limiting increases in all newly enacted and existing discretionary expenditure items to one percentage point over the rate of inflation (CPI); and b) a nominal freeze of the budgetary sphere wage bill, and c) phasing out of early retirement schemes."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":29},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":14},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"1,307,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"JB,FA,BH,BE,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance","Economic management","Rule of law","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"55,34,21,27,87","mjthemecode":"6,2,1,3,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":29},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":29},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":14},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b0824b6507_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0824b6507_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081e74696_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e74696_1_0","DocDate":"03-SEP-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081d0503a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081d0503a_1_0","DocDate":"02-JUL-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000356161_20130530104712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130530104712","DocDate":"20-MAY-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20121206173350","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20121206173350","DocDate":"30-OCT-2012"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland"}},"facets":{}}
