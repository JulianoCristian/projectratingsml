The second component strengthens the planning, management, and administrative performance of the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MSAS); decentralizes decisionmaking to districts and health facilities; strengthens coordination of donors and nongovernmental organizations; improves health sector financing; implements effective health information and epidemic surveillance systems; and improves health personnel management. The third mitigates the effects of infant and child mortality, maternal mortality, young child malnutrition, and infectious diseases (while increasing preventive care).
