The components will: 1) improve the operation of the Kerala Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (KRWSA), by promoting a sanitation, and hygiene strategy, and framework, through information, education, and communications development. Capacity building includes development of knowledge, skills, and management practices in technical, institutional, financial, and management aspects. This will be strengthened by financing staff capacity building, and installation/operation of computers, and office equipment; 2) support community development, and infrastructure building, ensuring mobilization, and women's participation in a broad range of activities. Design, and engineering support will address community managed water supply systems, in addition to construction, drainage, and environmental management. The tribal development program will address water scarcity, and capacity building; 3) provide technical assistance (TA) for comprehensive statewide planning, development and management aspects; and, 4) provide TA to the Central Government, to foster sector reforms."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection
