The components call for: 1) supply and installation of decentralized, gas-fired boiler plants with auxiliaries. This will require design, and site management work, as well as mobile maintenance units, and tools to maintain the boiler plants. These plants will be connected to the existing gas network, whose relatively new gas network, has sufficient capacity, to reduce gas consumption in Sevastopol, as well as improve the gas network pressure in Crimea; 2) technical assistance for Sevteploservis financial management, which includes implementation support, social assistance support, and, a tariff study. The component includes training, and equipment, and software supply; and, 3) incremental financial audits, regarding the initial five year implementation period of Sevteploservis."},"country_namecode":"Ukraine!$!UA","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"28,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"UA","sectorcode":"LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,81","mjthemecode":"11,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000160016_20040622092446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040622092446","DocDate":"07-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050416124859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050416124859","DocDate":"23-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041510535158","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041510535158","DocDate":"23-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01030705521350","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01030705521350","DocDate":"26-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903310577","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903310577","DocDate":"14-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0008180616548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0008180616548","DocDate":"31-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Ukraine"}},"facets":{}}
