The proceeds of the grant will be disbursed (i) to support cash flow needs in the period immediately after Liberia has cleared its arrears to IBRD and IDA, and (ii) to meet immediate budgeted fiscal needs including future debt service obligations. The grant would assist the Republic of Liberia in its economic and social recovery underpinned by the government's Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy. This one-tranche operation would support government-owned reforms to improve the country's fiduciary environment and strengthen public institutions.
