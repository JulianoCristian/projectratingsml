The Government has requested for cancellation of US$ 1.5 million from the remaining un-utilized funds in the Maldives Mobile Phone Banking Project. Even though the infrastructure was available, the mobile payment system has not been implemented due to the non-cooperation of the major state bank of the country while the real time gross settlement system is operational and the automated clearing house function is partially operational. As the Project has already incurred the required expenses for setting up the mobile payment infrastructure and enhanced the capacity of the recipient and the Maldives monetary authority, the cancellation will not incur any adverse impact on the Project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Maldives!$!MV","sector1":{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance
