The project would: (a) support the extension of basic health services; (b) improve the effectiveness of basic health services; and (c) strengthen central policy making and coordination of investment in health. Specifically, the project would include three components. First, a service delivery component consists of extending maternal and child care in the marginal and low-income areas of La Paz, El Alto, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. The credit would finance the extension of pre- and post-natal care, reproductive health care, child development and nutritional control, prevention and control of diarrheal and respiratory diseases. The credit would also finance construction, rehabilitation, equipment and management of health centers. The second component is human resources development consisting of the development of decentralized training capacity, training and supervision of selected staff, and health education campaigns. The third component is institutional development covering the reorganization of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Public Health (MPSSP), in its Planning, Human Resources, Administration and General directorates, and in the regional units involved in the project."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":82},"sector2":{"Name":"Central
