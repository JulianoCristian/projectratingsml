There are four components. The first, community-based distribution, recruits community-based distribution agents (CBDAs) to distribute contraceptives; provides supervision by CBDA supervisors, health centers, family planning coordinators, and the district health management team (DHMT); funds an incentive package for the CBDAs, plus salaries, motorcycles, and motor vehicles; and finances a wide mix of contraceptive products. Component 2 supports the development, pre-testing, production, and dissemination of information, education, and communication materials (IEC); distributes materials in local languages on the advantages and safety of family planning (FP) and the dangers of STDs/AIDS; modifies attitudes towards youth reproductive needs; and provides training. Component 3 improves the capacity of health professionals to support FP services through clinical training; provides clinical supervision to CBDAs; supports the FP coordinator; and manages the contraceptive logistics system. Component 4 develops standard training protocols for service skills, counseling, supervision, and performance assessments for CBDAs and their supervisors; trains service providers and their supervisors; and disseminates educational messages."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,88,57","mjthemecode":"7,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040603093533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040603093533","DocDate":"25-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123520418","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123520418","DocURL":"13-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123520519","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123520519","DocDate":"13-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123520418","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123520418","DocDate":"13-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000178830_98111703555136","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703555136","DocDate":"23-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185448","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
