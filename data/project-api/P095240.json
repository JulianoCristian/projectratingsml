This restructuring paper seeks your approval to proceed with changes to the project. The restructuring is taking place under an operating environment defined by the March 2009 application. However, on February 21, 2012 the Board discussed an interim strategy note for Madagascar to guide Bank engagement during FY12-13. The restructuring is consistent with the interim strategy notes (ISN's) approach to restructure the portfolio. The changes will ensure that the project supports only critical 'low hanging fruit' investments aimed at quick efficiency improvements and relevant technical assistance and analytical work. Taking into account the fragile environment and weak institutional capacity, the primary objective of the analytical and technical work will be to help the authorities address binding constraints to improved service delivery and investment, through the identification of priorities that could be implemented even in a scenario in which donors remain disengaged from the sector. In a more favorable scenario under which progress towards the resolution of the political crisis would pave the way for donor reengagement, the sector would be positioned to deliver quick results, thanks to an improved policy framework and finalized feasibility studies for new investments. The restructuring will amend the project's legal agreement by: (i) revising the Project Development Objective (PDO); (ii) changing the lending instrument from APL to Sector Investments Loan (SIL) and changing the project's name; (iii) revising planned"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Projet de restructuration et de r\u00e9habilitation du Secteur de l\u2019eau et de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Projet de restructuration et de r\u00e9habilitation du Secteur de l\u2019eau et de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 \u00e0 Madagascar a pour objectif de r\u00e9tablir des services publics ad\u00e9quats d\u2019eau et d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 dans les zones urbaines, et de jeter les bases pour une expansion durable d\u2019un service \u00e0 vocation commerciale dans des conditions propres \u00e0 assurer le meilleur rapport co\u00fbt-efficacit\u00e9.
