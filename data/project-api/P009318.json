The principal components of the project would be: (i) a three-year time slice of a payment strengthening program; (ii) a three-year time slice of a road maintenance and improvement program; and (iii) technical assistance for RCMD. The recurrent costs of the maintenance and improvement program, amounting to $17.3 million, would be met in full by the Government. The project works would be carried out by RCMD, which needs an expanding capacity for executing work of the type envisaged. There are no domestic highway contractors, and, given the history of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for road contracts in Afghanistan, prospects for effective ICB for the proposed work are considered poor."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"17,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"AF","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3961007011405","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007011405","DocDate":"30-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd1ab_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd1ab_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c78_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c78_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902331254","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902331254","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan"}},"facets":{}}
