There are four main project components. The first implements bilingual education in primary education by financing textbook and learning material production and distribution; training teachers, school directors, inspectors, and pedagogic advisors; and evaluating student learning and teacher quality. The second component finances training for school management committees, adult literacy, and community awareness as well as school improvement projects. The third component procures consultants, develops workshops, and decentralizes financial and management procedures. The fourth component strengthens implementation capacity by financing technical assistance, training , logistics, and equipment costs for project coordination."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":63},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"3,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"EL,BH,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,26,71,57,65","mjthemecode":"8,7,9,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":63},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040312125317","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040312125317","DocDate":"08-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201110809","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201110809","DocURL":"26-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00021805401060","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00021805401060","DocDate":"21-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000334955_20080926063001","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080926063001","DocDate":"21-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99080405381016","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99080405381016","DocDate":"21-JUN-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
