The two main components will: 1) provide support in addressing systemic financial sector issues, by reinforcing banking supervision, through the Central Bank. Included is the support for the payments system reform, through policy advice on risk control management, operational upgrading, and development of an efficient government securities market. Banking supervision will be strengthened, through a combination of studies, information technology upgrade, policy formulation, and training assistance. In addition, improvements in the banking system safety net will be supported, through a revision of bank failure resolution rules, initiation of contingency planning, and improved monitoring of bank interventions; and, 2) strengthen regulation, and compliance, and, increase transparency and investor protection in the area of securities markets, by supporting the Brazilian Securities Commission - CVM.
