Specifically, the project is designed to: 1) increase the availability, range and quality of services provided by primary health care facilities and raion hospitals; 2) reorient service delivery toward more cost effective health care; 3) decentralize decision making for capital investments to the facility level; and 4) support policy development through the introduction of national health accounts. The project will have three main components: 1) medical equipment including related supplies and training, furniture, spare parts and maintenance equipment to targeted health care facilities - both primary (polyclinics, women's clinics and feldsher stations) and secondary (raion hospitals and maternity homes); 2) national health accounts; and 3) project management."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"270,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,67","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03020604020960","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03020604020960","DocDate":"06-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200245018","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200245018","DocURL":"27-AUG-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029225532","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029225532","DocDate":"16-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
