The project consists of five components: 1) This component will support capacity building for producers organizations (both local and national) and inter-professional organizations to improve market access and provide, manage, and finance services to their members. 2) This component will support public, cooperative, and private services that deliver producer services focused on increasing quality, value added, and market access. 3) This component will support public, cooperative, and private services that deliver producer services to livestock producers, with particular focus on improving quality of services and their sustainability through progressive transfer and cost recovery. 4) This component will aim at protecting Tunisian produce from plant diseases and predators, and at protecting consumers from pesticide residues, and thereby increasing the value and market access of produce. 5) This component will maximize the coverage, reliability, and availability of statistics and information for all parties making choices affecting the sector. It will also support project management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"21,330,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"BC,AJ,YA,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"75,77,41","mjthemecode":"4,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":65},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":19},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20130710125110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130710125110","DocDate":"27-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090821014229","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090821014229","DocDate":"30-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041414223175","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041414223175","DocDate":"02-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01060604005223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060604005223","DocDate":"31-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20040804124453","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040804124453","DocDate":"25-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060904004529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060904004529","DocDate":"25-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0010180533291","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0010180533291","DocDate":"15-MAY-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
