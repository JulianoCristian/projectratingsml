Within this framework, it focuses on actions aimed at improving the business and investment climate, creating fiscal space for greater social investment and achieving key milestones in improving the fiduciary environment. Other key areas for growth identified in education, health and nutrition and rural infrastructure are supported within the CAS program through investment operations, which build on the ongoing portfolio of interventions in these areas. Future DPL operations are expected to focus more intensively on the growth agenda (trade, investment climate, public private partnerships, access to credit by SME) while maintaining attention to transparency and efficiency in public spending."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guatemala!$!GT","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"GT","sectorcode":"AZ,BH,FZ,YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Trade and integration","Trade and integration","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"28,47,49,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,5,5,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090813234553","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090813234553","DocDate":"30-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2010031512234140","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010031512234140","DocURL":"05-JAN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2010031512234140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010031512234140","DocDate":"05-JAN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000090341_20050616094001","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050616094001","DocDate":"09-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050607120527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050607120527","DocDate":"02-JUN-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guatemala","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
