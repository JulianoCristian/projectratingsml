This first phase will thus reverse biodiversity trends in priority, protected areas, through the following components: 1) National capacity building will support decentralized management of protected areas, through financing by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to the Forestry Department, building awareness and providing training for staff, concessionaires, and private operators. Additionally, studies and workshops will be conducted to support sector reforms, i.e., legal, and institutional reforms, and economic and financial analysis of protected areas. Moreover, monitoring, information, and communication systems will be implemented to attain international coordination in the subject. 2) The GEF will finance incremental support to set advisory fora on the subject of protected areas, wildlife conservation units, and provincial services, including technical assistance and training, for agriculture, livestock, and education development. Community awareness will be intensified through local training, and institution building. The initial protected area management shall identify areas, to diagnose pastoral land tenure uses in the Sahel; study conservation dynamics in the Kabore-Nazinga-Sissili complex; diagnose water resources at the Mares aux Hippos Biosphere Reserve; and, prepare and implement protected areas management plans, i.e., construction and infrastructure development, and, surveillance and monitoring of local ecosystems. 3) Incremental support will be financed by the GEF for the National Steering Committee, the Scientific Technical Advisory Council, and the Conseil National pour la Gestion de l'Environnement.
