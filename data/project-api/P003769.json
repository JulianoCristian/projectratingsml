The project will also help to strengthen the ability of the Directorate-General of Water Resources Development to plan and execute a large program of works. The project consists of three construction components: Kali Progo (34,700 ha); Way Seputih (25,000 ha); and Way Sekampung (to be expanded from 32,400 ha to 65,100 ha) and an Investigations and Designs component, consisting of feasibility studies and detailed design work for a number of dams. Two of these dams are critical to the realization of benefits from the proposed project works. Following their construction, the project will benefit about 189,000 families and will increase rice production by 273,000 tons per year. Project risks are normal for projects of this kind."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"140,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902305689","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902305689","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912375275","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912375275","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e2d5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e2d5_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
