The project consists of three components.  i) Rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure will support emergency repairs and selective low-cost rehabilitation of inter-farm irrigation infrastructure.  This includes the rehabilitation, completion, or improvement in monitoring systems of up to 12 irrigation dams.  It will also support inter-farm canal networks to improve drainage.  ii) Capacity building will include implementation support of the Project Implementation Unit which handles the daily management, administration, and coordination of the project.  This component will also support institutional development by financing office equipment, machinery, software to assist oblast and rayon offices in the effective planning, operation, maintenance, and management of irrigation and dam systems.  It will also support various training activities and study tours.  iii) Incremental maintenance will assist with the financing of maintenance works for inter-farm irrigation infrastructure associated with the subprojects."},"country_namecode":"Kyrgyz Republic!$!KG","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":35},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"KG","sectorcode":"BC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"77,78,85","mjthemecode":"11,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":65},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":35}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20070215094933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20070215094933","DocDate":"25-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123491406","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123491406","DocURL":"22-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123491205","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123491205","DocURL":"22-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903284656","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903284656","DocDate":"13-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980624090009","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624090009","DocDate":"30-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_99111006272084","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99111006272084","DocDate":"17-OCT-1997"}],"countryname":"Kyrgyz Republic"}},"facets":{}}
