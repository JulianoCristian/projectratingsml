There are two components to the project. The first component of the project will support specific activities designed to promote economic recovery and development through addressing areas identified as needing further efforts, or which have not yet been addressed. It will support sub-projects that address critical issues affecting economic development in Aceh by contributing to building a more competitive and supportive business environment necessary to create broad based private sector job opportunities and growth in Aceh, targeting the poor and other vulnerable groups. The EDFF will support sub-projects which fill-in strategic and financing gaps, based upon the vision for economic development explicit in the RPJMD, in the following areas: a) improving the business environment; b) private sector support; and c) public infrastructure. The second component of the project will fund project management and capacity building including an international consultancy to assist the GoA in the establishment and management of the Project Management Unit (PMU) and the KPDT in the implementation of the project at the central government level. This will include sub-project assessment and review, procurement, financial management, safeguards compliance, implementation, supervision, monitoring, etc. In addition, the firm will also provide training and skills development to the local staff at PMU and the Ministry for Disadvantaged Areas (KPDT)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture,
