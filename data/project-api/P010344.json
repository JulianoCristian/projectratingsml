In addition, it would assist in : a) rationalizing investments for rural electrification, b) establishing a long term framework for extending the rural network at least cost, c) capturing the benefits of investments already made, while improving the reliability of service and reducing network losses, and d) minimizing the generating capacity shortfalls through the better management of load. The project consists of two components. The first is infrastructure development which includes extending electricity supply to new villages, connecting to grid settlements of already electrified villages, expanding consumer connections, reinforcing the network, and extending the supply to tubewells. The second is technical assitance which would provide for mapping of villages, installing load management schemes and consultancy services."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"160,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development"],"themecode":"78","mjthemecode":"10,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980804142818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980804142818","DocDate":"29-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123260555","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123260555","DocURL":"02-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123260555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123260555","DocDate":"02-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123260253","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123260253","DocURL":"02-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123260454","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123260454","DocURL":"02-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123260253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123260253","DocDate":"02-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123260454","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123260454","DocDate":"02-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928120852","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928120852","DocDate":"27-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928120712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928120712","DocDate":"27-NOV-1989"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
