The project would provide FDA with increased staff, buildings, vehicles, equipment, and staff training as well as technical assistance required to undertake various policy studies. The project would also establish a 1,600 ha industrial trial plantation of fast-growing commercial species. The principal benefits of the project would be increase Government revenue from forest taxes and improved Government capability to formulate and implement rational forest policies and investment programs. The trial plantation under the project may lead to development of a large-scale industrial plantation and possibly the establishment of a pulp industry in Liberia."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Liberia!$!LR","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LR","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924184245","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924184245","DocDate":"22-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfcff8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfcff8_1_0","DocDate":"11-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c1e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c1e_1_0","DocDate":"11-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902312033","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902312033","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912384662","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912384662","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Liberia"}},"facets":{}}
