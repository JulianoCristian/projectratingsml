CESAN's investment in water supply will significantly improve systems operation, eliminate existing bottlenecks, incorporate low-income urban areas into CESAN's systems, and increase the service coverage level in the State by about two percent (to 93 percent). The sanitation subcomponent includes the construction of 12 sewerage systems and 10 sewage treatment plants, to increase the service coverage level in the State by about 32 percent (to 43 percent). CESAN's institutional strengthening component seeks to improve the company's management capacity, operational efficiency, and financial performance through studies, technical assistance, and training in selected areas. SEAMA's institutional strengthening component seeks to reinforce its institutional capacity for water resources management and monitoring of water quality and pollution programs; and to improve its operational and administrative capability."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Water
