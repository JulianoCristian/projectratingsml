The project will continue efforts initiated under the first Decentralized and Regional Development (DRD) project to strengthen the participation of poor, rural communities in local government investment planning and implementation and to strengthen the institutional capacity of state and local governments to support rural development efforts. The project will thus: (a) improve basic infrastructure and support income-generating investments in poor rural areas of the eight states; (b) strengthen institutional mechanisms and capacity at the federal and state levels to plan, supervise, monitor, and evaluate rural water supply, rural roads and other rural development strategies with the participation of municipalities and beneficiary communities; and (c) strengthen the capacity of rural and semi-rural municipalities to finance, plan, implement, and operate rural infrastructure investments, using appropriate technologies and participation of affected communities. The project will have five components: (a) municipal investment and institutional development; (b) rural water supply; (c) rural roads rehabilitation and maintenance; (d) income-generating component; and (e) the Secretariat of Social Development (SEDESOL) institutional developement and project coordination."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Water
