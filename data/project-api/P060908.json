The components will: 1) finance, and, design detailed definition of priorities in the focal areas for conservation and sustainable use of bio-diversity, through participatory community planning and through biological and ecological expertise provision. Integrated monitoring and evaluation systems will be established, setting performance indicators on bio-ecological, socioeconomic, and institutional aspects; 2) promote the removal of institutional, technical, and information barriers currently preventing bio-diversity management options, through regular rural, social, and infrastructure development programs. Bio-diversity impact analysis, and assessments on corridor strategies will be financed, to include institutional capacity building, and technical assistance and training on program design and execution; and, 3) develop an integrated approach for promoting sustainable uses of bio-diversity, to maintain native ecosystems, restore degraded ecosystems, and develop biological resources through capacity building, training programs, and implementation of pilot projects."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican
