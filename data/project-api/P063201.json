The project consists of three components. First, the quick-disbursing component will finance critically needed imports for the recovery program, including food, medicine, housing construction materials, and chemical products. Second, the reconstruction & mitigation component will reconstruct bridges and highway sections in three phases. It will also rehabilitate the principal irrigation schemes, rehabilitate and upgrade part of the 69 kilovolt transmission system and an 8 megawatt hydropower plant and access road, and restructure and modernize key national institutions responsible for emergency preparedness and disaster management. The third component will be responsible for project implementation support."},"country_namecode":"Dominican Republic!$!DO","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"Power","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"111,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"DO","sectorcode":"BC,LD,AI,TA,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"52","mjthemecode":"6,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":55},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":20},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":11},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040107112238","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040107112238","DocDate":"23-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99092004315654","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99092004315654","DocDate":"02-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910543875","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910543875","DocDate":"03-DEC-1998"}],"countryname":"Dominican Republic"}},"facets":{}}
