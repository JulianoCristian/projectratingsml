The project would consist of about 5,000 km of 20-kv transmission and 380/220-volt distribution lines and related equipment, about 70 MVA of distribution transformer capacity and 33 man-years of consulting services. The project would serve approximately 900,000 rural population in 1,200 villages in 11 out of the 14 Mohafazats (administrative districts) in Syria. No particular project risks are presently envisaged; however, the project is contingent on the completion of the related 66-kV transmission lines and 66/20-kV substations included in EPE's 1977-82 construction program."},"country_namecode":"Syrian Arab Republic!$!SY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"SY","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190229178","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190229178","DocDate":"31-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191225493","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191225493","DocDate":"31-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f80_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f80_1_0","DocDate":"14-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f7f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f7f_1_0","DocDate":"14-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f7e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f7e_1_0","DocDate":"14-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f7d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f7d_1_0","DocDate":"14-MAR-1978"}],"countryname":"Syrian Arab Republic"}},"facets":{}}
