It consist of four project components. 1) Early childhood development (ECD) will develop policy options to widely increase coverage and improve quality for ECD programs by developing an upgraded and expanded training program for ECD trainers and teachers, and conducting a feasibility study to explore the possibility of attaching community-run ECD centers to primary schools, particularly in inaccessible areas. 2) Primary and secondary education will finance six sub-components to increase access and equity and enhance quality and efficiency of primary and secondary education. The sub-components include: curriculum and assessment; teacher development and support; physical construction; targeted equity-based program; school-level management; and capacity building in planning, monitoring, and evaluation. 3) Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) will improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the TVET system in order to better train Basotho to compete locally and in regional niches and to ensure graduates have the skill mix demanded by the national economy. 4) Non-formal education will improve the quality of life for Basotho who have missed out on formal schooling by equipping them with skills."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Lesotho!$!LS","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":43},"sector3":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":2},"sector5":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"21,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"}],"docty":"Agreement,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"LS","sectorcode":"EL,EC,EV,EP,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"61,51,65,88,78","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,8,8,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":45},{"Name":"Education","Percent":43},{"Name":"Education","Percent":8},{"Name":"Education","Percent":2},{"Name":"Education","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2010102715141513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010102715141513","DocDate":"29-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040507104559","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040507104559","DocDate":"29-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201045133","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201045133","DocURL":"21-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201045133","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201045133","DocDate":"21-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9904020600051","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9904020600051","DocDate":"25-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911072297","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911072297","DocDate":"30-JUN-1998"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Lesotho","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
