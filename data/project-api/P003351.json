At full development, the net annual incremental forest output is estimated at about 72,000 Hoppus (H) tons of teak and 220,000 H tons of hardwood, valued at about US$90 million after processing. The project would generate additional direct employment for about 3,000 workers and create new permanent employment for about 1,700 landless farm families. The rate of return to the economy is estimated at over 100 percent."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar!$!MM","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MM","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924171158","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924171158","DocDate":"28-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd0ad_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd0ad_1_0","DocDate":"09-AUG-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd0ac_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd0ac_1_0","DocDate":"09-AUG-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190233378","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190233378","DocDate":"31-JUL-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar"}},"facets":{}}
