The tubewell irrigation systems to be rehabilitated or constructed under the project will be distributed in 26 of Northern Bihar's 38 administrative districts. The Bihar PublicTubewell Project will comprise a seven-year program and will support several components. They will comprise:  (i) construction of about 500 new public tubewells; (ii) modernization of about 1000 existing tubewells; (iii) rehabilitation of about 3700 other existing tubewells; and (iv) construction of power lines to about 5200 tubewells so that sufficient power is available to achieve planned irrigation intensities.  In addition, the project will include (v) improvements to management capability, through construction of buildings, provision of vehicles and equipment, training, monitoring and evaluation; and (vi) provision of technical services to undertake special studies including management, socio-economic performance and cost recovery."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"68,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008032714","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008032714","DocDate":"28-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36bb1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36bb1_1_0","DocDate":"16-OCT-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36baf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36baf_1_0","DocDate":"16-OCT-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702134706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702134706","DocDate":"31-AUG-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
