SINSC will include: (i) a real-time supervision system (RTSS) to be located at a national supervision and coordination center (CSC) in Brasilia (to be owned and operated by ELETROBRAS/GCOI); (ii) data acquisition and control systems (DACS) to be located at the systems operations centers (COSs) of Brazil's nine major electric power companies and the Itaipu hydroelectric plant; and (iii) telecommunications links. The project consists of the initial components of SINSC which are at an advanced stage of preparation: the national Center (CSC) in Brasilia, and the systems operations (COS) of CHESF, one of ELETROBRAS' major subsidiaries. The project also includes a sector-wide training program to be carried by ELETROBRAS. SINSC is expected to result in overall improvement in sector management, significant future reductions in capital investments in generation and transmission facilities, lower reserve requirements for such facilities, lower requirements for fossil fuels for power generation, improvements for fossil fuels for power generation, improvements in reliability of electricity supply, and less industrial output."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"54,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"PY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","code":"PY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902355984","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902355984","DocDate":"31-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912493183","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912493183","DocDate":"31-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e975d8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975d8_1_0","DocDate":"23-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e975d6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975d6_1_0","DocDate":"23-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e975d5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975d5_1_0","DocDate":"23-DEC-1980"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
