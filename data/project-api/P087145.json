There are five components to the project, the first component being intra-village development. This component will build institutional capacity of pro-poor local institutions, and fund village development and livelihood-related investments at the village level. The second component is the inter-village connectivity development. This component will promote inter-village development to consolidate and sustain investments generated at the village level. The third component is the public, people, and private sector partnerships. This component will support and strengthen the project teams, public sector agencies and other stakeholders at the national, provincial, district, divisional, and cluster level in operationalizing of the Community Driven Development (CDD) approach to respond to the needs of the poor. The fourth component is the project management and monitoring. This component will facilitate overall coordination, planning, implementation, compliance check and quality, learning and monitoring of the project at the national, provincial level, and district level. Finally, the fifth component is the convergence and policy support."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Other social
