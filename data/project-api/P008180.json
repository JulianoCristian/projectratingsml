The project consists of the completion of construction of about 94 km of multilane, toll expressways or \"autopistas\". Two separate sections of autopista are involved, one of 59 km in length from Tejerias to Coche, in continuation of the existing expressway from Valencia, and the other of 35 km in length from Valencia to Puerto Cabello. The project will yield a reasonable economic return on capital investment, resulting principally from the savings in vehicle operating costs by using the new highway facilities as an alternative to the existing inadequate and congested roads."},"country_namecode":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela!$!VE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"VE","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902343528","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902343528","DocDate":"31-DEC-1961"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e65fc5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e65fc5_1_0","DocDate":"13-DEC-1961"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a702_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a702_1_0","DocDate":"13-DEC-1961"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a701_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a701_1_0","DocDate":"13-DEC-1961"}],"countryname":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela"}},"facets":{}}
