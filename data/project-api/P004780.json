The principal project objective is to grant secure, documented tenure to rural landholders, thereby facilitating their access to institutional credit, improving investments in the land, and increasing agricultural productivity and family incomes. This objective addresses the key issues of rural poverty and underemployment. Project components consist of the following : a) accelerated cadastral mapping of 155,00 sq km of rural land; b) the issuance of full titles for undocumented lands and lands held under various types of pre-ownership certificates; c) improved land administration through decentralization of the land register; d) strengthening of the Central Valuation Authority; e) strengthening the Department of Lands; and f) provision of project related technical assistance, training and studies."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":33},"theme1":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":11},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83,75,26,59,36","mjthemecode":"3,7,2,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":67},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":33}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980901092424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980901092424","DocDate":"08-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102407","DocDate":"15-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929065237","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929065237","DocDate":"07-AUG-1990"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
