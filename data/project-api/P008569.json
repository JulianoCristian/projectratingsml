These objectives support the country's efforts to rapidly enhance creditworthiness by improving the balance of payments and to launch effective industrial restructuring programs and private sector development initiatives in line with the ongoing reforms. The project comprises two components. The first component would include investments in state-owned and private exporting industrial enterprises for which Bank funds would be channeled through selected participating banks. The second component would include technical assistance aimed at: (a) improving the banking system; (b) supporting the restructuring of industry; and (c) supporting measures to stimulate the rapid development of the private sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"260,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"FA,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Economic management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,23,45","mjthemecode":"5,1,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":98},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0001130530303","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0001130530303","DocDate":"21-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042914053233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042914053233","DocDate":"27-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042014203934","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042014203934","DocDate":"22-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041410193035","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041410193035","DocDate":"22-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926181712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926181712","DocDate":"03-JAN-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland"}},"facets":{}}
