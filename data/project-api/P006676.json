The Secano's diverse and fragile resource base, along with a lack of effective regional poverty alleviation strategies, argues for a project which can validate alternative development approaches. The heterogeneity of Secano conditions call for a micro-regional approach starting with pilot-scale sub-projects in representative areas to test the technological, social and institutional actions considered to be most likely to succeed. The project will develop viable strategies which will: a) improve natural resource management to reverse soil degradation and establish sustainable production systems; and b) expand off-farm economic activities and improve economic infrastructure to diversify income sources and boost regional development. The results of the micro-regional endeavors will serve as economically viable and environmentally sound models for possible eventual larger government-funded programs, covering a greater area of Secano. Project components will be: a) natural resource management and sustainable development; b) off-farm poverty alleviation; c) support services; d) technical assistance; e) land title regularization; and f) studies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":38},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"TA,FE,BH,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"85,86,78,80,83","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11,10,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":38},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":12},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01072804145996","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072804145996","DocDate":"25-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123100191","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123100191","DocURL":"26-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacba3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacba3_1_0","DocDate":"16-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029221646","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029221646","DocDate":"05-DEC-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
