The main reasons for the changes are to: (i) fund a contract overrun on Bamako - Bougouni road works, which are being successfully executed; (ii) reduce road works on Sevare - Gao from 407 km to an aggregate 85 km of the most deteriorated sections to continue to meet the objective of providing land access to the northern region; and (iii) extend the project closing date to complete the works on Sevare - Gao road agreed within the restructured project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":66},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social
