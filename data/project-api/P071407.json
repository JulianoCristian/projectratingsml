This is to be achieved by improving sector specific policy and regulatory frameworks and strengthening the capacity of government agencies to implement them. The development objective will also be supported through selective public investments that stimulate private investments. The reallocation is necessary to allow for adequate distribution of funds to complete most project activities prior to closing date on November 31, 2011. The funds reallocated originate from a failed road contract in Kafue National Park which has been cancelled in July 2011. Funds were reallocated to small contractors tasked to complete a significant portion of the planned civil work in the park and to purchase road maintenance equipment which will increase the sustainability of the infrastructure network in the park."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
