The project has four components. The first improves the business environment: it finances the services of an expatriate consultant who will implement the decrees on improving start-up procedures and business inspections; funds a diagnostic analysis and surveys; and thereafter, it simplifies business procedures, including business registration. The second component helps revenue mobilization, provides financing for an international customs advisor, and supports the customs modernization and reform. The third component strengthens the state energy agency in its institutional and technical capacity, thus enabling it to prepare detailed market rules governing the operation of the unbundled electricity and gas sectors; and to monitor rule implementation. This component also assists the Government's efforts to privatize the country's gas and electricity distribution companies; strengthens the financial viability of the gas company; helps carry out an audit; helps implement, monitor, and assess a social assistance compensation strategy for urban areas undergoing significant household utility tax increases; supports the public relations campaign; and purchases gas meters, parts, materials, and equipment. The fourth component supports project management, other technical assistance, and contingencies."},"country_namecode":"Kyrgyz Republic!$!KG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":23},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"KG","sectorcode":"LC,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,34,40,28,43","mjthemecode":"4,2,4,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":80},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20101220005418","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101220005418","DocDate":"27-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010043016045355","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010043016045355","DocDate":"15-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031214273656","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031214273656","DocDate":"23-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0006130535036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0006130535036","DocDate":"25-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00011905351077","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00011905351077","DocDate":"05-JAN-2000"}],"countryname":"Kyrgyz Republic"}},"facets":{}}
