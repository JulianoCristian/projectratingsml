The program is central to the Government's strategy to: 1) reduce poverty and improve the conditions of life in the rural areas; 2) improve agricultural productivity; 3) optimize the use of available resources; and 4) protect the environment by generalizing the delivery of professional agricultural services to all levels of the farming community. The main project components are: 1) strengthening the delivery of the agricultural extension services and providing support for farmers' organizations through the provision of transport, equipment, rehabilitation of facilities and incremental operating costs; 2) improving the technical and management capacity of agricultural staff through training by the provision of equipment, supplies, facilities and transport for regular in-service training of extension staff and the rehabilitation of at least two agricultural training colleges; and 3) support for financial management, accounting and auditing, monitoring and evaluation and regular supervision at all levels of the national agricultural extension system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"25,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MG","sectorcode":"AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development"],"themecode":"78","mjthemecode":"10,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01070704012084","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01070704012084","DocDate":"23-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121261157","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121261157","DocURL":"17-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121261157","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121261157","DocDate":"17-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23e82_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23e82_1_0","DocDate":"23-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019104638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019104638","DocDate":"03-MAY-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Madagascar"}},"facets":{}}
