The project provides funds for seasonal and medium term credit.  It also provides for additional staff, staff training, technical assistance, vehicles, equipment and other facilities to transform the existing credit unit of the Agricultural Department of Ministry of Agriculture into a Smallholder Credit Administration, with departmental status.  The new credit administration has responsibility for management at a national level of smallholder credit funds.  Moreover, the project provides for a pilot credit scheme for the rural poor, which will attempt to adapt to Malawian conditions, a system of group credit for non-land based economic activities similar to the successful IFAD-funded Grameen Bank project in Bangladesh."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170835","DocDate":"03-JAN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030814084635","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030814084635","DocDate":"22-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36cd0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36cd0_1_0","DocDate":"17-NOV-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926123045","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926123045","DocDate":"09-OCT-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
