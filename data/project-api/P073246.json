This would be accomplished by three project components: The first component, Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Policies and Strategies,  includes a host of technical assistance activities that will support CNE in addressing strategic issues for the sector, the implementation of the PLANER and the promotion of renewable sources of energy. The second component, Rural Electrification Subprojects, finance pilot installations to provide electricity services to up to 16,000 households, public centers and productive users in selected pilot sites remote from the main grid. The third component, Microfinance Services, supports a set of increasingly sustainable financial institutions that provide a range of financial services to low-income households and micro- and small businesses in project sites and extended economic zones, which are therefore able to take full advantage of the opportunities provided by rural electrification."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
