The goal of the INSTANSI DPL series is to assist the Government of Indonesia to achieve its medium-term growth, poverty reduction, and shared prosperity objectives by supporting measures to enhance Indonesia's capacity and institutions for targeting poverty reduction measures, introducing a major social insurance program, and enhancing the management of public finances for better service delivery. The operation was previously envisioned to be the second of a two-year, programmatic DPL series. However, the government has recently indicated the possibility of extending the series from two to three years. Tentative triggers for a third operation have been developed. The INSTANSI DPL-2 Project supports a set of policy actions surrounding the following two pillars: (i) enhancing poverty alleviation and shared prosperity efforts through improved governance and institutional accountability, better measurement and targeting of the poor and vulnerable in social assistance programs, and implementation of a new national social security system (Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional, SJSN); and (ii) strengthening public financial management (PFM) through improvements in the medium-term results orientation of the budget process, the introduction of a more efficient and effective automated budget and treasury system, streamlining of budget execution procedures, and improved accounting, audit, tax administration and sub-national fiscal management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":30},"theme4":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":10},"totalcommamt":"400,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Statutory Committee Report,Program Document,Letter of Development Policy","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BK,BH,JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"28,27,54,53","mjthemecode":"6,6,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b08214e21b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08214e21b_1_0","DocDate":"20-NOV-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Statutory Committee Report (SCR),  Vol.","DocType":"SCR","EntityID":"090224b08214de65_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08214de65_1_0","DocDate":"01-NOV-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000456286_20131030150624","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20131030150624","DocDate":"21-OCT-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Letter of Development Policy (DPL),  Vol.","DocType":"DPL","EntityID":"090224b08214de89_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08214de89_1_0","DocDate":"30-SEP-2013"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
