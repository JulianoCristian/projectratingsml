There are six project components. Component 1 increases active community participation and self-reliance in the planning processes of Agrarian Reform Communities (ARC) and in implementing integrated community-identified priorities. It also builds the capacity of ARC peoples organizations, such as the \"barangay\" implementing team, cooperatives, associations, farmers' groups, women's groups, producer groups, as well as strengthening the capacity of DAR and LGUs to support appropriate development activities. Component 2 provides essential rural infrastructure which contributes directly to sustaining increases in rural incomes of the target beneficiaries based on community demand-driven approach. The infrastructure includes rural roads, bridges, small-scale irrigation, potable water supply systems, post-harvesting facilities, and social buildings. Component 3 provides strategic support services to help generate viable increases in agricultural productivity and diversification. Component 4 comprises capacity building support to cooperatives and micrfinance institutions. Components 5 and 6 provide implementation and project management support, respectively."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration
