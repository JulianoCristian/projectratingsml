The components include: a) institutional strengthening aimed at improving and harmonizing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's (MADR's) multiple approaches to integrated rural development, developing a structured response to drought, and putting in place the capacity and tools (both at the central and local levels) for identifying, preparing, implementing and monitoring rural development programs in rainfed areas; and (b) development activities in Priority Action Zones (PAZs) which are among the poorest areas of the country and suffering from major handicaps in terms of rural infrastructure and access to basic social services.  Activities to be implemented are in six zones: the Provinces of Boulemane, Khemisset, Khouribga, Sidi-Kacem, Taroudant and Tata. Activities in a seventh zone, in the Province of Errachidia, will be identified during the first two years of project implementation and included thereafter.  The development activities will fall into two categories corresponding to two different types of rainfed areas: poverty reduction activities in low-rainfall and remote areas, including the Atlas Mountains, Pre-Saharan Oases, High Eastern Plateau, and the Central Arid Zone; and agricultural growth promoting activities in higher rainfall areas, including the Cereal Plains and the Rif Foothills."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and
