To this end, the components will: 1) support the development of human resources in the areas of health care provision - particularly paramedicals - and management, through the provision of training, strengthening teaching capacity, and monitoring internships; 2) support district health services in under-served areas, through the consolidation of health services activities, with those under the Social Development Action, and the Health and Safe Motherhood Projects, allowing expansion of health services, and accessibility to health care. This will reinforce delivery of minimum, and complementary activities, supporting management, and supervisory capacities, and render those currently under-served health districts, operational; 3) Strengthen health financing, and management in support of the decentralization process. The central level capacity will be reinforced, to design sector reforms, translated into project-targeted areas. Community participation will be developed to achieve cost-recovery, and initiate innovative practices; 4) build the institutional capacity of MOPH, specifically, to support the pharmaceutical, and health communications policies. The AIDS control strategy will be strengthened, by supporting mobilization of civil society, and improving the epidemiological surveillance system, to limit HIV transmission risks; and, 5) assist the government in collecting socio-demographic data to improve, and monitor progress in the health, and population sectors. A health, nutrition, and population survey will be conducted by 2002, envisaged to contribute to the 2003 census."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":79},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"41,510,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TD","sectorcode":"BK,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"63,26,67,69","mjthemecode":"8,8,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":79},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070731134706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070731134706","DocDate":"28-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201121558","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201121558","DocURL":"10-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201121859","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201121859","DocURL":"10-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00041205301821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00041205301821","DocDate":"30-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99032505584894","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99032505584894","DocDate":"28-FEB-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chad"}},"facets":{}}
