The project would finance investments in (i) new port infrastructure and shore facilities to serve as a base for coastal fishing activities along the Tunisian coast; (ii) boat repair facilities and ice making and cold storage equipment; (iii) boat construction for 400 boats of 11.25 m overall length and 30 boats of 13.80 m overall length; and (iv) training equipment and vehicles. Technical assistance for construction, supervision, training and preparation of studies for the expansion of ports in Tabarka and Kelibia and research on the potential of lagoon fishing and exploitable fish stocks would also be financed. The main risk involved in the project would result from a delay in the implementation and operation of the new organizational set-up proposed under the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"28,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"AF","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","code":"AF"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924220418","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924220418","DocDate":"19-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902332785","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902332785","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e95dfd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95dfd_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e95dfb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95dfb_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
