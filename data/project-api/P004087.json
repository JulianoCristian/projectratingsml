Enterprises engaged in freezing and cold storage, canning, drying, pickling and other preservation of fruits, vegetables, meat and fisheries products, oil seed extract, processing of grain based food, raw silk spinning, and production of fruit juice based beverages, dairy products, and animal feeds would be the main subborrowers. The proposed project will benefit the farmers through widening their market opportunities, provide increased supplies, better quality and larger variety of processed foods throughout the year to consumers and assist in dampening the supply and price fluctuations of farm produce, reduce the wastage of such produce through spoilage and create about 5,000 additional jobs. It will also contribute to the institutional strengthening of AFDC."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e961a7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961a7_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e961a6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961a6_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902352415","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902352415","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912485718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912485718","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
