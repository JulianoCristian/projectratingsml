There are seven project components. First, track renewal and maintenance of core routes will help strengthen the existing profitable transit traffic, strengthen the prospects of new traffic, and decrease maintenance costs. Second, rehabilitation of traction units and spare parts will allow daily availability of the rehabilitated traction units to reach at least 80 percent. Third, conversion of freight wagons will provide full side-access and strengthened floors for pallets, which will allows HZ to increase its presence on revenue generating segments of the freight transport market. Fourth, rehabilitation of passenger coaches will preserve the availability of passenger cars for service through overhaul of these coaches. Fifth, environment protection will mitigate potential negative impacts on the environment. Sixth, severance payment will match the number of staff assigned to a specific activity to the actual demand. The last component will implement efficiency improvement measures at the company's management and organizational levels."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Croatia!$!HR","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":35},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"101,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"HR","sectorcode":"JB,TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,43,78,39","mjthemecode":"4,10,4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":65},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":35}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20060228114710","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060228114710","DocDate":"28-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040510500266","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040510500266","DocDate":"20-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042910424467","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042910424467","DocDate":"20-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9903191053312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903191053312","DocDate":"08-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903312093","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903312093","DocDate":"25-SEP-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Croatia"}},"facets":{}}
