The project consists of three parts: 1) The first component is to promote ownership and community participation in the provision of water supply and sanitation facilities by carrying out extension activities aimed at sensitizing water users to foster the development of appropriate facilities. 2) The second component will finance the design and construction of pilot water supply and sanitation facilities. 3) The third component will support project management and project monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":37},"sector3":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other industry"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"YW,BC,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,85,84,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,11,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":57},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":37},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000112742_20060719121550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060719121550","DocDate":"13-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050217143144","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050217143144","DocDate":"22-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00051605321580","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051605321580","DocDate":"24-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911072093","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911072093","DocDate":"11-JAN-1998"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
