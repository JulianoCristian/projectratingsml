The following components are included in the project:  (a) workover, completion and rehabilitation of 1,300 production oil wells including provision of specialized oilfield technical services; (b) in-fill drilling of 84 new wells in existing fields; (c) replacement of over 1,000 km of oil gathering lines and production flow lines which will reduce oil leakages and thus address an important environmental concern as well as recover oil currently wasted; (d) provision of a topping plant to produce refined products for oil field operations and natural gas liquids extraction units to recover hydrocarbon liquids and reduce flaring, thereby reducing CO2 and particulate emissions; and (e) technical assistance, data processing facilities and training."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"610,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,44,81,45,84","mjthemecode":"11,5,11,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200111282","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200111282","DocURL":"12-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200111282","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200111282","DocDate":"12-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200110980","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200110980","DocURL":"12-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200111181","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200111181","DocURL":"12-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200111483","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200111483","DocDate":"12-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200111483","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200111483","DocURL":"12-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200111181","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200111181","DocDate":"12-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200110980","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200110980","DocDate":"12-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004021011","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004021011","DocDate":"26-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004021427","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004021427","DocDate":"26-MAY-1993"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
