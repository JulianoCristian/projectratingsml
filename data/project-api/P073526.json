There are three project components: 1) improves tools for educational planning and management. Specifically, it improves system management capacity, including planning and management of human resources, information, evaluation, and supervision systems at the central and state levels. This component also finances human resources development, including upgrading teaching and leadership capacity; 2) focuses specifically on secondary schools with an eye to improving management and quality; some of these initiatives will eventually be adopted by primary schools. This component improves educational quality by providing didactic materials, equipment, and training; and assists community-associated management by redesigning the institutional model for planning and management by introducing school development plans (PEIs) and social community projects with parent participation; and 3) funds mechanisms to provide more equitable access to secondary education, namely through scholarship programs for poor students, alternative secondary school programs for rural and working children, and construction of prototype schools in marginal urban areas."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Paraguay!$!PY","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de reforma educativa en
