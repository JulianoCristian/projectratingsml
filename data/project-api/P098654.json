There are five components to the project. The first component of the project is mechanisms to support the closure of inefficient small coal-fired generation units. This component will support the closure of inefficient small thermal units and GHG emission reduction in Shandong (4,300 MW) and Shanxi (2,870 MW), by 2010. The component will also support the establishment and pilot operation of a transparent and effective financial incentive mechanism for the closure of small units (MCSU). The second component of the project is demonstration of power plant efficiency improvements. This component will demonstrate plant efficiency improvement and GHG emission reduction through three different types of investment activities: (i) conversion of mid-sized power generation only units into Combined Head and Power (CHP) units, at Huangtai Thermal Power Plant in Shandong; (ii) waste heat recovery at thermal power units and utilization for district heating, at Jinan Beijiao Thermal Power Plant in Shandong; and (iii) improvement of power generation efficiency resulting from plant energy audit recommendations, at Yangguang Thermal Power Plant in Shanxi. The third component of the project is transition to efficient "},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
