The project will include: (i) the installation of new electricity distribution networks in the seven selected areas; and (ii) the rehabilitation of limited existing distribution systems operated by BPDB and their integration into the new systems in the above areas. The project will support GOB efforts to expand the supply of electricity in the rural areas and finance the installation of new and the rehabilitation of some existing electricity distribution networks in seven PBS areas, of Phase II of GOB's rural electrification program. The project will include: (i) the installation of new electricity distribution networks in seven selected areas; and (ii) the rehabilitation of limited existing distribution systems operated by BPDB and their integration into the network systems in the above areas. The Supplemental Assistance to Selected Projects Project seeks to provide the Port of Chittagong with adequate capacity for handling the expected growth in general cargo and container traffic through the early 1990's. This will be achieved through the construction of two multipurpose berths suitable for servicing general cargo as well as container vessels and by improving the throughput of the existing berths by providing new cargo-handling equipment and by training of the port workers.
