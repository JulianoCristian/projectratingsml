The projects objectives are to : a) improve the energy related convertible currency earnings by increasing domestic production of natural gas and encouraging energy conservation for all forms of energy; b) contribute to a reduction of environmental pollution related to energy use; c) improve the competitive, regulatory and financial framework of sector entities through support of appropriate restructuring programs for coal, gas, power and heat sectors.  The project comprises the following major components : 1) investments in equipment and materials to increase natural gas production through development and rehabilitation of existing gas fields, gas compression, delineation of gas fields, expansion of transmission and storage facilities to transport the additional gas and respond to load fluctuations; and b) technical assistance through consultancy services, staff training and studies to enhance management and production efficiency within the sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Trade and integration","Economic management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,21,45,82,84","mjthemecode":"11,11,5,1,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99043005313683","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99043005313683","DocDate":"31-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041916063555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041916063555","DocDate":"02-JUL-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032315362756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032315362756","DocDate":"02-JUL-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928233710","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928233710","DocDate":"07-MAY-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland"}},"facets":{}}
