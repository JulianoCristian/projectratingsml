Such improvements should, in turn, restore the company's financial viability, enabling EPMB, by 1989, to generate sufficient funds from internal sources to finance a reasonable share of its investment requirements.  The project would include the provision of equipment, civil works and technical assistance for these purposes as well as consultants' services for preparation of subsequent network expansion to meet demand in the 1990s."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"24,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095103","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095103","DocDate":"30-NOV-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
