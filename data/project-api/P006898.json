The generating plant will consist of two 15 MW sets, with provisions for a plant expansion to a total of six 15 MW sets at a later date. A tailrace (760 meters in length approximately) will carry the waters from the power plant to the Reventazon river. The project includes an outdoor step-up substation adjacent to the power plant, outdoor step-down substations at Colima, Barranca, and La Garita, with some 80 kilometers of 138 KV single circuit transmission line. Additionally, diesel generating plants, consisting of two 4 MW sets, will be installed at the Colima station, another two 0.5 MW at Limon station, on the East Coast."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Costa Rica!$!CR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"8,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CR","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b0822b8ad2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0822b8ad2_1_0","DocDate":"03-FEB-1961"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b0822b8ad1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0822b8ad1_1_0","DocDate":"03-FEB-1961"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903461632","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903461632","DocDate":"02-FEB-1961"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902315795","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902315795","DocDate":"31-JAN-1961"}],"countryname":"Republic of Costa Rica"}},"facets":{}}
