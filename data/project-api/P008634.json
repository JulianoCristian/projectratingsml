It would also assist in upgrading teacher training and help increase farmers' skills. The project would include construction, furniture and/or equipment and technical assistance, as required, for forty-three science laboratories and vocational workshops in secondary schools; two agricultural and three industrial technician training institutes; seven primary teacher training institutes; seven farmer training centers and three demonstration farms; two mobile agricultural training units; a nutrition education program and an agricultural information center; and university faculties of agriculture, veterinary medicine, education, science and engineering. The project faces no undue risks.
