The project's specific objectives will be to effectively treat about 1.9 million TB cases; achieve a 85 percent cure rate in the revised strategy districts; provide treatment with daily short-course chemotherapy and conventional drugs; and improve diagnosis, patient registration, and monitoring of treatment completion and cure. To meet the stated objectives, the project will finance activities and inputs under three main components: (1) improving the quality, access, and outcomes of TB treatment; (2) developing institutional and operational research capacity and enhancing technical, managerial, and interpersonal skills; and (3) developing information, communication, and outreach activities, and promoting community involvement. Overall, the project will initiate a shift in the epidemiological profile of tuberculosis in India by focusing on the cure of infectious patients."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"sector4":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"142,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other industry"}],"docty":"Other Health Study,Other Health Study,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Project Information Document,Newsletter,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"YW,BC,BH,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"93,57,60,67","mjthemecode":"8,7,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Other Health Study (HLT),  Vol.1","DocType":"HLT","EntityID":"000333037_20141017162235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20141017162235","DocDate":"19-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Other Health Study (HLT),  Vol.2","DocType":"HLT","EntityID":"000333037_20141017163004","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20141017163004","DocDate":"19-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20060726101636","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060726101636","DocDate":"29-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000160016_20041007103349","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20041007103349","DocDate":"05-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185326","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185326","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Newsletter (NEWS),  Vol.1","DocType":"NEWS","EntityID":"000009265_3980804143352","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980804143352","DocDate":"31-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123433269","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123433269","DocDate":"14-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123433269","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123433269","DocURL":"14-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625093517","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625093517","DocDate":"06-JAN-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
