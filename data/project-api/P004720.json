Specifically, the project aims at raising the operational efficiency of PAT's Klong Toei facilities at Bangkok Port and at converting the ex-naval port of Sattahip for commercial use to handle the diverted traffic in excess of the capacity of the Klong Toei facilities. The physical improvements included in the project consist of: civil works at Klong Toei and Sattahip; mechanical equipment for both ports; floating equipment for Sattahip; and construction of container freight stations and bonded warehouses including procurement of mechanical equipment at Bang Su. The measures to improve operational efficiency at Klong Toei will consist of: reallocation of berths between conventional cargo and container ships; and streamlining cargo handling and container yard operating procedures. In addition the project will provide for technical assistance, training and financial studies to help improve PAT's organizational efficiency; and a study for the future development of ports on the Eastern Seaboard."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"47,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925052738","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925052738","DocDate":"15-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e95f2d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95f2d_1_0","DocDate":"18-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e95f2b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95f2b_1_0","DocDate":"18-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902362321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902362321","DocDate":"31-OCT-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191250428","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191250428","DocDate":"31-OCT-1980"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
