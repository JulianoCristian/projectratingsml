The project includes: studies for defining Portugal's needs for trained manpower of all types and levels of specialization up to 1990; for improving the teaching of science, technology and engineering; and for determining the ways and means of training health technicians. The project would consist of the construction, furnishing and equipping of educational and training institutions throughout the country, and the provision of 33 man-years of technical assistance (specialists) and 113 man-years of fellowships. Annual output from project institutions is anticipated to be about 2,000 senior- and middle-level managers, 2,400 technicians, 400 graduates from the vocational programs, and 1,700 teachers. The beneficiaries would come mainly from middle- and lower-income families, except in management training. The project faces no special risks."},"country_namecode":"Portuguese Republic!$!PT","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"21,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"PT","sectorcode":"ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925021306","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925021306","DocDate":"10-SEP-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902293449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902293449","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912331871","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912331871","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c6c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c6c_1_0","DocDate":"27-APR-1978"}],"countryname":"Portuguese Republic"}},"facets":{}}
