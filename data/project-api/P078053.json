The strategy is designed to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS infection, and mitigate the effects of the epidemic through prevention, and care treatment. The national strategic plan is multi-sectoral in nature, bringing together the efforts of government, civil society, private sector, and communities in a national campaign to slow the rate of infection and provide care for those who suffer from the disease. The project has five components. The community and civil society initiatives would empower communities to respond effectively to the HIV/AIDS epidemic; the capacity building for the civil society HIV/AIDS response will support efforts to create AIDS competent communities by improving skills, and increasing implementation capacity for the implementers, supporters, and target groups active under the community and civil society initiatives; the government multi-sector response will support ministries and subordinate institutions in the development and implementation of HIV/AIDS related programs directed toward their own personnel and; strengthening and scaling up health sector services for HIV/AIDS to provide technical leadership on treatment and care for people living with HIV/AIDS."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government
