There are four project components. The project is located in the Autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan and would constitute (i) improving the safe disposal of the drainage effluent discharged from a nearly 100,000 ha irrigated area in South Karakalpakstan; (ii) the rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage (I&D) infrastructure within this area, including the I&D systems serving the former sovkhoze and kolkhoze (FSKs) or shirkats, and also the I&D systems within the FSKs; (iii) the protection and enhancement of several wetlands and archaeological sites; and (iv) the establishment of water user associations (WUAs) to operate and maintain the I&D systems within the FSKs. The preparation of the next project will be supported under the project and will focus on the improvement of the drainage disposal systems in the Kashkadarya and Bukhara Vilayats."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uzbekistan!$!UZ","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration
