The project includes two major components: (a) a national component to assist in the institutional development of sector institutions, support the implementation of new sector policies, finance studies to prepare model contracting documents and develop a strategy to encourage private sector participation in the provision of water and sanitation services, and finance the preparation of a follow-up water pollution control project; and (b) a state and local component to help finance sector investments which focus on the poorer areas of the subproject cities. These investments involve rehabilitation and expansion of water supply and sanitation systems.  In addition, the loan will finance project engineering, and institutional strengthening of the operating agencies."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":13},"sector2":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":11},"sector3":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":47},"sector4":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":29},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"}],"docty":"Agreement,Project Completion Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"WA,WC,WS,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,71,40,84","mjthemecode":"11,4,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":11},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":47},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":29}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042911473196","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042911473196","DocDate":"29-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019143305","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019143305","DocDate":"22-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042013540897","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042013540897","DocDate":"18-JAN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041310243998","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041310243998","DocDate":"18-JAN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929134906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929134906","DocDate":"08-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929134719","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929134719","DocDate":"08-NOV-1990"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
