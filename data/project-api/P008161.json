Given the complexity inherent in health sector reforms and existing institutional constraints, the project focuses on a limited set of key and attainable objectives to lay the foundation for incremental and sustainable improvements. Its aims are twofold: 1) improve the efficiency and quality of services provided to the poor and uninsured by reducing the Public Health Ministry's (MSP) role in the direct provision of health services; and 2) establish the framework for the development of health sector institutions. To address these objectives the project comprises the following components: 1) The delegation of MSP's service delivery responsibilities will support the reduction of the MSP's role in the direct provision of services, promoting the gradual delegation of MSP service provision responsibilities to eligible entities, primarily in the private sector. 2) The insititutional development component will strengthen the sector's institutional capacity and management practices to support the gradual delegation of the MSP's service provision responsibilities. 3) The establishment of health sector disease priorities component will help adjust the health service model to the country's demographic and epidemiological profile. On the basis of global-burden-of-disease and related cost effectiveness analyses, the component will provide selective support to priority programs."},"country_namecode":"Oriental Republic of Uruguay!$!UY","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"15,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UY","sectorcode":"JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"67","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03012304060922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03012304060922","DocDate":"19-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200180346","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200180346","DocURL":"28-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200180145","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200180145","DocDate":"28-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200180145","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200180145","DocURL":"28-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200180346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200180346","DocDate":"28-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3de3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3de3_1_0","DocDate":"21-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007114417","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007114417","DocDate":"21-FEB-1995"}],"countryname":"Oriental Republic of Uruguay","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
