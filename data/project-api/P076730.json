The main reason for restructuring this investment is to improve the results framework in order to allow the Republic of Croatia (the borrower) to adequately assess the extent to which the project development objective (PDO) is being met. The restructuring also provides an opportunity to inform the Board of two additional changes to the project. First, funds of \u00801.5 million from the 'capacity building for cooperative development and Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) support services' under the economic revitalization subcomponent have been reallocated to another activity within the economic revitalization subcomponent because this capacity building has already been funded and implemented by the borrower, other donors, and the project implementation unit. This support has yielded positive results as SME, and cooperatives have so far demonstrated their capacity to prepare and implement good projects. The second change is the extension of the project closing date to June 30, 2010. The borrower requested an extension of the project closing date to facilitate the successful completion of community investment subprojects and to improve the monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Croatia!$!HR","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":32},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade
