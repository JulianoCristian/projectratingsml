There are five project components. The first supports drilling geothermal wells for production and re-injection to cover the base-load heat demand for the entire service area; constructs a geothermal district heating plant, an absorption heat pump plant, and a natural gas plant; and expanding the existing district heating infrastructure. The second component builds a new heat distribution network. The third component installs heat exchanges and meters in individual households and other buildings. The fourth component, the project management component, supports the institutional strengthening of the district heating enterprise(PEC/GP) with an emphasis on providing technical consultant services and specialized services such as financial management and auditing. The fifth component is aimed at monitoring and evaluating the global environmental benefits from the project, that is, making a credible assessment of carbon reductions, which in turn helps establish the potential for a broader introduction of geothermal district heating in Poland and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"38,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,84","mjthemecode":"11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00042605311474","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00042605311474","DocDate":"14-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00040503292925","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00040503292925","DocDate":"29-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99062306380547","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99062306380547","DocDate":"05-FEB-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland"}},"facets":{}}
