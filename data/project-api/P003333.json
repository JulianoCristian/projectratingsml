To achieve this goal, the project will provide critical programmatic and commodity support to the government's integrated and comprehensive program for prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The project focuses on strengthening detection and cure of STDs, one of the most cost-effective interventions to inhibit the spread of Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It also provides essential drugs and protective supplies to enable the health care system to manage the increased demands made by the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic. In particular, it will finance: (a) condoms to ensure that Information, Education and Communication efforts to change behavior and promote their use are accompanied by adequate supplies; (b) STE program support and drugs and diagnostic tests for STD control, one of the most cost-effective interventions to inhibit the spread of HIV and medically justifiable in its own right to prevent STD complications and congenital disease; (c) drugs to treat tuberculosis and other selected AIDS-opportunistic infections; (d) tests and supplies for HIV diagnosis and blood screening; and (e) protective supplies for health care givers - gloves, disinfectants, syringes."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zimbabwe!$!ZW","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"64,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ZW","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"88","mjthemecode":"8,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01070604165265","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01070604165265","DocDate":"13-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121174577","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121174577","DocDate":"14-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121174577","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121174577","DocURL":"14-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e125f8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e125f8_1_0","DocDate":"17-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004155203","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004155203","DocDate":"28-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004154502","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004154502","DocDate":"28-MAY-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zimbabwe"}},"facets":{}}
