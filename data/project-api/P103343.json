The additional grant will help finance a portion of the project cost overrun due to circumstances that have arisen during implementation. There will be no changes to the project's development objective, results framework and implementation arrangements. The target for length of tertiary rural roads rehabilitated has increased by 29 percent following detailed surveys of rehabilitation schemes during implementation. The project is co-financed by the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) grant TF95297 ($50 million). Additional financing in an amount of $30 million to cover the balance funding gap has been approved by ARTF on November 22, 2010."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of
