The project has four main components: 1) improvement of the trasmission in Northwest Luzon; 2) installation of a new National Load Dispatch Center (NLDC) including communications, metering, and protection equipment in Luzon and the Visayas; 3) reinforcement of the systems in Negros, Panay and Cebu ; and 4) provision of experts services and equipment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,78","mjthemecode":"10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040702133156","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040702133156","DocDate":"29-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123101803","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123101803","DocURL":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123101602","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123101602","DocURL":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123102104","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123102104","DocURL":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123102205","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123102205","DocURL":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123102406","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123102406","DocURL":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123102507","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123102507","DocURL":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029222551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029222551","DocDate":"20-FEB-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
