Besides, the project involves preparation of studies to identify and develop projects in labor intensive and export oriented industries in order to help KBP and IBT increase their future role in the promotion of such industries. The aggregate direct employment creation is expected to be about 10,000 jobs. Other objectives of the project are to contribute to the institution building of the borrowing banks, and to encourage joint ventures and cofinancing. The project also includes a technical assistance component of $670,000 ($400,000 for KBP and $270,000 for IBT), for preparation of above-mentioned studies, staff training, and procurement of office equipment. The risks associated with the loans relate to meeting the employment and export targets by beneficiary enterprises. However, provisions included under the loans and Yugoslavia's policies to foster industrial exports should reduce the risk to within acceptable limits."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"70,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925051722","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925051722","DocDate":"03-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a0c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a0c_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUL-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a0b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a0b_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUL-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a0a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a0a_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUL-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101245","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101245","DocDate":"30-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901014272","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901014272","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
