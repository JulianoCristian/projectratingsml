The APL further improves the quality of its compensatory programs, continues its policies to redress inequities in the sector, continues to decentralize, and provides a smooth transition across presidential administrations. There are two projects components. The first improves quality in basic education by 1) carrying out in-service training of teachers, principals, supervisors, and other administrative staff; 2) strengthening school-based management at the local community and school association levels; 3) strengthening supervision; and 4) building and rehabilitating school infrastructure as well as providing equipment and teaching aids. The second component strengthens institutional capacity at the federal level by strengthening the national evaluation system, implementing a regional planning exercise, and setting up pilot programs for migrant children, for children aged 9-14 in urban marginal areas, and for indigenous children in regular schools. It also helps states implement their institutional development proposals and other state-generated initiatives."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":53},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"115,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BC,BH,ES,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"65,60,71,57,78","mjthemecode":"10,7,9,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":53},{"Name":"Education","Percent":21},{"Name":"Education","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03051604030480","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03051604030480","DocDate":"31-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200371334","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200371334","DocURL":"04-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200371736","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200371736","DocURL":"04-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200371635","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200371635","DocURL":"04-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061016223080","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061016223080","DocDate":"26-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101045","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101045","DocDate":"31-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980625101658","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980625101658","DocDate":"07-MAY-1998"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
