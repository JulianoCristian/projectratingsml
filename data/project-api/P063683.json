Three changes are proposed: (i) capital restructuring of ATI; (ii) expansion of product lines offered; and (iii) consolidation of the existing individual IDA projects under a single project number. These modifications (i and ii) will help solidify ATI's capacity to deliver on its mandate to facilitate productive trade and investment for member states while the third proposed change (iii) will realign World Bank processes to ensure a regional approach to development."},"country_namecode":"Africa!$!3A","sector1":{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"International financial architecture","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance"}],"docty":"Project Paper,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"3A","sectorcode":"FD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Trade and integration","Trade and integration","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"47,45,46,49","mjthemecode":"5,5,5,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","code":"FD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"International financial architecture","code":"46"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000090341_20061207095946","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061207095946","DocDate":"06-DEC-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000021321_2010063016091160","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010063016091160","DocDate":"08-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01032006582816","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032006582816","DocDate":"12-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00121301580330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121301580330","DocDate":"18-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00121301580331","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121301580331","DocDate":"10-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99032505583774","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99032505583774","DocDate":"01-AUG-2000"}],"countryname":"Africa"}},"facets":{}}
