It also intends to strengthen instruction in science and mathematics in general education, and increase the number of graduates qualified to enter higher scientific and technological studies.  The project aims to accomplish this by assisting 140 secondary and 30 primary schools to modernize the curricula through the use of computers as instructional tools for the teaching of mathematics, science and language skills, and for developing computer literacy.  The proposed project will assist Portugal in its human resource development strategy to meet ongoing structural changes in the economy and enhance its competitiveness within the European Community (EC)."},"country_namecode":"Portuguese Republic!$!PT","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PT","sectorcode":"EY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other education","code":"EY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019223603","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019223603","DocDate":"19-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926054820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926054820","DocDate":"25-JUN-1987"}],"countryname":"Portuguese Republic"}},"facets":{}}
