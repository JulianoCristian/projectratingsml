There are two main components. The first component finances road maintenance, rehabilitation, and safety improvements for the main and regional road network, including about 280 km of priority road sections in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and about 290 km of priority road sections in the Republic of Srpska. The second component finances the institutional strengthening of the two road directorates (FBHRD and RSRD), including setting up of road and bridge data banks, introducing the use of the Highway Development Model (HDM) for setting road maintenance priorities, supervision for civil works, the use of competitive bidding procedures, familiarization with modern road maintenance technologies, improved financial management systems, establishing environmental units in each of the Road Directorates and to support these units in implementing their Environmental Management Plans (EMPs), staff training, and audits of the project accounts. This component also includes a program of technical support for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Road Infrastructure Public Corporation (BRIC), including establishing improved and uniform road and bridge design, maintenance and construction standards, creation of a road safety database, and conducting safety awareness campaigns."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BA","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,71,44,78","mjthemecode":"10,4,9,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":85},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080321031419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080321031419","DocDate":"10-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201283545","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201283545","DocURL":"18-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201283646","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201283646","DocDate":"18-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201283545","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201283545","DocDate":"18-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201283444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201283444","DocDate":"18-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201283444","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201283444","DocURL":"18-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201283646","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201283646","DocURL":"18-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02031304003781","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02031304003781","DocDate":"28-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_01120704073750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01120704073750","DocDate":"03-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0109130401335","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0109130401335","DocDate":"31-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01041102153243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01041102153243","DocDate":"01-OCT-2001"}],"countryname":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}},"facets":{}}
