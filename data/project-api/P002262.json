GDP has declined since then due to low coffee prices and poor weather. The objective of this project is to promote swift growth of the Rwandan private sector. The private sector is considered a key element in a strategy for growth and diversification. The project will promote efforts to ensure that the private sector has access to investment financing and managerial and technical support. It will also support efforts to improve the legal and regulatory environment and enhance the investment and export incentives. The three components of the project which will aid in achieving these goals include: line of credit; private sector support fund; and institutional strengthening. The Rwandan government believes that growth led by the private sector can provide employment and make a significant contribution to export earnings. The project is a complement to Rwanda's macroeconomic adjustment program already in place."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":83},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"FA,BG,BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Economic management","Rule of law","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"45,32,23,44,40","mjthemecode":"4,4,1,3,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":83},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01103104010780","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01103104010780","DocDate":"31-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121190702","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121190702","DocURL":"18-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121190803","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121190803","DocDate":"18-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121184701","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121184701","DocDate":"18-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121184701","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121184701","DocURL":"18-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121190803","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121190803","DocURL":"18-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121190702","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121190702","DocDate":"18-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b561_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b561_1_0","DocDate":"09-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1a4ae_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1a4ae_1_0","DocDate":"09-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004030225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004030225","DocDate":"18-AUG-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda"}},"facets":{}}
