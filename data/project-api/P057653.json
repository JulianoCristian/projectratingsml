It is to help the Ministry of Education improve Brazil's education performance by assisting the states and municipalities in the poorest regions of the country, the northeast, north, and center-west reduce the educational inequalities in their systems, and increase the effectiveness of their schools so that all children in these regions can successfully complete the eighth grade, the final year of the compulsory \"fundamental\" cycle. Fundescola III helps local governments integrate school improvement reforms into their structures and routines. There are four project components. The first provides some additional assistance to schools that had begun to introduce Fundescola's schooling improvement reforms consolidate these reforms under the responsibility and support of their Secretariats of Education. Second, the project will help hundreds of local governments expand these reforms into thousands of additional schools. Third, the project will develop and use a new set of teaching/learning models, in addition to Escola Ativa and Gestar, for diverse types of schools and population groups. Finally, Fundescola III builds the capacity of local governments to support continuous improvement in schooling quality, and promote the financial, administrative, and managerial permanence of these reforms. Fundescola III will be implemented in two phases, this being the first phase."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of
