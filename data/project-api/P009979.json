Underpinning India's broad drive to achieve economic growth, the project also aims to increase domestic supplies of coal. The project will consist of (a) an investment component - high return and quick disbursing investments to maintain or improve the profitability of the 24 existing mine sub-projects; and (b) an assistance and training component - a study of the rules and regulations governing the coal industry, in light of the Government's decision to open up the coal sector to private investors; and technical assistance to support India's institutional capacity development in project implementation and mining operations and management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Mining and other extractive","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"532,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Mining and other extractive"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Inspection Panel Notice of Registration,Guarantee Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BC,LB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,44","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Mining and other extractive","code":"LB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0206180402433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0206180402433","DocDate":"28-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Inspection Panel Notice of Registration (IPNR),  Vol.1","DocType":"IPNR","EntityID":"000265513_20040311172948","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000265513_20040311172948","DocDate":"22-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123452348","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123452348","DocURL":"19-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052610321249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052610321249","DocDate":"19-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040611513350","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040611513350","DocDate":"19-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123452348","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123452348","DocDate":"19-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123452147","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123452147","DocURL":"19-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123452147","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123452147","DocDate":"19-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903312499","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903312499","DocDate":"23-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170912","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170912","DocDate":"31-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145939","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145939","DocDate":"30-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145937","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145937","DocDate":"30-APR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
