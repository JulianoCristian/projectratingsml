To meet these objectives, the project will provide the Government with technical assistance in the form of consulting services and training to prepare the necessary legal, regulatory, institutional and sectoral reforms in the electricity and telecommunications sectors; define reform implementation; and prepare the privatization of specific activities whenever feasible."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"Power","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Technical Annex","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"BG,CT,LD,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,34,43","mjthemecode":"4,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":42},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":34},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20081121005723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20081121005723","DocDate":"22-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123062343","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123062343","DocDate":"10-FEB-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123062343","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123062343","DocURL":"10-FEB-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d69_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d69_1_0","DocDate":"13-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005230642","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005230642","DocDate":"22-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961007175600","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007175600","DocDate":"22-NOV-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
