The program of poverty reduction support credits is anchored on an ambitious Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), published by the Armenian authorities in late 2003, laying out a comprehensive program stretched over a decade for sustaining high rates of growth and directing public resources sharply towards fighting poverty. Central to this strategy are improvements in core public sector functions and higher investments in human capital and infrastructure, whilst maintaining macroeconomic stability."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Armenia!$!AM","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":29},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Aviation","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":14},"sector5":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"18,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Aviation"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"AM","sectorcode":"AT,CT,TV,BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"28,40,38,82,21","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"1,11,4,4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Aviation","code":"TV"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":29},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":29},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":14},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":14},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20091016021917","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20091016021917","DocDate":"21-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010060410143096","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010060410143096","DocDate":"29-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000020439_20071217083751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20071217083751","DocDate":"29-OCT-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20071029144604","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20071029144604","DocDate":"29-OCT-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20070305121456","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20070305121456","DocDate":"22-JAN-2007"}],"countryname":"Republic of Armenia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
