The project comprises the following two components. The first component is a Fellowships and Training Component which consists of three subcomponents which will provide domestic and overseas degree and non-degree fellowships to professional, managerial, and science and technology staff of key government ministries and agencies at national and local levels; overseas fellowships in appropriate professional, managerial and technical subjects not yet available in Indonesia; improve reentry procedures for the utilization of past, present and future fellowship holders; and facilitate overseas degree and non-degree programs of private and public firms by making available such services as testing, placement and monitoring. The second component will assist the National Steering Team for Overseas Training (NASTOT) in playing a more effective role in formulating policy, coordinating and monitoring the civil service fellowships and the pilot programs for fresh graduates, and undertaking the studies to lead to development of a possible new merit-based fellowship scheme."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":47},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":16},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"69,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BH,BC,ET,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"66,59,26,25","mjthemecode":"2,2,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":47},{"Name":"Education","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":16},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070314103246","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070314103246","DocDate":"01-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123063048","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123063048","DocURL":"11-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123062947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123062947","DocDate":"11-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123062947","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123062947","DocURL":"11-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123063048","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123063048","DocDate":"11-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d75_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d75_1_0","DocDate":"15-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007044430","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007044430","DocDate":"08-NOV-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
