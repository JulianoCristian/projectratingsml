The project consists of three components. First, integrated community child care package will improve parental awareness on child care and development through parental education, child growth monitoring and promotion, training, and sensitization. Second, community support grants for child development will provide a) community support grants, which finance construction and operation of child care centers, or the production and marketing of weaning foods; and b) innovation grants, which support communities in implementing \"innovative ideas\" on improving the lives of children within their communities. Third, national program support for child development and nutrition will support program monitoring and evaluation; preventive program initiatives on micronutrients; early childhood development curriculum development; training; and information, education, and communications (IEC) for children's rights."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"34,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"BC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"68,63,57,59","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,7,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":65},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":31},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080616040602","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080616040602","DocDate":"21-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110433","DocDate":"15-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182926","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182926","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
