In addition, the project would assist efforts to stimulate additional demand for family planning and to extend essential and affordable health care to Bangladesh's rural population. The project, which would continue support to activities begun under the first and second population projects, would consist of seven components: (i) expansion and consolidation of family planning service delivery; (ii) implementation of MCH programs; (iii) strenghtening of communications and public education; (iv) assistance to women's programs; (v) support to non-government organizations and innovative activities; (vi) research and evaluation; (vii) project management support."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Targeted health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"78,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Targeted health"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"HT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Targeted health","code":"HT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36ac1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36ac1_1_0","DocDate":"14-JAN-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094327","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094327","DocDate":"31-DEC-1985"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
