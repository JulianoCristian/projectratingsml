The project's construction and main road network maintenance components pose no special risks. Improving road maintenance at the level of the three provinces gives rise to some uncertainties owing to the presently low administrative and technical capacity of the three provincial highway authorities. To minimize this risk: (i) the Ministry of Public Works and Communications (MOP) and the provincial councils would sign comprehensive Maintenance Agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, whereby MOP would provide, inter alia, technical assistance (supported by consultants) and supervision necessary to carry out the maintenance works; (ii) the Bank and the Government would annually review with each province the adequacy and performance of the staffing provided by MOP and the province; and (iii) experienced MOP staff (with the help of consultants) would train provincial personnel in maintenance activities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"55,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925043831","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925043831","DocDate":"22-JAN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902354862","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902354862","DocDate":"30-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912493489","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912493489","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
