PRSO-5 will contribute to the achievement of these objectives through improving management of key areas (regional integration, private sector development, and quality of investment in natural resource sector) and through strengthening of public financial management and service delivery capacities and targeted poverty reduction programs. The PRSO program squarely supports the four pillars of the CAS: (i) sustain growth through improved management of key drivers - regional integration and private sector development, rural development, and natural resource management; (ii) improve social outcomes and reduce vulnerability through strengthened public financial management and service delivery capacities and targeted poverty reduction programs; (iii) adopt a strategic approach to capacity development and partnership in support of better NSEDP results; and (iv) support the implementation of Second Nam Theun (NT2) hydro-power project, focusing on the revenue management arrangements. PRSO-supported reforms are timely for improving the public financial management framework, as significant resources will accrue to the Government from the NT2 project and other natural resource sector developments."},"country_namecode":"Lao People's Democratic Republic!$!LA","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":52},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Hydropower","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":16},"theme5":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Hydropower"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"LA","sectorcode":"EZ,FA,LH,JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Human development","Human development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"25,67,65,27,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,8,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Hydropower","code":"LH"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":52},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":12},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":12},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":12},{"Name":"Education","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20121219011444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20121219011444","DocDate":"05-OCT-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010041915352894","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010041915352894","DocDate":"09-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000350881_20090818105113","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20090818105113","DocDate":"06-AUG-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20081203135122","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20081203135122","DocDate":"11-NOV-2008"}],"countryname":"Lao People's Democratic Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
