The objective of the second PFDPL is to support the reform actions in three policy areas: (i) enhancing business enabling environment to encourage new private sector investments; (ii) strengthening financial discipline by enforcing hard budget constraints and continued reform of enterprise sector and public utilities; and (iii) building a more efficient and stable financial sector through continued restructuring of state holdings in banking and insurance sectors, enhancing crisis preparedness, and encouraging development of the capital markets. Additionally, the reforms supported under second PFDPL are supposed to increase the Government of Serbia (GoS) capacity in weathering the current global economic crisis. To this end, the second PFDPL supports a number of precautionary measures aimed at enhancing crisis preparedness, including adoption of liquidity framework, assessment of capital adequacy, enhancement of bank resolution framework, and strengthening of deposit insurance payout functions. It is expected that the upcoming third PFDPL will further contribute to strengthening Serbia's banking sector by providing support to implementation of the recommendations of the planned Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Serbia!$!YF","sector1":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Capital markets"},{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Program Document,Loan Agreement,Program Information Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"YF","sectorcode":"LZ,FK,BC,YZ,FZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,43","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":30},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":10},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20110801003551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110801003551","DocDate":"17-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20100128235605","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100128235605","DocDate":"26-JAN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010081315345712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010081315345712","DocDate":"18-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090710145351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090710145351","DocDate":"09-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090710145454","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090710145454","DocDate":"05-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000356161_20090716012335","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20090716012335","DocDate":"15-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090616123504","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090616123504","DocDate":"15-MAY-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Serbia"}},"facets":{}}
