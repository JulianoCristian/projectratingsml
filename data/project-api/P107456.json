This restructuring request does not involve: a) revisions to the Project Development Objectives (PDOs); b) closing date extension; but does include c) a minor revision to the results. The forecasted end of project target value for the key performance indicator 'increase the number of SMEs that compete for contracts through the public procurement process' is being revised downwards, from '80' to '30'. SMEs participation in public procurement activities is a relatively new area and the original final target value is deemed to be very ambitious. This change will require revisions to the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework in the project operating manual."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cabo Verde!$!CV","sector1":{"Name":"SME
