Project subloans would be provided by ABC to individual farmers and households, collective units, and enterprises owned by local government entities and collectives in the two provinces of Fujian and Hunan to finance investments for the development of aquaculture, orchards, agroprocessing and livestock enterprises. A technical assistance component is included to effectively implement the project and to strengthen the operations of ABC. At full development, the value of the incremental output from the project would be about US$140 million p.a. The project would benefit directly some 16,000 families from increased production and incomes, and generate additional employment equivalent to 61,000 full time jobs."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u7b2c\u4e8c\u519c\u6751\u4fe1\u8d37\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u52a0\u5927\u4e16\u884c\u96c6\u56e2\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u8d37\u6b3e\u7684\u652f\u6301\u529b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u519c\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u52a0\u5de5\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5df2\u7531\u5728\u5efa\u7b2c\u4e00\u519c\u6751\u4fe1\u8d37\u9879\u76ee\uff08\u8d37\u6b3e\u53f71462-CHA\uff09\u542f\u52a8\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u5b50\u8d37\u6b3e\u5c06\u7531\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u5411\u798f\u5efa\u548c\u6e56\u5357\u4e24\u7701\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u519c\u6237\u3001\u96c6\u4f53\u5355\u4f4d\u548c\u5730\u65b9\u653f\u5e9c\u90e8\u95e8\u6240\u5c5e\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u52a9\u6c34\u4ea7\u517b\u6b96\u3001\u679c\u6811\u79cd\u690d\u3001\u519c\u4ea7\u54c1\u52a0\u5de5\u548c\u755c\u7267\u4f01\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u6240\u9700\u6295\u8d44\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u8bbe\u6709\u6280\u672f\u63f4\u52a9\u5b50\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5176\u5b97\u65e8\u662f\u63a8\u52a8\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u5b8c\u5168\u5c55\u5f00\u4e4b\u65f6\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u5e74\u5ea6\u65b0\u589e\u4ea7\u503c\u5c06\u8fbe\u52301.4\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u5de6\u53f3\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4ea7\u91cf\u548c\u6536\u5165\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u76f4\u63a5\u60e0\u53ca1.6\u4e07\u519c\u6237\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c06\u65b0\u589e6.1\u4e07\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u5c31\u4e1a\u5c97\u4f4d\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925232402","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925232402","DocDate":"07-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36aa9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36aa9_1_0","DocDate":"17-DEC-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36aa7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36aa7_1_0","DocDate":"17-DEC-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094235","DocDate":"30-NOV-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095612","DocDate":"30-NOV-1985"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
