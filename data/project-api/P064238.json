These actions include: 1) voluntary out-migration assistance schemes for people whose economic prospects are limited; and 2) measures that will allow municipalities to realize potential economic benefits resulting from a decreased population. Beside a project management component, there are four main components: 1) The Migration Assistance Component facilitates the out-migration of specific groups of population in the participating regions. Allowances are given for housing and transport of household belongings and plane/train tickets. 2) The Local Restructuring Support Component provides technical assistance to help participating municipalities to reduce their dilapidated and unused housing stock, and implements reforms in housing and utility services management. 3) The Monitoring and Evaluation Component monitors the process, and evaluates the economic outcomes of restructuring, social aspects of out-migration, and the evaluation and dissemination of project outcomes. 4) The Federal Component helps introduce regulatory procedures aimed at gradually deregulating the Northern economy."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":88},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"BH,BC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Economic management","Urban development"],"themecode":"73,24,61,51","mjthemecode":"6,7,1,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":88},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20100719000542","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100719000542","DocDate":"21-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20090622000529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090622000529","DocDate":"13-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201481681","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201481681","DocURL":"11-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201481681","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201481681","DocDate":"11-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01051904010040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01051904010040","DocDate":"04-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00021605302421","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00021605302421","DocDate":"08-FEB-2000"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
