It also seeks to promote system reliability and performance through the rehabilitation of deteriorating facilities and by improvements in their operation and maintenance.  To this end, the project, to be carried out over eight years supports several components.  They include water supply rehabilitation, water importation improvements, sewerage rehabilitation, acquisition of various equipment and a comprehensive program of technical assistance and training. Under the proposed project, increasing efficiency and cost savings will accrue along with improved water quality, as well as better water supply and sewerage service.  A well-functioning water supply and sewerage system is vital to the health of the population and of the tourism industry, on which the economy of the Bahamas is critically dependent."},"country_namecode":"Commonwealth of The Bahamas!$!BS","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BS","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029222756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029222756","DocDate":"26-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702134538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702134538","DocDate":"30-SEP-1986"}],"countryname":"Commonwealth of The Bahamas"}},"facets":{}}
