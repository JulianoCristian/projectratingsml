Priority would be given to areas not previously serviced by the government, newly accessible areas (those which were under rebel control until January, 2002), and the most vulnerable population groups within those areas. There are three project components. The first, the Community-Driven Program (CDP), restores social and economic infrastructure and services in war-affected communities using community mobilization and collective action to select, implement and maintain small-scale sub-projects. The second component (a) rehabilitates basic chiefdom and district feeder roads, drainage systems and other infrastructure through a public works program that employs demobilized soldiers, unemployed youths and other vulnerable groups; and (b) constructs shelter for poor and vulnerable families in newly accessible areas. The third component funds project Management and innovative activities, specifically (a) capacity building for communities, chiefdoms, and district authorities; (b) IEC activities; (c) monitoring and evaluation at the community, district, regional and central levels; (d) technical assistance for social assessments, beneficiary assessments, risk and vulnerability work, micro-finance, financial and technical audits, participatory poverty assessments (PPAs), environmental studies, and participatory monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Sierra
