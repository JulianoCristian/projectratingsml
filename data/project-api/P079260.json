The schools development grants component would help increase student enrollment, attendance, and retention in primary and secondary education, targeting this funding through Kosovo's municipalities. Selected schools (on the basis of documented problems in school access, and retention) will receive technical assistance (TA), and training in the area of school development planning, while grants finance will also cover community outreach, educational materials, and security activities in the educational environment. Auditing of the school grants program will be conducted annually. The improvement of the education management information system (EMIS) will be strengthened, specifically, EMIS will help monitor school enrollment, attendance, retention or dropout, and completion, including accountability for children in targeted municipalities, not participating in the school system. For this purpose, TA, external training, and necessary equipment supply for municipal, and central offices, will be financed. Project management includes monitoring and evaluation of the school development grants results, further TA, limited computer and office equipment, and staff training."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kosovo!$!XK","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":38},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":38},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":19},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"4,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"XK","sectorcode":"BC,BH,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Human development"],"themecode":"65,73,59,57,55","mjthemecode":"6,7,7,9,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":38},{"Name":"Education","Percent":38},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070720094748","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070720094748","DocDate":"29-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03042604002460","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03042604002460","DocDate":"14-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02101704195579","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02101704195579","DocDate":"21-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02101004015868","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02101004015868","DocDate":"04-MAR-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kosovo"}},"facets":{}}
