The project will assist the Government to: (a) support changes in policies, regulations, and investment programs, to provide a coherent incentives framework for the sustainable development of Mato Grosso; (b) guarantee conservation of the rich biodiversity of the state, while creating the basis for sustainable utilization of its renewable natural resources for direct economic benefit of the local population; (c) develop integrated agro-forestry farming systems in areas suitable for permanent agriculture; and (d) consolidate the technical operational capacity of state institutions, particularly those responsible for management of natural resources support services, the protection and management of forests and indigenous reserves, and agricultural services.  The main impact of the project will be a significant reduction in the rate of destruction of Mato Grosso's remaining natural rain forest and effective conservation of biodiversity protection of the
