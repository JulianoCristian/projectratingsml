The changes in project scope and components are required due to the challenging political and security conditions in the country after project effectiveness. As a result of this context, implementation was significantly delayed, and the number of project sites was reduced. The restructuring will result in cancellation of US$2.7 million of the grant proceeds and reallocation of the remaining amount to the revised activities. This restructuring will require an extension of the project closing date to June 30, 2010, as agreed with the Ministry of Health (MOH). The project development objective (PDO) has been revised, as follows: to improve access of the disabled population in the targeted areas in Iraq to rehabilitation and prosthetic services. This will be carried out by: (i) constructing new facilities and workshops and equipping them; (ii) upgrading technical skills of the service providers; and (iii) providing medical aids to the disabled persons. The restructured project is expected to result in: (a) an increase in the number of disabled using the newly constructed and equipped facilities, and (b) an increase in the number of disabled who will receive medical aids."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Iraq!$!IQ","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"17,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Project Paper,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Technical Annex,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"IQ","sectorcode":"JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"58,89,56","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":50},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20111007030324","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20111007030324","DocDate":"25-JUL-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011032614592290","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011032614592290","DocDate":"26-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011011118333499","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011011118333499","DocDate":"11-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000356161_20110118235109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110118235109","DocDate":"31-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000334955_20090804015225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090804015225","DocDate":"15-JAN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000021321_2010051811052401","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010051811052401","DocDate":"23-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000310607_20060810160343","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20060810160343","DocDate":"23-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20051212094130","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051212094130","DocDate":"15-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20051103124501","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20051103124501","DocDate":"23-SEP-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of Iraq","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
