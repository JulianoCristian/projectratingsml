The credit will finance (a) sub-loans for equipment and permanent working capital; (b) a special capital fund for providing supplementary financing to selected projects for which the sponsors are unable to provide sufficient equity; (c) a pilot cottage industry component for jute and cane/bamboo handicrafts; and (d) technical assistance to strengthen BSCIC's promotion and extension work. The risk relates to the limited experience of commercial banks in financing fixed investments for SCIs and of BSCIC in promotion and extension. Therefore, the project incorporates clearly defined criteria for project selection and supervision, tasks involved in promotion and extension, and technical assistance in aspects requiring improvement."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"7,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"DS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Private Sector Development","code":"DX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","code":"DS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b082228c10_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c10_1_0","DocDate":"06-APR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b082228c0f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c0f_1_0","DocDate":"06-APR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b082228c0e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c0e_1_0","DocDate":"06-APR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c0c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c0c_1_0","DocDate":"06-APR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190231056","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190231056","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912324266","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912324266","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
