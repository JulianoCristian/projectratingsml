While SAPP II will work mainly with government, it will also strengthen and finance nongovernmental organization (NGO) and private sector efforts through fostering partnerships and establishing funding and communication mechanisms to directly support these efforts. There are four components: 1) The Program Support component provides time-slice financing for each of the total subprograms based on these agreements. Support builds government capacity for joint planning, monitoring, and implementing of social service programs with civil society in the sectors of health (including reproductive health), education, and rural water supply and sanitation. 2) The Participatory Development component decentralizes decisionmaking and resource management; and strengthens management capacity at the district and community levels and beneficiary participation. 3) The Coordination, Monitoring, and Evaluation component strengthens government's monitoring and analytic capacity at the federal and provincial levels. 4) Technical Assistance and Institutional Capacity Development is made available to central and implementing line departments involved in the social action program as a fourth component."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":59},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":8},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"BC,BH,WZ,JA,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,65,67,56","mjthemecode":"6,8,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":59},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":19},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030627163906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030627163906","DocDate":"25-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123482872","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123482872","DocURL":"28-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123483879","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123483879","DocURL":"28-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123483073","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123483073","DocURL":"28-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110502","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110502","DocDate":"27-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101056","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101056","DocDate":"31-OCT-1995"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
