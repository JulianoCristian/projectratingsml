There are four project components. The first creates a leaner and highly motivated public service that is better equipped to deliver services to the public by improving pay and benefits; developing a contributary superanuation scheme and new medical insurance scheme; integrating the performance and appraisal schemes; rationalizing services; and integrating payroll and personnel databases. The second component enhances accountability, transparency, and efficiency in the procurement of goods and services. The third component reforms the legal framework by easing the registration and retrieval processes and improving law reporting. The fourth component provides project coordination and supports change management for the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"BG,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Rule of law","Rule of law"],"themecode":"32,33,27,29","mjthemecode":"2,2,3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070705100524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070705100524","DocDate":"31-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01072004141440","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072004141440","DocDate":"06-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00080305413989","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00080305413989","DocDate":"24-NOV-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
