It would also provide poles, bamboo, small timber, fodder grass, fruits, oilseeds, and other forest produce from these same plantations, introduce energy-efficient stoves, generate paid employment for the rural poor, help to stabilize the environment, and establish the Social Forestry Wing of the State Forestry Department. Potential project risks are that the free distribution of seedlings might lead to some waste, that village panchayats might lack sufficient leadership and incentive to assume responsibility for village woodlots, and that there might be resistance to the introduction of a new type of stove. These risks would be minimized by the careful monitoring and supervision of planting programs, and public information and education efforts."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"29,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925081313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925081313","DocDate":"30-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04319_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04319_1_0","DocDate":"06-OCT-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04317_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04317_1_0","DocDate":"06-OCT-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902381673","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902381673","DocDate":"30-SEP-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912542268","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912542268","DocDate":"30-SEP-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
