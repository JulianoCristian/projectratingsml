The project has three components.  The principal component is technology generation through research.  Research areas include: crop improvement, livestock management, forestry and natural resources.  The second component is technology transfer through extension. Activities include on-farm trials to validate promising technologies, staff training, and soil conservation.  The last component involves institutional development of the National Institute for Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research (INIFAP).  This component will improve the institutional capacity of INIFAP, assist in mobilizing resources via cost recovery, promote work on environmental and sector productivity issues, and broaden the intellectual base of agricultural research."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":89},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,78","mjthemecode":"10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":89},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122510040","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122510040","DocURL":"17-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122510141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122510141","DocDate":"17-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122505739","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122505739","DocURL":"17-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122505739","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122505739","DocDate":"17-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122510141","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122510141","DocURL":"17-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122510040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122510040","DocDate":"17-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001171507","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001171507","DocDate":"13-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001171753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001171753","DocDate":"13-APR-1992"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
