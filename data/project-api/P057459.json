The components will: 1) strengthen the management capacity of the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food (SAGPyA), particularly those functions required under the Quota Management System, including identification of service requirements, and cost effective mechanisms for service delivery. Local, and foreign technical assistance (TA) will be financed to review key functional responsibilities, and propose institutional, and operational modifications, including provision of equipment, and training needs; 2) strengthen monitoring, control and surveillance functions of SAGPyA, through: the development of license, and quota registry; improved fisheries inspection services; and, a pilot on-board observer program to address research needs. Information, and communication systems will be developed, supported by improved hardware/software infrastructure; 3) pilot social assistance action centers for unemployed fisheries workers, assessing existing labor programs, targeting vulnerable industry workers in coordination with cooperatives, unions, and industry as a whole; and, 4) provide administrative support for project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"JB,BC,AJ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"29,54,76,48","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"5,10,6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":80},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000012009_20030514135353","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030514135353","DocDate":"30-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00100705334841","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00100705334841","DocDate":"14-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9906030854599","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9906030854599","DocDate":"30-APR-1999"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
