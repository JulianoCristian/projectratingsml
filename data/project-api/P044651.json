The project comprises two components: (1) Infrastructure strengthening studies, including a feasibility study and environmental impact assessment to determine design and construction standards for road rehabilitation and upgrading, followed by detailed engineering designs for civil works; and a national bridge condition and structural strength survey to develop a prioritized program of bridge works. (2) Institutional strengthening, including technical assistance and training for RTCD personnel in contract administration organization, systems and procedures; hands-on training to upgrade mechanical skills, including spare parts for the training program; training of trainers (both in-house and overseas); and construction of a small training facility and workshop, including basic workshop equipment and training aides."},"country_namecode":"State of Eritrea!$!ER","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":31},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"6,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"ER","sectorcode":"TA,BC,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,44,74,78","mjthemecode":"10,9,4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":35},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":34},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":31}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03012304083925","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03012304083925","DocDate":"18-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184229","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184229","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123434679","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123434679","DocURL":"24-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123434679","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123434679","DocDate":"24-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145831","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145831","DocDate":"13-MAR-1997"}],"countryname":"State of Eritrea"}},"facets":{}}
