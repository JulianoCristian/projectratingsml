The DPL will support government priorities established in the climate change adaptation and water sector agenda. Mexico has emerged as a global climate change leader and is moving quickly to prepare mitigation and adaptation policies to tackle the most pressing issues that affect the country's main economic sectors. Mexico's role as a leader will be in the spotlight during the Sixteenth Conference of the Parties (COP 16), to be held in Mexico at the end of 2010. The operation represents a further step in the country's engagement in climate change and its impact on the hydrological cycle, a process that is expected to intensify over the course of this century. This operation supports the strengthening of the institutional, normative, regulatory and financial frameworks as a means to foster adaptation to climate change in the water sector. Measures and tools whose aim is to ensure water security through proper regulations, norms, institutional reforms and financial mechanisms are key to addressing this core development challenge and ensuring long-term sustainable growth in Mexico."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":84},"sector2":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":72},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"450,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Information Document,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"AT,WZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,85,82","mjthemecode":"11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":84},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000445729_20130712125033","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130712125033","DocDate":"27-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081856003_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081856003_1_0","DocDate":"02-JAN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012040416513164","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012040416513164","DocDate":"04-APR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011052118144766","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011052118144766","DocDate":"21-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081af3905_2_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081af3905_2_0","DocDate":"21-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100512140035","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100512140035","DocDate":"11-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100520020902","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100520020902","DocDate":"06-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100303092919","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100303092919","DocDate":"03-MAR-2010"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
