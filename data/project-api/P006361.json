Simultaneously, it will contract the supply of official (interest rate-controlled) credit to the agricultural sector. Under the project, bank loans will be used by the Government to refinance subloans made by participating banks to farmers and farm contractors to finance the latter's investment and working capital requirements. Unlike the administrative allocation of official rural credit to particular crops, regions or groups of producers, the application of project funds will be determined by market demand based on producers' estimates of returns on investments."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007203739","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007203739","DocDate":"29-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031610243490","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031610243490","DocDate":"31-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926200851","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926200851","DocDate":"23-MAY-1988"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
