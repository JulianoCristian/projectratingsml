This will be the third extension for a cumulative period of five years. This time is required to finalize implementation of key project activities and to allow for full achievement of the project's development objectives: to improve transparency and support modernization of the Treasury. Although the project is in its ninth year, it has been impacted by two primary causes: 1) Kyrgyzstan has undergone two significant political upheavals causing complete changes in government; and 2) as a result of the political instability, tendering documents for a major component of the project, the acquisition and implementation of an integrated financial management information system (FMIS), were significantly delayed."},"country_namecode":"Kyrgyz Republic!$!KG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management
