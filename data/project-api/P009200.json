The proposed facilities would provide sufficient water for the rapidly growing population as well as for the industries up to 1995. The project consists of construction of a pipeline, water treatment plant, pumping stations, reservoirs, and distribution network for the two communes. It further includes implementation of a leak detection program, provision of water meters and a meter repair facility, and construction and equipment of a technical operations building. Technical assistance will be provided to RWB in supervision of construction and in preparation of final designs for sewage collection systems. A total of 345 man-months of consulting services at an estimated average cost of US$7,900 per man-month is required."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"41,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e976d8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976d8_1_0","DocDate":"10-NOV-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e976d7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976d7_1_0","DocDate":"10-NOV-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902382489","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902382489","DocDate":"31-OCT-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912543695","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912543695","DocDate":"30-SEP-1981"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
