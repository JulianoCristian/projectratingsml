Stage II provides an irrigation and drainage system on 39,250 hectares and on-farm development on these and on an additional 9,000 hectares. Stage III, if found to be economically justified, would complete the plan with the development of the remaining 83,000 hectares. This last stage covers the lowest lying parts of the plain where the technical problems are the most difficult. Work on Stage I is now progressing satisfactorily after some initial difficulties. The irrigation works have been virtually completed for about one year and on-farm development is nearing a satisfactory completion."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"24,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095252","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095252","DocDate":"28-JUN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903111470","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903111470","DocDate":"28-FEB-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67b98_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67b98_1_0","DocDate":"25-FEB-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e89a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e89a_1_0","DocDate":"25-FEB-1969"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
