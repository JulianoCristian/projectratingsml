The project will change mechanisms for provision of technical services to private farmers and initiate important changes in the public institutions providing such services. It will be implemented over three and a half years. Project funds will be used for technical specialists, training, equipment, vehicles, and small support grants. The project will include the following main components: 1) pilot initiatives to develop cost-sharing arrangements with farmer associations, to decentralize extension management and responsibility for support to farmers, and to strengthen Macedonian Extension Service's extension capacity; 2) support for applied agricultural research through competitively-awarded contracts; 3) support for privatization of veterinary services and development of public epidemiological and quarantine services; 4) development of a market news/information service and planning work for a private horticulture wholesale market; 5) assistance to improve farmers' access to commercial credit and to evaluate the feasibility of an apex organization for rural, member-owned Savings Associations; and 6) assistance to selected commercial banks to improve their capacity to facilitate expansion of financial services."},"country_namecode":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of!$!MK","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":31},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":18},"sector4":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":17},"sector5":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"7,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MK","sectorcode":"YA,FZ,AJ,AB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Rural development","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"79,77,75,39","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,10,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":31},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":26},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":18},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":17},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03031904003047","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03031904003047","DocDate":"10-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123400636","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123400636","DocURL":"24-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123400636","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123400636","DocDate":"24-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022105726","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022105726","DocDate":"17-APR-1996"}],"countryname":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
