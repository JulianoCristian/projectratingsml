The program will include three phases. The first phase will focus on the legal framework, the institutions, and the procedures to support improved performance of rural enterprises and stimulate the flow of commercial bank financing to enterprises. The second phase will build on the first phase by expanding the coverage of the advisory services. The third phase will expand the program on a nation-wide basis. There are four components in this project. First, the rural advisory centers component will strengthen information for farm shareholders on shareholder rights, build local business support infrastructure to deliver advice and training on technical and commercial practices, and increase local capacity for the provision of advice. Second, the credit component will finance private farms and associated agri-businesses through participating financial institutions (PFIs). Third, the institutional development component will facilitate secured lending by developing procedures for using moveable property as collateral for bank lending; and creditor-led restructuring through capacity building in the PFI's on procedures for debt work-out, bankruptcy and liquidation. The fourth component will assist in the establishment of a Project Implementation Unit."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kazakhstan!$!KZ","sector1":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":82},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Capital markets"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"KZ","sectorcode":"FK,BC,FZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Rule of law"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"36,78,39,79","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,4,10,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":82},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0302140400270","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0302140400270","DocDate":"31-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200370930","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200370930","DocURL":"23-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200371132","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200371132","DocURL":"23-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980625102039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980625102039","DocDate":"08-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185351","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kazakhstan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
