It will focus on increases in productivity and production of small farmers thus improving their incomes and living standards. The project will consist of a directly productive component including credit for on-farm investment, production inputs, forestry, and other productive activities; an infrastructure component, including upgrading feeder roads, and provision of water supply and waste disposal facilities; and an administrative and technical support component providing technical assistance, extension services and production inputs to participating farmers. The project design is considered to be of low risk because it is based on experiences gained under the Bank's two ongoing rural development projects in Bolivia."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"3,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20090128013116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090128013116","DocDate":"30-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902331765","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902331765","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd072_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd072_1_0","DocDate":"14-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100316010221","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100316010221","DocDate":"24-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
