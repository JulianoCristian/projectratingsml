The objectives of the Integrated Agricultural Export Project include : a) provision of quality food products for export; and b) making agricultural producers more efficient by providing additional financial resources to private, small scale farmers.  The project will provide a line of credit to finance investments by private farmers, agricultural and agroprocessing enterprises to improve their operations.  Investment funds will finance planting material, breeding and fattening stock, equipment for improvement of crop and livestock production, and storage and commodity handling facilities. The project also includes important agricultural policy initiatives which support privitization of farming assets and liberalization of prices and trade."},"country_namecode":"Hungary!$!HU","sector1":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":51},"sector2":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":11},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":32},"sector4":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":4},"sector5":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"HU","sectorcode":"AB,YA,YB,AJ,AH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Rural development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,79,75,45","mjthemecode":"5,10,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":51},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":11},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":32},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":4},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101732","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101732","DocDate":"16-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041915250669","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041915250669","DocDate":"29-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032310090870","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032310090870","DocDate":"29-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928170942","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928170942","DocDate":"22-MAY-1990"}],"countryname":"Hungary"}},"facets":{}}
