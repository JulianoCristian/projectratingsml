It sets out to develop these proven geothermal resources at the Lake Assal location. It also provides the necessary infrastructure for the generation and transmission of the geothermal based electrical power to Djibouti City. The project consists of the following components: (a) scaling studies for the correct design of equipment; (b) a Nomad Settlement Impact Study for potential settlement issues; (c) geothermal drilling in the Lake Assal area; and (d) complementary surface exploration works in the Lake Assal area. It also includes: (e) the installation of power plants, and a well head unit and desalination plant; (f) installation of an electrical transmission line; and (g) technical assistance to Electricite de Djibouti (EdD)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Djibouti!$!DJ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"DJ","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120500711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120500711","DocDate":"16-OCT-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120500912","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120500912","DocURL":"16-OCT-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120500711","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120500711","DocURL":"16-OCT-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120500912","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120500912","DocDate":"16-OCT-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e0844a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0844a_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08447_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08447_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927211049","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927211049","DocDate":"08-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927211313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927211313","DocDate":"08-JUN-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Djibouti"}},"facets":{}}
