Moreover, it would assist the Government in maintaining the newly reformed trade regime. To achieve the above objectives, the project would provide: (a) financial and technical assistance to a number of private industrial enterprises being restructured, including financial restructuring, improving marketing strategies, and upgrading product quality and production facilities; (b) credit assistance to export-oriented or efficient import-substitution industrial enterprises that need financing but no restructuring; and (c) technical assistance to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Fonds de Developpement Industriel (FDI), Financial Intermediaries (FIs) and the Central Bank, strengthen customs administration and support ongoing Government efforts to improve the industrial regulatory framework."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Haiti!$!HT","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":88},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"sector3":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"11,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"HT","sectorcode":"FA,BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,40,45","mjthemecode":"5,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":88},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0012010530353","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0012010530353","DocDate":"31-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042310341917","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042310341917","DocDate":"03-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042310324516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042310324516","DocDate":"10-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042310305215","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042310305215","DocDate":"26-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022611191118","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022611191118","DocDate":"02-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042111461719","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042111461719","DocDate":"02-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e08061_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08061_1_0","DocDate":"05-DEC-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0805f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0805f_1_0","DocDate":"05-DEC-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928110821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928110821","DocDate":"02-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928111010","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928111010","DocDate":"02-NOV-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Haiti"}},"facets":{}}
