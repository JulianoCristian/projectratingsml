The global downturn hit Mongolia hard. This downturn was most immediately felt through the collapse of mineral prices, in particular that of copper. Given Mongolia's high reliance on copper revenues in the budget (with mineral revenues accounting for more than one-third of the total budget revenues), the fiscal shock was very large, causing the overall government balance to shift from a 2.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) surplus in 2007 to a 5.4 percent deficit in 2009. Improving the policy environment is now the overriding priority for the government. Multilateral and bilateral donor activities in the form of budget financing, technical assistance and analytical work provide an important support for the government's policy agenda. Considerable fiscal adjustment remains necessary over the next couple of years. Donor budget financing can play a crucial role in facilitating the process of fiscal adjustment, helping to protect key expenditures such as social protection and investment programs or to limit the recourse to alternative, potentially destabilizing, and financing options."},"country_namecode":"Mongolia!$!MN","sector1":{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":12},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"29,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MN","sectorcode":"TI,BC,FA,JB,LS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,82,54,27,43","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,6,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","code":"LS"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways","code":"TI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":34},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":22},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120504010330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120504010330","DocDate":"31-MAR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20101005234917","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20101005234917","DocDate":"29-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100324150652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100324150652","DocDate":"17-FEB-2010"}],"countryname":"Mongolia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
