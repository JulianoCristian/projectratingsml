There are two components. The institutional restructuring/ reengineering component 1) \"rightsizes\" MASL by offering a voluntary early separation package (VESP) and retraining and redeploying MASL staff; 2) promotes farmer sustainability; 3) commercializes/privatizes business units; 4) hands over infrastructure to national and local agencies; and 5) strengthens natural resource management. The irrigation rehabilitation and improvement component repairs and rehabilitates irrigation systems where needed, and makes essential repairs to reservoirs, main canals, branch canals, distributory canals, field canals, drains, and irrigation tanks.
