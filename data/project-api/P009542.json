The project's main objectives are to substitute power at least cost for imported petroleum products and to strengthen REB and PBSs' performance by : a) expanding distribution networks to unserved areas; b) rehabilitating exisitng systems; c) reducing system losses; and d) improving PBSs' financial viability and institutional performance through modification of accounting practices etc.  By completion, the project will extend public electricity supply to about 122,000 domestic, 20,000 commercial, and 2,900 industrial consumers, as well as to 5,600 irrigation pumps. The project's eight components are the following : 1) construction of 6,035 km primary lines ( 3 phase and single phase ), and 3,015 km of secondary lines; 2) construction of 18 substations; 3) service materials ( service connections, meters, LT capacitors ) for consumer connections; 4) support commodities ( vehicles, motorcycles, tools, boats etc ); 5) rehabilitation of 850 km of existing low voltage lines and distribution substations; 6) general plant for PBSs ( local transport, office and residential buildings etc ); 7) infrastructure and support facilities for REB ( headquarter offices, training center etc ); and finally 8) consulting services to assist REB and the PBSs in project execution and management."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":83},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"105,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,74","mjthemecode":"9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":83},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00081005310465","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081005310465","DocDate":"27-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123264583","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123264583","DocURL":"18-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123264784","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123264784","DocDate":"18-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123264482","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123264482","DocDate":"18-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123264080","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123264080","DocURL":"18-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123264281","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123264281","DocURL":"18-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123264482","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123264482","DocURL":"18-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123264784","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123264784","DocURL":"18-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123264583","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123264583","DocDate":"18-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123264080","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123264080","DocDate":"18-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123264281","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123264281","DocDate":"18-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e08522_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08522_1_0","DocDate":"01-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08520_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08520_1_0","DocDate":"01-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929030425","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929030425","DocDate":"09-APR-1990"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
