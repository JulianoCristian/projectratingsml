The project will achieve three strategic goals: a) improving access to, and equity of basic and primary education; b) enhancing educational quality and relevance; and, c) improving efficiency, and institutional capacity of education service delivery. This additional grant will help fill the financing gap - estimated at US$87l million for the remaining two years - resulting from a cost overrun of core project activities and scaling up of reforms for improved quality and efficiency. The financial gap estimated at US$25 million at the beginning has increased very significantly due to: (a) government's commitment to provide free primary education and meet the popular aspirations of universal primary education, which entailed funding additional teachers and non-salary costs including additional classrooms; (b) unforeseen rise of 27 percent in teacher salaries; (c) increase in number and amount of scholarship for girls and dalits; and (d) a fall of US$ against Nepali Rupee by about 11 percent."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"Primary
