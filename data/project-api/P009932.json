The project has three components. The service delivery component will finance construction, furnishing and equipping of village nutrition centers; increased training for health and nutrition field workers and staff; supervisory vehicles; incremental maternal and child health drugs and medications; therapeutic nutrition supplements for malnourished younger children and at-risk pregnant and nursing women and incremental salary and other operating costs. The communications and community participation component will finance production and distribution of print and audio-visual materials for worker and community use. It would also fund training for community support groups. The project management and evaluation component will finance baseline nutrition surveys of project areas, mid-term and final project impact and process evaluations; vehicles, equipment, training and incremental operating costs of the project monitoring and evaluation system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"95,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,69,68,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123272612","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123272612","DocURL":"14-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123272612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123272612","DocDate":"14-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123272713","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123272713","DocDate":"14-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123272713","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123272713","DocURL":"14-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e085a3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e085a3_1_0","DocDate":"14-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929022918","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929022918","DocDate":"23-MAY-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
