Project benefits are of two orders: first, the building of stronger, better coordinated agricultural institutions which will operate at lower costs than the sum total of the fragmented, sometimes overlapping donor-funded interventions that prevailed so far; second, improvements in the livelihood of rural people, made possible by project actions designed to increase agricultural productivity and create artisanal employment.  Since women provide the majority of labor for crop maintenance and processing, the successful extension of labor saving technologies will be of particular benefit to them by reducing their workload.  Through the community participation approach, villages will become increasingly more efficient at managing their own affairs.  The educated rural youths are expected to gain responsibility and social status as a result.  Other equally significant benefits are expected to arise from the emergence of numerous, varied trading and artisanal activities which will stimulate exchanges and monetize the economy in the project area."},"country_namecode":"Central African Republic!$!CF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"25,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CF","sectorcode":"AB,TA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,79,25,57","mjthemecode":"7,2,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":57},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":26},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121095094","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121095094","DocURL":"01-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121095094","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121095094","DocDate":"01-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e39509_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e39509_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002110705","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002110705","DocDate":"28-APR-1992"}],"countryname":"Central African Republic"}},"facets":{}}
