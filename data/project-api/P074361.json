To that end, the project will place an explicit emphasis on strengthening the interaction between local government level and citizens in improving the quality of life in communities. It will undertake capacity building and asset management at the local government level. At the community level, it will develop community mobilization and advocacy skills to strengthen self-reliance and self-help mechanisms. There are three components: 1) capacity building at local community and self-government levels, through training in management and administrative skills; 2) identification, development and implementation of community based micro-projects; and 3) project management costs. While the project will be nationwide in scope, the primary target group will be the poor communities in peri-urban areas, rural towns and villages."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GE","sectorcode":"JA,EZ,WZ,LZ,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"26,78,57,54,51","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,6,7,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080805005214","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080805005214","DocDate":"27-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03050804034717","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03050804034717","DocDate":"10-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03021104025247","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03021104025247","DocDate":"26-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03051504155175","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03051504155175","DocDate":"28-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02020104040077","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02020104040077","DocDate":"25-JAN-2002"}],"countryname":"Georgia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
