The main problem concerning the railways is that throughout most of the period since 1941 the Government of Spain has not provided sufficient funds to modernize the railway system or even to replace obsolete equipment. As a result, the railway system was never properly integrated. The Railway project will correct this problem. The components entail: 1) reorganizing and strengthening management and supervision; 2) modernizing train and yard operations and maintenance procedures; 3) closing down uneconomic lines and stations; 4) adjusting rates and fares; 5) reducing staff; and 6) improving transport coordination. These measures will modernize the Spanish railways in order to handle new traffic demands, increase efficiency, and improve the quality of service."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Spain!$!ES","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"65,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"ES","sectorcode":"TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901182016","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901182016","DocDate":"15-JAN-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902453355","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902453355","DocDate":"31-JUL-1964"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903474916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903474916","DocDate":"31-JUL-1964"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67847_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67847_1_0","DocDate":"30-JUL-1964"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67846_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67846_1_0","DocDate":"30-JUL-1964"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Spain"}},"facets":{}}
