Besides supporting MIDB in promoting and financing medium and larger industries in the private sector in Egypt, which has received renewed Government support recently, it will support in particular industries in three sectors which have been identified as priorities for growth in the Egyptian economy: a minimum of 25 percent of loan proceeds would be allocated each for building materials and construction/contracting industries; capital goods industries; and export oriented industries. During the commitment period, MIDB's institutional framework would be further strengthened to provide assistance to industrial enterprises in the private sector. The risks are associated with the possible failure of MIDB to fully utilize the funds allocated for capital goods and export oriented projects, although diligent promotion should enable MIDB to meet the target allocation."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e96192_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96192_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96190_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96190_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902351294","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902351294","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912481228","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912481228","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
