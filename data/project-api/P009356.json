The principal works of the project include embankments to empolder the area, regulators with navigation locks, a pumping plant, low-lift pumps and provision for agricultural support and a project consultant. The proposed project would remain fundamentally the same as that financed under Credit No. 184-PAK except for the following changes: (i) relocation of a portion of the project embankment along the Meghna River further inland; (ii) provision of detailed engineering studies for stabilization of the Meghna River bank adjacent to the project; (iii) provision for a comprehensive embankment maintenance program; (iv) preparation and implementation of a plan to mitigate the effect of the project works on fisheries; and (v) unified project management."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"13,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"President's Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"President's Report (PR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PR","EntityID":"000178830_98101902191574","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902191574","DocDate":"30-SEP-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190316544","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190316544","DocDate":"30-APR-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081da570c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da570c_1_0","DocDate":"14-APR-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da570a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da570a_1_0","DocDate":"14-APR-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de3501_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de3501_1_0","DocDate":"14-APR-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810190320018","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190320018","DocDate":"31-MAR-1970"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
