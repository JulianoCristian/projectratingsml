Specifically the project seeks to: a) commence institutional and regulatory reform within the urban water sector with the introduction of commercial principles in the operation and management of water services through the use of a private sector operator; b) accelerate capacity building and human resource development for the sector through training and demonstration effects within the context of the private operator contract; and c) provide an institutional framework that improves the quality and sustainability of user services and acts as an operational model for water services, as these begin to be decentralized to municipal based management. The project consists of three components. 1) Private sector management of water supply systems for five cities will support the lease contracts and management contracts for water supply systems of Maputo, Beira, Quelimane, Nampula, and Pemba. 2) Water supply works will support water supply works, design, and supervision. 3) Urban water supply policy and strategy will finance consulting services, technical assistance, and purchase of equipment for Council for the Regulation of Water Supply."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":62},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"75,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"BC,BH,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"73,40","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":62},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":34},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20091021003841","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20091021003841","DocDate":"30-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2006052514420417","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006052514420417","DocURL":"15-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000014464_2006052514420417","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006052514420417","DocDate":"15-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201072953","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201072953","DocURL":"06-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201073054","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201073054","DocURL":"06-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99060706045384","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99060706045384","DocDate":"12-MAY-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
