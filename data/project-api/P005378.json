This report comprises two impact evaluation reports for Mexico an Morocco, and an overview which synthesizes the findings of both impact evaluations regarding the extent of, and reasons for, sustainability a compares the impact of irrigation systems design on project performance striking feature of all four projects is the lower agricultural and performance than that estimated at the time of audit. Weaker commodity an inadequate development approach in one project, lower than expected efficiencies, insufficient attention to operation and maintenance in a projects, and damage to the environment and natural resources have been main factors affecting performance. However, with one exception, which performed poorly, the degree of success in the transfer of technology respect of both irrigation practice and agricultural productivity has continued to be sustained in the other three projects."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"41,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000334955_20090202071757","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090202071757","DocDate":"29-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84ab8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84ab8_1_0","DocDate":"03-MAY-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902274524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902274524","DocDate":"30-APR-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333037_20100212013235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100212013235","DocDate":"12-APR-1977"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
