This one-tranche operation is the second of a planned series of three PRSCs, and will aim at strengthening the three crosscutting, and institutional issues that were emphasized in the first operation: fiduciary reforms of the State; decentralization process; and, health services, with a focus on improving information, financial and human resources management in the sector, as well as enhancing the access to improved quality basic health services, identified as important factors for determining the performance of this sector. Concurrently, in view of the progress achieved under PRSC-I, this project shall also expand its coverage to two additional areas, perceived as crucial for PRS implementation: a) promoting wealth creation, by supporting ongoing reforms in the labor market, and of improvements in the judiciary system; and, b) improving the living conditions of the most vulnerable groups. While there are several risks associated with this operation, the determination shown by the Government in overcoming resistances, and its efforts to build broad consensus for reforms through consultative processes, (despite a sometimes slow pace of reforms), the benefits of this operation however, clearly outweighs its risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>S\u00e9n\u00e9gal-PRSC 2</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le deuxi\u00e8me Cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 contribuera \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de la strat\u00e9gie de r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, en r\u00e9duisant le d\u00e9ficit entre le co\u00fbt de mise en \u0153uvre de ses principaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments, et les ressources provenant des recettes nationales de l\u2019administration s\u00e9n\u00e9galaise, outre l\u2019aide apport\u00e9e par les donateurs.
