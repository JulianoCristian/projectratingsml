The project also proposes policy and institutional reforms which minimize allocative distortions. The project consists of investments and institutional support for two water pollution control components covering water basins in two of the most congested and polluted metropolitan areas in Brazil: (a) Guarapiranga in Sao Paulo; and (b) Upper Iguacu basin in Curitiba. The subcomponents will include: (a) institutional building and strengthening, including monitoring and evaluation systems; (b) policy and regulation design; (c) studies; (d) river regularization, flood control, and drainage works; (e) rehabilitation of basic sanitation infrastructure for low income population; (f) solid waste collection and disposal; and (g) the provision of sewerage, sewage treatment, drainage, and solid waste disposal in the river basin. The national component is designed to provide finance for project preparation and technical assistance to states and local institutions. Major water pollution sources in the Guarapiranga and Curitiba areas have been identified as primarily domestic, and the two components have been designed accordingly.
