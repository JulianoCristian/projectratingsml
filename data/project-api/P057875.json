The main components provide for: 1) Capacity building, which will restructure and strengthen the Ministry of Mines and Industry (MMI) towards mining law enforcement. This includes organization and staffing of key administrative units with new procedures, staff training, supply of equipment, and rehabilitation of facilities. Additionally, proper computer based cadastre and mine reporting systems will be established, together with explicit criteria and non-discretionary procedures for granting/foreclosing of mining rights; 2) Geologic infrastructure, which includes the preparation of digital geological maps, and, development of a data base for compilation/update of geological information. Supporting the geological mapping, a geophysic airborne survey will be implemented. Supervision will follow the integration of this component, with a final processing and printing of the digital mapping; 3) Environmental management system, to include capacity building at MMI, for monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations. Studies will assess and monitor social, cultural, and economic impacts on local communities."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania!$!MR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MR","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"30","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"2,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050623100004","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050623100004","DocDate":"15-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031214450759","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031214450759","DocDate":"21-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99051205330936","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99051205330936","DocDate":"20-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911070579","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911070579","DocDate":"17-DEC-1998"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
