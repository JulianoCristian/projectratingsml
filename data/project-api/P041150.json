The project has the following components: (1) Rural Water Infrastructure - comprising integrated development and water resources management, including catchment management and other water conservation practices; investments for the rational use of water for agriculture, livestock and human consumption including small dams, dugouts, boreholes, hand-dug wells, streamflow diversion and pumping to support small-scale irrigation in the dry season; and rainfall conservation and management for more effective use in rainfed crop production. (2) Rural Transport Infrastructure - selectively rehabilitating and improving degraded feeder roads; developing village trails and tracks linking farms to villages to permit the use of simple wheeled vehicles to reduce the need for women and children to head carry weights; and a pilot program to develop intermediate means for the rural poor to convey goods to market. (3) Rural Post-Harvest Infrastructure - developing on-farm and village-level drying facilities to reduce post-harvest losses; on-farm and community storage and other village-level market infrastructure for more efficient marketing; appropriate facilities for processing crops, livestock and fisheries products to increase their quality shelflife and market value; and income-generating activities targeted at the poorest. (4) Institutional Strengthening - capacity building within district assemblies to strengthen their planning and financial management of rural infrastructure; strengthening NGOs and other community-based organizations to provide more effective implementation support to communities and groups in developing sustainable rural infrastructure; and empowering beneficiary associations and groups to take direct responsibility for the sus"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"JB,WZ,AZ,TZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,26,78,56","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,10,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":22},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":13},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20060808123448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060808123448","DocDate":"07-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050218132224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050218132224","DocDate":"29-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200480795","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200480795","DocURL":"16-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172225","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101614","DocDate":"28-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110135","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110135","DocDate":"30-NOV-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
