The State of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) is the third largest in Brazil. The Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro (RMRJ), with a population of 12 million, is the nation's second largest metropolitan area. As the historical capital and a major tourism destination, the RMRJ has special significance for Brazil. The region's economy and urban growth have suffered considerably since the 1970s as a result of the relocation of the capital to Brasilia, as well as industrial restructuring, and social problems. Rio's share of the country's population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined between 1970 and 2001. However, growth has recovered significantly in recent years, and the RMRJ has entered into a new era of development, supported by new industrial poles and the opportunities provided by being the host city of mega-events such as the 2016 Summer Olympic Games and the 2014 World Cup."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government
