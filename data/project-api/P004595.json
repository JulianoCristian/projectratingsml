This project consists of four components.  First, subloans for local government units (LGUs) subprojects will support investments in upland agriculture, community forestry, coastal resources and nearshore fisheries, and small scale rural infrastructure.  Second, Municipal Development Fund (MDF) rural window initiative and project management will support the overall project management and the appraisal of subprojects.  Third, planning and implementation support for LGUs will provide training in preparing development plans, and will manage procurement and financial matters.  Fourth, environmental technology transfer and policy management will a) support DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources) in site verification, training, and conducting studies on tenurial instruments; b) will support the production and packaging of technology, verification of technology, and preparation of environment reports; and c) will finance the technical services for coastal and aquatic resources."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":8},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"JB,BH,TA,WC,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,83,26,82","mjthemecode":"11,2,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":45},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080813003231","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080813003231","DocDate":"15-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110436","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110436","DocDate":"26-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101013","DocDate":"28-JAN-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
