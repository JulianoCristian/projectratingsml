The extension is necessary to complete financing of the grants which were already approved and still disbursing from loan funds and to complete design of a new building for laboratory in part A.2 of the project description. In first three rounds, 356 subprojects have been approved and started implementation; while in the fourth round an additional 221 sub-projects have been approved and will start disbursing after extension of the closing date. In addition, the contract for designing the National Reference Laboratory is in the final phase of negotiation. Although the request is to extend the project until June 30, 2013 the team feels that at the moment extending until June 30, 2012 is fully sufficient to complete design/construction of the laboratory, conduct a tender to select contractor for construction of the laboratory and financing of the grant subprojects. The Ministry of Agriculture remains committed to complete construction in spite of the delays and procurement difficulties, and have expressed interest in initiating a dialogue with the Bank on a possible follow-up operation. This will be the first extension of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kazakhstan!$!KZ","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and
