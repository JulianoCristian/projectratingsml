There are two components to the project. The first component is the technical assistance component. To strengthen the technical and institutional capacity related to SO2 emission control and reduction in Shandong, it includes: (i) capacity building and enhancement in emission monitoring and regulation enforcement, including upgrading of online monitoring equipment and information systems; and (ii) technical and managerial training; and (iii) development of related regulations, procedures, and policies. Finally, the second component is the investment component to finance the installation of Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) facilities at four coals fired heat and power plants. These plants include existing coal-fired cogeneration units and cogeneration units that are under construction or planned for construction. All plants have selected to install limestone-gypsum wet FGD technology."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
