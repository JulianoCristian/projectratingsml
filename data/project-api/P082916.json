This will allow for the completion of the Financial Management Information System (FMIS) and achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO). The new budget classification, chart of accounts, internal audit practices supported by the project can only be fully implemented with the FMIS in place. The implementation of the FMIS will benefit the public financial management (PFM) system of the country and has major implications on the budget support provided by the World Bank, the European Union (EU) and other donors. The high-level commitment of the management of the MoF, as evidenced by appointment of the Deputy Minister as Project Manager in 2012 and improved project management practices, provides a basis for the successful completion of the FMIS in 2013. Given that all the efforts will be directed towards the implementation of the FMIS and that non-FMIS related objectives were achieved, the portion of the IDA credit not related to FMIS development will be cancelled as part of this restructuring."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national
