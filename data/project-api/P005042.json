It will substitute for annual imports of around 750,000 tons of product, thus saving valuable foreign exchange. By means of the project, new technology and associated managerial/operational know-how will be introduced into the sector, and through a sector program the Government will formulate and execute necessary policies to promote the continued efficient development of the steel industry in Egypt. The project comprises the construction and operation of an integrated reinforcing bar plant and includes: (i) a natural gas-based direct reduction plant; (ii) a steelmaking plant consisting of four electric arc furnaces and three continuous billet casters; (iii) a rolling mill plant comprising two rolling mills and a common roll shop; and (iv) auxiliary and administrative facilities, residential units and social infrastructure."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"165,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000009265_3961214133117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214133117","DocDate":"23-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925030056","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925030056","DocDate":"23-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925151642","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925151642","DocDate":"29-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902415516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902415516","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901002424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901002424","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
