The project will contain the following broad categories of components: a) rehabiliation of idle wells and facilities where warranted; b) systematic reconstruction of existing field infrastructure for a limited number of fields; c) in-fill drilling in existing fields; d) technical assistance for project implementation and for preparation of field optimization plans and e) equipment and services to help mitigate the effects of oil operations on the environment."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and
