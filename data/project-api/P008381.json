These objectives will be accomplished in the context of overall reform of the energy sector. To this end, the project will: (a) reduce total consumption of pollution-causing lignite through power plant efficiency improvements; (b) curtail power plant sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by means of flue gas desulfurization; (c) reduce dust and fly-ash pollution from power plants; (d) increase the reliability, efficiency and economy of the CEZ transmission system; and (e) assist in improving investment planning and corporate management and organization. The project includes: (a) installation of equipment and operational improvements at the Prunerov II power station and other large CEZ power plants to reduce lignite consumption; (b) installation of flue gas desulfurization equipment at Prunerov II; (c) improvements and equipment for dust collection,; (d) modernization of five 400-kV substations and construction of a short 400-kV transmission line; and (e) consulting services and staff training."},"country_namecode":"Czech Republic!$!CZ","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"246,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CZ","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,39,74,81,84","mjthemecode":"11,11,9,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00032505302186","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00032505302186","DocDate":"25-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200084986","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200084986","DocURL":"17-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200084986","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200084986","DocDate":"17-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200084885","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200084885","DocURL":"17-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200084885","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200084885","DocDate":"17-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002021914","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002021914","DocDate":"21-FEB-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002021733","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002021733","DocDate":"21-FEB-1992"}],"countryname":"Czech Republic"}},"facets":{}}
