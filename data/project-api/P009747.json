The program aims at large-scale tree plantation along roads, rails and canals, on village common lands unsuitable for cropping, and on degraded forest reserves in need of rehabilitation. The trees would provide a much-needed source of energy to the villages, raw materials to cottage industries, and greater stability to the environment. The ultimate objective would be to have the villagers establish as soon as possible their own village forests, using voluntary labor, with the assistance of state-wide forest extension services, for distribution of fuelwood and other products to village communities. About 48,600 ha of public and village lands would be planted under the project, 45,600 ha of which would be carried out by the Uttar Pradesh Social Forestry Directorate with varying degrees of community participation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"23,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924172938","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924172938","DocDate":"28-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924172856","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924172856","DocDate":"22-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd1a6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd1a6_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd1a4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd1a4_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902331152","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902331152","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
