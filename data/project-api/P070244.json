There are five project components. The first provides technical assistance for the strengthening of the regulatory and environmental framework by reviewing the Water Act and other key legislation, drafting regulations, outlining the new operating license, and training staff, among other activities. The second component funds technical assistance to strengthen the management information systems, financial management and accounting systems, and customer service and operations for the water and sewerage company (WASCO). The third component conducts and implements a feasibility study for the private sector participation transaction carried out the regulatory work described above. The study covers demand estimates, expansion and rehabilitation investment needs assessment, financial modeling, a private sector participation structure (debt treatment, tariff levels and structure, ownership), and an investor survey. this component also hires investment bankers and legal services. The fourth component finances a meter purchase and installation program, an intake upgrade and new treatment plant, replacement of the raw water supply pipeline, and replacement of sewage pumps.
