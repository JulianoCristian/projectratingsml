It would also substantially reduce flood damage, generate an average of 770 million kilowatt hours annually and provide 460 MW of peaking capacity for Korea's power system. The principal features of the project include: a 90 m high concrete dam across the south Han River; a power plant containing four 115 MW generating units and associated transmission facilities; a reregulating dam about 20 km downstream of the main dam; relocation of about 100 km of roads and 10 km of railway; protective works in the reservoir area including the raising of an existing embankment of a cement plant and other miscellaneous works; implementation of a resettlement program for some 9,300 families affected by the project; and consulting services. A demanding feature of the project in terms of management will be the timely acquisition of land and property in the reservoir area, and the prompt payment of compensation. However, programs of a similar nature in Korea have been undertaken in the past without serious delays or social problems."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"125,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902322657","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902322657","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e437_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e437_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e436_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e436_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912382939","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912382939","DocDate":"28-FEB-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
