The project will support: 1) the Department of Agriculture's work program, including the extension services for horticulture, fisheries, and livestock to poor rural communities aimed at increasing their production; 2) institutional development (technology generation and extension, seed multiplication and land administration, and planning and coordination); and 3) rural infrastructure (small scale irrigation and rural roads). The project will also include a number of studies considered necessary for improving the use of natural resources and the marketing of highly perishable horticultural products."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":39},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":18},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"126,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BH,TA,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"86,59,39,78","mjthemecode":"10,4,7,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":43},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":39},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":18}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050103114152","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050103114152","DocDate":"23-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123362079","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123362079","DocURL":"06-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123362180","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123362180","DocDate":"06-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123361878","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123361878","DocDate":"06-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123361878","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123361878","DocURL":"06-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123362180","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123362180","DocURL":"06-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123362079","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123362079","DocDate":"06-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e23e90_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23e90_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23e8e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23e8e_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029205440","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029205440","DocDate":"26-APR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
