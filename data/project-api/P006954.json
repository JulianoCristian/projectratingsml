These reforms must be continued and consolidated to provide a base for sustained and equitable development. The government aims to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of health services. This project will support the Government's effort to implement critical policy, institutional and operational reforms. It will assist the Costa Rican Social Security System (CCSS) institutional reforms at the central level; support the implementation of a redefined model of primary health care which would reinforce national priority health care programs, while being responsive to regional and local programs, and address operational and management issues such as clinic protocols, referral systems, staffing patterns, and monitoring and evaluation; strengthen the CCSS financial complex; and prepare for the establishment of a National Surveillance and Quality Control Laboratory. The project will also explore alternatives and establish parameters for further refinement in the sector. It will lay fiscal and strucutral frameworks for complete reform of the entire health sector. These measures will have far reaching medium and long term impacts on the social security and health care provision systems in the country. It represents the first step in the restructuring of the CCSS to improve efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the social security system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Costa Rica!$!CR","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"22,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"CR","sectorcode":"BC,BK,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"26,67,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20030618174647","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20030618174647","DocDate":"14-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123000094","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123000094","DocURL":"06-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123000295","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123000295","DocURL":"06-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122595893","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122595893","DocDate":"06-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052111084992","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052111084992","DocDate":"06-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123000295","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123000295","DocDate":"06-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122595893","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122595893","DocURL":"06-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123000094","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123000094","DocDate":"06-DEC-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Costa Rica","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
