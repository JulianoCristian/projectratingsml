The project consists of three project components. First, the emergency investment measures component involves the construction of critically needed high voltage evacuation lines and transmission lines and substations, and the rehabilitation of sub-transmission and distribution systems. The second component is the improvement of commercial and technical services to the consumers. This will introduce decentralized computerized billing systems at all sub-divisional offices, and improve and upgrade the complaint centers at all district and operation division headquarters. Third, the technical assistance and engineering services component will reform program management and communication, establish and carry out institutional development of the Regulatory Commission, privatize one distribution company, and implement engineering services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
