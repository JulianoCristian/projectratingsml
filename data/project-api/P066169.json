The main components are: 1) provision of market-driven financing for selected micro-finance institutions (MFIs), to increase their outreach, and quality of services to low-income clients. MFIs will assess eligibility criteria, and technical services needs, while a long-term financing strategy in Euro-denominated loans with a fifteen year term, to MFIs will build a capital base, and assist them with leverage commercial financing; 2) development of micro-finance legal, and regulatory frameworks, to enable the current Micro Credit Organizations -later on MFIs - expand their sources of capital, and services. Alternative institutional forms will be developed within a financial sector framework, so as to mobilize sustainable sources of financing, such as commercial bank financing, equity investment, and savings, i.e., financial companies, for profit, credit-only institutions, and, membership-based savings, and credit institutions, which would only accept deposits from their members. Legal advisory, and consulting services, and technical assistance will be financed; 3) strengthening the institutional, and financial capacity, and performance of MFIs, through training, and technical consulting services; 4) financing of a longitudinal impact assessment, to build MFIs program management, and local research capacity, supported by advisory services; and, 5) project management, and operating costs, funded as government counterpart contributions to the project."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"BA","sectorcode":"BG,BC,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Rule of law"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"34,51,41","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,6,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060117113856","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060117113856","DocDate":"21-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201230903","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201230903","DocURL":"19-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201231205","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201231205","DocURL":"19-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201230702","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201230702","DocURL":"19-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201231004","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201231004","DocURL":"19-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00121302000853","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121302000853","DocDate":"04-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060804044289","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060804044289","DocDate":"31-MAY-2001"}],"countryname":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
