The five research agencies would be consolidated, and planning, management, financial control and monitoring activities improved. Concurrently a Master Plan would be drawn up identifying priorities for a sustainable research program.  Cotton, root and tuber and farming systems research would be improved in the early stages, while a research fund would finance other priority programs identified by the Master Plan.  There would also be funds for early purchase of urgently needed vehicules, equipment and materials, to sustain the ongoing research program.  Civil works, technical assistance, training, and foreign recurrent costs would also be financed.  The participation of the Special Program for African Agricultural Research (SPAAR) should ensure close donor coordination by agreement to tie the research program to the Master Plan."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"8,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development"],"themecode":"78","mjthemecode":"10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99061606182024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99061606182024","DocDate":"24-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042916071371","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042916071371","DocDate":"21-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031011004572","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031011004572","DocDate":"03-FEB-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08399_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08399_1_0","DocDate":"13-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926112806","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926112806","DocDate":"21-NOV-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926112614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926112614","DocDate":"25-JUL-1988"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
