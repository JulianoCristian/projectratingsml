The secondary development objective is to modify the National Environment Sanitation Service's (SENASA) role in the sector from an implementer of projects to an efficiently managed promoter of activities.  The first of four components consists of three subcomponents: 1) New water systems built, basically consisting of a deep well, an elevated tank and a distribution network of primary and/or secondary networks. 2) The production, storage, and distribution systems of ten existing systems will be expanded. 3) New   systems in the department of Chaco will be constructed to supply water to indigenous systems.  The second component consists of two subcomponents: sewage systems -where the communities have grown and there are serious environmental problems from the lack of sanitation- and the construction and distribution of concrete slabs for latrines will be financed. The third component includes the following subcomponents: institutional strengthening of SENASA and newly formed Juntas by financing professional, technical, and community training, and strengthening the environmental management capability of SENASA; designing a pilot program and building incentives for private providers (Aguaterias); promotion of associations of Juntas; and planing a National Rural Water and Sanitation Program. Project component four consists of engineering design for all of the systems; community mobilization and promotion; supervision of the various civil works; and administration and monitoring by SENASA and staff; and analyzing the project's environmental impact."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Paraguay!$!PY","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"PY","sectorcode":"BH,BC,WS,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,77,26,57","mjthemecode":"7,2,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":68},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20110706014109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110706014109","DocDate":"28-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080402011326","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080402011326","DocDate":"21-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200333175","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200333175","DocURL":"27-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200332974","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200332974","DocURL":"27-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200332974","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200332974","DocDate":"27-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200332873","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200332873","DocDate":"27-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200333175","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200333175","DocDate":"27-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185010","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185010","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3971104184512","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971104184512","DocDate":"06-AUG-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Paraguay"}},"facets":{}}
