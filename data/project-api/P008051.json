The project will promote water conservation, support the Lima Water and Sewerage Service Company's (SEDAPAL's) privatization, rehabilitate damaged water supply and sewerage systems, expand services to the urban poor in the pueblos jovenes, and support reforms in the legal and institutional framework of the water and sanitation sector. The project has four components. The water conservation component includes preparing a customer cadastre, reconstructing water meter boxes, and installing 406,000 water meters. This component will also initiate conjunctive use of surface and groundwater in three districts where groundwater is depleted and the risk of saline contamination is serious. The rehabilitation component will improve water supply and sewerage in the twelve districts that comprise 40 percent of SEDAPAL's water sales and 75 percent of total revenue. Wells will also be rehabilitated under this component. The pueblos jovenes component will expand and improve water and sanitation services for 600,000 of Lima's poor. The institutional strengthening component involves studies and technical assistance programs for SEDAPAL and the Superintendency of Sanitary Services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
