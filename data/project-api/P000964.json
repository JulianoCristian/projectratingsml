In order to accomplish this, the project will have the specific objective of improving the amount and quality of teaching and learning time in primary schools, particularly, as far as 1,983 of the least well endowed primary schools are concerned.  The project, which concentrates on those schools, combines the implementation of key policy and management changes with investments in physical infrastructure.  In key policy and management changes, the inputs will be:  (a) increasing official teaching hours from 4 hours a day to at least 5 a day; (b) ensuring that District Education Officers do not arrange any functions or activities for schoolteachers during official teaching hours; (c) eliminating all fees and levies that are not officially endorsed by the Ministry of Education and that are currently imposed on primary school students; (d) involving communities in the selection of headteachers; (e) training and re-training of circuit monitoring assistants; and (f) strengthening the Ministry of Education's implementation, monitoring and planning capacity. In investments in physical infrastructure, the inputs will be:  (a) constructing 10,977 classrooms; (b) constructing 1,983 headteachers houses; (c) re-roofing of 1,546 classrooms; (d) employing construction supervision and technical auditing consultants; and (e) mobilizing communities to clear and prepare the sites and rapidly clad the pavilions and make cement wall blackboards."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":2},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"65,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"BC,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Human development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,65,71,57","mjthemecode":"7,9,8,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":97},{"Name":"Education","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20040803103035","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040803103035","DocDate":"01-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121172368","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121172368","DocDate":"26-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121172368","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121172368","DocURL":"26-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e125ce_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e125ce_1_0","DocDate":"10-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004104938","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004104938","DocDate":"17-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004104446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004104446","DocDate":"17-MAY-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
