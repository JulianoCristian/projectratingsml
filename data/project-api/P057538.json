Project components include: 1) road reconstruction, rehabilitation, and improvement, covering sections of the main Central America corridor, roads connecting neighboring countries, and roads located in the southwestern region of the country, known as the \"natural corridor\". In addition, the Santa Rita-Yoro road, the most severely damaged road by Hurricane Mitch, will be reconstructed, to include replacement of four bridges, retaining walls, and river channels. Improvements include sections connecting the central part of the country, and the most southern section, referred to as the Central Highway; 2) rural roads and bridges, involving rehabilitation of high priority rural roads, complementing USAID financing in several Departments of the country. Environmental mitigation will address part of the works; 3) a pilot project on road maintenance, partly financed by participating local communities through the formation of micro-enterprises, established with consultants' assistance; 4) consultant services, and technical assistance to supervise works, and strengthen the Planning Directorate, and the Road Fund organization; and, 5) a limited amount of goods, such as equipment, vehicles, and computers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de Reconstrucci\u00f3n y Mejoramiento de Caminos</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"66,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Resettlement Plan,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"52,78","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080321030121","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080321030121","DocDate":"18-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052509341746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052509341746","DocDate":"09-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201165752","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201165752","DocDate":"09-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201165752","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201165752","DocURL":"09-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.5","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00112305422232","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112305422232","DocDate":"27-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00102405533980","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00102405533980","DocDate":"13-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_00112805302549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112805302549","DocDate":"03-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00112305422128","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112305422128","DocDate":"30-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.4","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00112305422131","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112305422131","DocDate":"30-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00112305422130","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112305422130","DocDate":"30-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99102805360025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99102805360025","DocDate":"30-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00112305422129","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112305422129","DocDate":"31-JAN-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
