The project has two components : 1) the Infrastructure Rehabilitation component includes the following investments: Zagreb network rehabilitation entails the replacement of a dual pipe trench (35 km), transmission pipes (20 km), and distribution pipes (15 km). These investments were identified as priority rehabilitation investments where energy and water losses are high; and, Osijek network rehabilitation entails the replacement of distribution pipes (1 5 km) and connection to the main combined heat power (CHP) plant of customers currently connected to the inefficient local heat only boilers. 2) the consulting services component includes: the development of a demand side management (DSM) Program, where HEPT will look at options to promote voluntary installation of DSM equipment. The component further includes the completion of two surveys in Zagreb and Osijek; preparation of bidding documents; construction supervision; and, preparation of annual
