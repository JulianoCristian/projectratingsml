The main objective of the ESMP is to reinforce the international competitiveness of Mauritius' labor force, and transform the country into a technologically more sophisticated economy.  The ESMP plans to increase access to and improve the quality of secondary education, with the specific target of increasing secondary enrollments by 15,000 students.  Other objectives include improving the quality and efficiency of education at all levels, expanding tertiary education, and strengthening education sector planning and management.  To achieve these objectives, the project supports ESMP policy measures.  The project finances the following investments designed to:  (1) increase access to and promote equity of education by:  (a) providing for the rehabilitation of 25 dilapidated primary schools and construction of 13 new primary schools in underserved regions; (b) renovating 21 state secondary schools and constructing 5 new secondary schools; (c) providing financial support to upgrade schools and enrollment capacity; and (d) expanding enrollment capacity at the University of Mauritius; (2) improve the quality of education by:  (a) funding the design and implementation of a renewed national system to assess student achievement; (b) supporting pre-service and in-service teacher training; and (c) providing library materials and teaching aids; and (3) strengthen education sector management by:  (a) assisting the tertiary education commission to prepare institutional development plans for higher education institutions; (b) establishing an education management information system; (c) supporting research to explore alternative approaches for more effective, efficient and flexible delivery of education; "},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mauritius!$!MU","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":56},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":19},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MU","sectorcode":"BC,EP,ET,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"66,61,65","mjthemecode":"8,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":56},{"Name":"Education","Percent":23},{"Name":"Education","Percent":19},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99062405302961","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99062405302961","DocDate":"10-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121400006","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121400006","DocURL":"16-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121400207","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121400207","DocURL":"16-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003142915","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003142915","DocDate":"01-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003142609","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003142609","DocDate":"01-MAR-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mauritius"}},"facets":{}}
