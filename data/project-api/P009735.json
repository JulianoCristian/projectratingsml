The main project benefit will be an increase in production benefitting an estimated 7.6 million farm families. Small farmers with limited financial resources but excess labor will be the primary beneficiaries of the project's emphasis on efficientuse of existing resources. The most significant risk lies in the fact that the effectiveness of the new extension methodology is highly dependent on an efficient organization and management of extension and research services, as well as on farmers' response. Experience with ongoing projects has already demonstrated, however, that the new system can work efficiently in formulation and delivery of messages, and in motivating farmers. Project components include the provision of: additional staff, housing, equipment, vehicles and staff training for the extension service; additional staff, vehicles, simple farm buildings and equipment in order to strengthen adaptive research; and staff, equipment, vehicles and funds for project monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902291194","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902291194","DocDate":"31-DEC-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191226509","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191226509","DocDate":"31-DEC-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081df5692_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081df5692_1_0","DocDate":"27-DEC-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b85_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b85_1_0","DocDate":"27-DEC-1977"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
