It seeks to improve agricultural productivity and income, and thereby help alleviate rural poverty.  Furthermore, the proposed project intends to test extension strategies in 20 of Mexico's 192 Rural Development Districts (RDD).  The project areas are representative of two of the country's four major agroecological zones; the irrigated areas of the arid northwest and the temperate central highlands.  The project intends to finance:  (a) training programs for extension personnel, researchers and farmers; (b) construction of limited office facilities at the Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources (SARH) service centers; (c) procurement of vehicles and equipment for extension and research personnel; and (d) recurrent expenditures of the extension service."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006175829","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006175829","DocDate":"15-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042013181012","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042013181012","DocDate":"31-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040812091613","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040812091613","DocDate":"31-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926055349","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926055349","DocDate":"01-JUN-1987"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
