Project objectives are fourfold : 1) improve women's productivity and income earning potential; 2) improve women's welfare and status; 3) strengthen government institutions to enable them to better deal with women's issues; and 4) contribute to bringing about a change in society's perception of their role. The project comprises the following six components : a) increasing women's agricultural productivity, disposable income, and nutritional level through the strengthening of agricultural extension services, and cooperatives; b) improve rural women's skills, through promotion of basic literacy and numeracy skills; c) promoting safe motherhood and strengthening family planning services, and expanding the contraceptive distribution system; d) developing an information, education and communication (IEC) strategy and reinforcing ongoing educational campaigns on agriculture, health, family planning and nutrition; e) strengthening the Women's Bureau for policy and program formulation; and f) establishing a fund to be used by NGOs for small projects and programs to help women and children."},"country_namecode":"Republic of The Gambia!$!GM","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":19},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":43},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"7,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GM","sectorcode":"BC,EV,JA,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"41,57,44,69,25","mjthemecode":"2,8,4,7,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":8},{"Name":"Education","Percent":19},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":43}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980929125118","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929125118","DocDate":"10-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120564471","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120564471","DocDate":"29-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120564471","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120564471","DocURL":"29-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08560_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08560_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e0855f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0855f_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928233207","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928233207","DocDate":"07-MAY-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of The Gambia"}},"facets":{}}
