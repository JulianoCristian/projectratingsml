The Emergency School Readiness Project is the first in a series of steps in that direction, concentrating on East Timor's most urgent short-term educational challenge, revitalizing its basic educational infrastructure with functional schools (primary and secondary), furniture and equipment, books and learning materials, and management support. The project aims at providing school-aged children and youth with education at the \"basic operational level,\" meaning schools with safe and clean buildings having roofs and school furniture, textbooks and learning materials, and management support. There are five project components. While the first project component rebuilds school physical infrastructure, the second provides learning-teaching materials, the third mobilizes and communicates with the community, the fourth conducts school mapping and supports workshops, study tours, and preliminary studies related to policy development, and the fifth component strengthens the project management unit."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!$!TP","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":43},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"13,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TP","sectorcode":"BC,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,65,66,57","mjthemecode":"7,8,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":43},{"Name":"Education","Percent":43},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03042504020533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03042504020533","DocDate":"16-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051315470662","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051315470662","DocDate":"21-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00082605441449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082605441449","DocDate":"21-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00060805365642","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00060805365642","DocDate":"16-JUN-2000"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste"}},"facets":{}}
