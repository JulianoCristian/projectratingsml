Farm investments would include a boundary fence, fencing to divide the land into paddocks, tools, seeds, fifteen heifers, a bull and nine steers. Where possible the farmers would attend a farmer's training course. (ii) Pigs: the project would help about 270 farmers purchase two or three sows and two fattening pigs for each farm. It would also finance the construction of inexpensive pig shelters. Projects would be located in areas where good crops of sweet potatoes can be grown, which the animals would be fed together with protein concentrate. (iii) Poultry: typical project poultry units would consist of 100 layers or the production of 600 broilers per year at the rate of 50 per month. Financing would be provided for sheds, water tanks, cages, equipment and chicks. As some previous poultry investments have been unsuccessful only twenty farmers would be financed initially, and further investments would depend on the satisfactory evaluation of the initial group. (iv) Technical services: the project would finance the construction of a new Livestock Farmers Training Center and an In-Service Training Center for DASF staff."},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine!$!PG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PG","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912592194","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912592194","DocDate":"23-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081de3518_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de3518_1_0","DocDate":"31-OCT-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de3516_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de3516_1_0","DocDate":"31-OCT-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b13_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b13_1_0","DocDate":"31-OCT-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902191981","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902191981","DocDate":"31-OCT-1972"}],"countryname":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine"}},"facets":{}}
