The restructuring would: (a) revise the Project Development Objective (PDO) statement to better reflect the outputs and outcomes that are achievable and attributable to the project; (b) revise the results framework to align indicators with the revised PDO; (c) add a new subcomponent under part B of the project, 'prevention of the spread of HIV/AIDS', for the provision of mini-grants to support the subprojects carried out by youth organizations; (d) amend part C of schedule two to the grant agreement to reduce the work program for the Caribbean Epidemiology Center (CAREC) and add the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) as the implementing entity in charge of some of the activities under this component; (e) allow for the utilization of the 2006 revision of the procurement and consultant guidelines; and (f) amend schedule one to the grant agreement to: (i) include a new category of expenditures for mini-grants; (ii) reallocate resources among categories of expenditure to take account of the actual costs of project activities; (iii) allow the following expenditures to be financed from the proceeds of the grant: 'goods' under part B, 'prevention of the spread of HIV/AIDS' and 'Training' under part A, 'advocacy and policy development' and part B of the project 'prevention of the spread of HIV/AIDS'; and (iv) increase the financing percentage in category five, 'operating expenses' to 100 p"},"country_namecode":"Caribbean!$!6R","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":59},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Paper,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"6R","sectorcode":"BC,JA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Rule of law","Human development"],"themecode":"88,36,93","mjthemecode":"8,3,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":59},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":26},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20090617040649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20090617040649","DocDate":"02-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20080507010258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080507010258","DocDate":"06-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20060710103951","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060710103951","DocDate":"01-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20060710153719","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060710153719","DocDate":"01-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20060710153117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060710153117","DocDate":"01-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20060710151943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060710151943","DocDate":"01-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20060227100310","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060227100310","DocDate":"24-FEB-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051011402171","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051011402171","DocDate":"28-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20040309103136","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040309103136","DocDate":"04-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000012009_20040423141603","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040423141603","DocDate":"17-FEB-2004"}],"countryname":"Caribbean"}},"facets":{}}
