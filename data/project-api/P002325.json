To achieve these objectives, the project involves several components.  They include such items as rehabilitating and construction of classrooms, teacher training, curriculum development, improved resource management, textbook production and the increase and redeployment of primary school teachers into the classrooms.  The operation would improve access to primary education nationwide.  Through the application of adjustment policy measures, enrollments are expected to increase by about 32 percent by the 1994/95 school year without increasing the share of education in the Government budget from its 1985/86 level.  The operation would also improve the quality of primary education through the provision of textbooks, development of revised curricula, and teacher upgrading programs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008043856","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008043856","DocDate":"04-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36ba5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36ba5_1_0","DocDate":"14-OCT-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092802","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092802","DocDate":"30-SEP-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100428051158","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100428051158","DocDate":"09-SEP-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
