The project will not be subject to any extraordinary risk. BIDC's proposed policy for increased rental rates of factory space, to enable it to generate a positive rate of return, may reduce the demand for space in Barbados. This reduction, however, is not expected to be large as the rentals will still be in line with those charged by BIDC's competitors in the Caribbean."},"country_namecode":"Barbados!$!BB","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BB","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924225219","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924225219","DocDate":"25-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902343732","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902343732","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912483271","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912483271","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"}],"countryname":"Barbados"}},"facets":{}}
