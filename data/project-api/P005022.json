Besides enabling DIB to continue to provide foreign exchange resources to industrial projects in the private sector, which has received renewed Government support recently, DIB will increase its financial and technical assistance to small scale industrial enterprises (SSI). Over 1980-81 DIB will alocate 30 percent of its total term-lending to SSI. DIB will also allocate up to $10 million of its total foreign currency resources in those years to assist smaller SSI. Up to 20 percent of the loan proceeds could be made available to public sector enterprises with export potential. During the commitment period of the loan, DIB's institutional framework will be further strengthened to provide assistance to industrial enterpises in the private sector. No special risks are associated with the project."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9610c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9610c_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e9610b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9610b_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902342919","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902342919","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912472753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912472753","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
