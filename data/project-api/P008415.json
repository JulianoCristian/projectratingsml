The specific goals are to develop an agricultural credit system; facilitate increased liquidity in land markets; and identify an agricultural development and investment  program to address major constraints to increasing agricultural productivity.  To support the above objectives, the project will provide financing to the Project Coordinating Unit and to four free-standing components.  Three of these components: a) Credit to Enterprises; b) Credit Unions; and c) Agricultural Services, will have nation-wide coverage.  The Land Registration component will be limited to two administrative districts (rayons) in the vicinity of Tbilisi."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":18},"sector4":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GE","sectorcode":"AZ,FA,YB,BC,YA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"79,41,36,75","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,3,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":18},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060501094920","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060501094920","DocDate":"07-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183531","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183531","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052410361098","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052410361098","DocDate":"14-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123433974","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123433974","DocURL":"14-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123433974","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123433974","DocDate":"14-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170711","DocDate":"28-FEB-1997"}],"countryname":"Georgia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
