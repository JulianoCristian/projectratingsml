The restructuring is intended to: extend the project closing date by 18 months from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2013; and extend the objectives and intermediate indicators' target dates to reflect the longer implementation period. The extension was requested by the Turkish Treasury in a letter dated June 14, 2012. The extension of the project will allow TCDD to complete the main investment component, a signaling system on the Mersin-Toprakkale and Yenice-Bogazkopru lines, and use available technical assistance funds to support the railway sector reform specified and recently circulated law on liberalization of railway transportation in Turkey. Without the extension, TCDD will not be able to complete the implementation of the signaling system using Bank loan funds, which is essential for increased capacity and improved safety."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public
