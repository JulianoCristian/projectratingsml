Because of their potential for earning foreign currency, tourism projects will also be eligible. Beneficiaries will include mostly medium and large enterprises regardless of their form of ownership (this will include state owned, reformed private, private and Social Property Enterprises). However, no more than 30% of the loan ($10.5 million equivalent) could be re-lent to Social Property Enterprises reflecting the lack of experience with this form of self-managed firm. For the same reason subloans to Social Property Enterprises will require Bank approval, whereas a free-limit of US$500,000 will apply to other subprojects."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925005929","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925005929","DocDate":"11-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902273089","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902273089","DocDate":"31-DEC-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101911205645","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101911205645","DocDate":"31-DEC-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7bd54_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7bd54_1_0","DocDate":"28-DEC-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e7bd53_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7bd53_1_0","DocDate":"28-DEC-1976"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
