The benefits will be to provide financing for incremental private sector import needs resulting from the earthquake and for budgetary expenditures related to the recovery effort including social protection priorities. A key objective is to ensure that displaced persons and other groups made vulnerable by the earthquake receive adequate assistance particularly during the upcoming winter months, while longer-term reconstruction efforts get underway. The quick disbursing loan will provide: a) financing for a broad range of specified imports; b) financing of priority components for the earthquake recovery program (by the Government's use of the Lira counterpart of the foreign exchange proceeds); and c) limited funding for technical assistance. The loan is part of a larger assistance package from the Bank designed to complement project financing for reconstruction and disaster mitigation from the restructuring of existing projects and preparation of the Marmara Earthquake Emergency Reconstruction Project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"252,530,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Brief,Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Economic management"],"themecode":"23,54,52","mjthemecode":"6,6,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20050715144818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050715144818","DocDate":"27-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150128145027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150128145027","DocDate":"17-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150128144243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150128144243","DocDate":"17-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01081704011765","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01081704011765","DocDate":"28-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201442726","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201442726","DocURL":"23-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_99112505340269","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99112505340269","DocDate":"27-OCT-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
