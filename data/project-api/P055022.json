The project components will: 1) support the rehabilitation of critical irrigation structures, by upgrading primary canal structures, and sections in deficient state, but critical for the effective operation of major irrigation water conveyance infrastructure systems. Aqueducts, and often siphon structures will undergo rehabilitation works, while specifically, the Armavir irrigation scheme will be improved, by expanding river intake schemes, the main conveyance canal, and secondary canal, and will include construction of sediment control facilities; 2) support the conversion from pump, to gravity irrigation, to reduce the reliance on high-cost energy-intensive irrigation, for those cases where clear technical, and economic viability can de demonstrated; and, 3) create conditions for effective operations, and maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation infrastructure through institutional strengthening, by supporting appropriate institutional reforms. In particular, the Water Supply Agency will be responsible for the O&M of facilities supplying water from major sources, and drainage and irrigation management agencies will be constituted as autonomous regional, or scheme-level O&M enterprises. Additionally, independent consultative, assessment, and liaison contributions to system management will be provided by the Technical Consultative Commission on O&M of the irrigation, and drainage system, and the Irrigation Water Group, this last one to serve as the forum to assist stakeholders with information, conflict resolution, or performance issues."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
