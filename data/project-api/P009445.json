The project will consist of three sub-projects (Gumti Phase I, Naogoan Polder I and Madhumati-Nabaganga), covering an area of 104,500 ha under flood control and drainage (FCD) and 14,350 ha under irrigation. About 115,000 farm families or about 670,000 people will benefit. The project will include: (i) the construction and rehabilitation of embankments, water control structures, drainage channels and irrigation facilities and the upgrading of roads; (ii) support to BWDB to improve the planning, design, and monitoring of FCD projects, and to improve land acquisition and operation and maintenance procedures; and (iii) the preparation of programs for the further development of agriculture and fisheries within the project area."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"48,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961219133852","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219133852","DocDate":"04-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0617d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0617d_1_0","DocDate":"07-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702140242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702140242","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
