The objectives of the project are to: i) increase economic efficiency of the urban road network; and ii) build sustainable road maintenance capacity: institutional, financial and engineering of the project towns and the Ministry of Local Government (MLG) through a program of municipal reforms. The project represents a substantial investment by the government of Kenya's urban centers for the benefit of the national economy. The project will serve to: a)establish adequate maintenance capacity and encourage basic maintenance discipline to all the local authorities and assist the Ministry of Local Government (MLG) to efficiently plan, manage, and finance the maintenance of urban roads; b) improve conditions of the urban roads which are deteriorating rapidly, through a balanced investment program of routine and periodic maintenance, rehabilitation, improved traffic management measures in the project towns; c) direct investment towards those segments of the urban road network in the project towns which are used largely by the poor and improve the latter's access to non-motorized transport facilities; d) introduce measures to increase implementation efficiency through increased use of existing private sector capacity for both construction andmaintenance; and e) improve management, financial and operational practices of the project towns aimed at strengthening their capacity to better finance and maintain road infrastructure."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":74},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"115,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"BH,BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,73,44,74","mjthemecode":"9,4,9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":74},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060117095837","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060117095837","DocDate":"28-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121274401","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121274401","DocURL":"13-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121274000","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121274000","DocDate":"13-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121273699","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121273699","DocURL":"13-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121274000","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121274000","DocURL":"13-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121274401","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121274401","DocDate":"13-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121273699","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121273699","DocDate":"13-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23c2b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23c2b_1_0","DocDate":"30-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019102215","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019102215","DocDate":"03-JAN-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
