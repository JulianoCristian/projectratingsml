It would also prevent pollution in the recipient rivers, and improve the efficiency of the Nairobi City Commission's (NCC) Water and Sewerage Department (WSD). The project would consist of five components. The first, a water supply component, includes; (a) source works, and (b) extension of the water supply system. The sewage treatment plant extension component includes rehabilitation and extension of the Dandora Sewage Treatment Plant as well as staff housing and offices. The third component consists of improvement of water supply and waste disposal facilities in low income residential areas. The fourth component, engineering and construction supervision, provides services for the Dam and Tunnel Safety panel and the Sewerage and Sanitation Master Plan.
