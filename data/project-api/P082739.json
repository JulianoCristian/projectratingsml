The main objectives are to bring fiscal sustainability, reinitiate structural reforms to provide a sustained recovery with enhanced competitiveness, and mitigate the impact of adjustment on priority social investment that protects vulnerable groups.  This fiscal support will help solve the severe short-term liquidity problem, and create fiscal room for smoothing the social costs of adjustment.  The loan is based on structural reform measures that have been implemented by the Government prior to Board presentation.  The project covers two areas: fiscal consolidation, and faster growth with competitiveness.  Under the first area, the following components are considered: overall fiscal framework, revenue management, public expenditure management, public payroll control, and public debt.  Under the second area, the following components are included: competition and trade policies, pricing and regulatory policies of basic infrastructure services for growth, and labor market flexibility."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Power","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"CT,LD,JB,YY,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Economic management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"23,53,27,28,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,2,6,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Other domestic and international trade","code":"YY"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":70},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":10},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":5},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040303114549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040303114549","DocDate":"18-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031816172466","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031816172466","DocDate":"27-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000112742_20030507114617","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20030507114617","DocDate":"28-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03041004025852","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03041004025852","DocDate":"24-APR-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
