The project aims to assist the Council of Higher Education in developing:  (i) a national system of higher-level technician training; and (ii) a system of high-quality technical and vocational teacher education in four Faculties of Technical and Vocational Education (FTVEs).  In addition, the project supports the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (MCT) in developing a national training system for hotel, catering and tourism occupations.  Specifically, the project supports the conversion of 20 outmoded, ill-equipped and inappropriately staffed Vocational Schools of Higher Education (VSHEs) into proper Technician Training Centers (TCCs).  It also supports the expansion and upgrading of existing instructor training programs at the FTVEs to meet a projected shortfall of over 13,400 technical and vocational teachers by 1991, as well as the upgrading and expansion of 10 tourism training centers (TUREMs)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"115,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"BC,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,51,66","mjthemecode":"8,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99041308523623","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99041308523623","DocDate":"24-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926152104","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926152104","DocDate":"07-MAR-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
