Complementary objectives include improving the rehabilitation and maintenance planning performance of the Secretariat for Finance and Public Credit (SCT); and enhancing private sector participation in road maintenance. There are four project components. The first supports the SCT's 2001-2003 programs for highway maintenance and bridge rehabilitation along key segments of the federal highway network. The second component introduces comprehensive maintenance by contract through a pilot program, including technical assistance for design and implementation. This three-year program includes comprehensive maintenance, repair of selected segments of roads and bridges, some minor works preparation of short-term implementation programs, and training and management of the program. The third component constructs vehicle weight control stations. The fourth component supports the implementation of the Highway Development and Management Model in the General Directorate for Maintenance of Roads (DGCC) and its departmental offices; develops a strategy for road decentralization; implements a road financing mechanism; implements a strategy for toll roads; and trains staff in the SCT directorates most involved in the project, emphasizing technical, managerial, and administrative training."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"218,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Social Assessment","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"45,47,44","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,5,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080817234046","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080817234046","DocDate":"28-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99090205405629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99090205405629","DocDate":"24-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0012010530351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0012010530351","DocDate":"17-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Social Assessment (SOA),  Vol.1","DocType":"SOA","EntityID":"000094946_00112805302445","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112805302445","DocDate":"30-AUG-2000"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
