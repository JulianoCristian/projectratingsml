Its key objective is to develop an effective, sustainable, and replicable mechanism--that is fully integrated with the Government's decentralization and public service reform programs and capacity building goals--for strengthening the skills and competencies of those responsible for service delivery and management at the local government level. There are four main project components. The first enhances academic institutional capacity by sponsoring custom-designed workshops and short-term courses, providing specialized training, and develops a resource center on decentralization. This component also finances an academic decision-making mechanism; provides interns with exposure to employment opportunities in districts; and funds project support. The second component funds pilot support to local universities for local government capacity building through curriculum development, establishing a fund for innovative excellence, and supporting a local government staff training pilot and planning unit. The third component enhances decentralization policy research and formulation capacity. The fourth component focuses on general performance monitoring and learning from the pilots by testing changes in the academic environment as well as in service delivery"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"EL,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,66","mjthemecode":"8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":50},{"Name":"Education","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070821091641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070821091641","DocDate":"30-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201283243","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201283243","DocURL":"10-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201283243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201283243","DocDate":"10-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201283142","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201283142","DocURL":"10-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201283142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201283142","DocDate":"10-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02032004020811","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02032004020811","DocDate":"01-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01101904282815","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01101904282815","DocDate":"28-FEB-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
