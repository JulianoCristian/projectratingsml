The project will contribute to the development of the capacity of local communities to implement poverty alleviation and community development activities. There are two main project components. The first component finances small-scale, demand-driven subprojects prepared and submitted by groups of eligible beneficiaries. Income generation subprojects will include projects aiming at agricultural diversification (e.g., raising pigs, chickens, flowers, etc.), and will include small enterprises, artisan workshops, eco-tourism, services such as laundries, processing facilities, community markets, and the like, as well as community development subprojects for activities complementing productive investments such as child care facilities, community centers, and child/youth development, among others. This component also finances technical assistance for subproject identification, preparation, and implementation. The second component strengthens the capacity of local communities to design and implement community development activities and facilitates their participation in overall project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Paraguay!$!PY","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto piloto de desarrollo comunitario </ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Agreement,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PY","sectorcode":"JB,YZ,AZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,53,51,78,76","mjthemecode":"10,10,6,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":25},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20091217232111","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20091217232111","DocDate":"30-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20080310004555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080310004555","DocDate":"29-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_01121708453848","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01121708453848","DocDate":"01-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201570457","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201570457","DocURL":"14-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201570758","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201570758","DocURL":"14-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02030704010785","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02030704010785","DocDate":"04-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01072006081757","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072006081757","DocDate":"26-NOV-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Paraguay"}},"facets":{}}
