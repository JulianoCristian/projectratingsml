The strategic context calls for macroeconomic stability, improved private sector development, and alleviation of infrastructure bottlenecks, and it is within this context that the project will ensure adequate functioning of those sectors. The project time frame will be split in four phases, to include the following components: 1) Project management will be strengthened, to cover overall supervision requirements, including weekly reporting to the Ministry of Scientific Research and Technology. This component include action priority selection, budget issues, and, training to increase awareness on Y2K risks. 2) Public sector systems, will cover the operation of critical information systems, managed by main administrative centers, public administration offices, state-owned enterprises, and, health facilities, including medical instruments. 3) Time constraints will hinder the readiness of all systems by December 31, 1999, hence, contingency plans will: a) globally target severe impacts on infrastructure, and, b) target sector-specific administrative functioning, to minimize potential adversities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"10,150,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"JA,YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48","mjthemecode":"5,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":78},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":12},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050217145247","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050217145247","DocDate":"22-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201095862","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201095862","DocURL":"17-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99101105050085","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99101105050085","DocDate":"05-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99092312090422","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99092312090422","DocDate":"15-SEP-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
