There are four project components: 1) Rehabilitation of main irrigation and drainage works will support repair of head-works, downstream protection works addressing main water supply to the project areas, repairs and replacement of damaged canals, and selective improvement of access roads to the main and secondary irrigation canals and pump stations. 2) Provision of community-based village water supply in selected villages will support construction of tube wells with submersible pumps, and rehabilitation and construction of pump unit in selective water supply pump stations. 3) Institutional capacity building for improved land and water resources management will support improvement of management and operations of main water supply organizations, establishment of water users' associations at the field systems level, strengthening of the Tajikistan University of Agricultural Sciences, and establishment of the Land and Water Resources Management Institute. 4) Strengthening of Project Management and Implementation Unit will support administrative and operational functions."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TJ","sectorcode":"WC,BC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law"],"themecode":"33,82,78","mjthemecode":"10,11,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":67},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":22},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090227012831","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090227012831","DocDate":"23-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201142249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201142249","DocDate":"06-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201142249","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201142249","DocURL":"06-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00061705510768","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00061705510768","DocDate":"25-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00040605324850","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00040605324850","DocDate":"31-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99081506042684","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99081506042684","DocDate":"12-FEB-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tajikistan"}},"facets":{}}
