The joint venture operating company, the SCBO, would manage a 1.1 million ha forest concession and would log 100,000 cubic metres of timber per year. About one-half of this would be exported as logs and the remainder processed as sawnwood and veneer, mostly for export as well. US$10.5 million of the proposed loan would finance investments in the sawmill and veneer plant and technical assistance for their procurement, engineering and initial operation. The project would also support technical assistance to Government services to help ensure the successful regional integration of northern tribal groups into the project and to improve Government's forestry sector management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Congo!$!CG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CG","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925150648","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925150648","DocDate":"25-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902421958","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902421958","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901000892","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901000892","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Congo"}},"facets":{}}
