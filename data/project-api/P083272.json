Fiscal policy will be strengthened, inter alia, by developing medium-term expenditure policy consistent with poverty reduction objectives; strengthening the link between the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the budget; and limiting budget transfers to parastatal enterprises. Financial sector reform will be advanced by taking steps towards strengthening of the financial system, and limiting the risk of bank insolvency; (ii) improving efficiency, accountability, and transparency in public expenditure management. This will be achieved by strengthening budget preparation, execution, and controls, increasing transparency and disclosure including at decentralized levels, and helping ensure better monitoring of and access to basic services by the poor."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Program Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"AI,BG,FZ,YB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Economic management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,23,43,27,40","mjthemecode":"4,2,4,1,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":65},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":12},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060822100217","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060822100217","DocDate":"16-AUG-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050512163040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050512163040","DocDate":"11-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2010031114362005","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010031114362005","DocURL":"25-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000021321_2010031114362005","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010031114362005","DocDate":"25-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000090341_20050302085652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050302085652","DocDate":"22-FEB-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
