The loan would provide financing for:  (a) highway civil works; (b) procurement of equipment for investment and maintenance works; and (c) consultancy services and training.  The project is designed to assist KGM in the following areas: (i) project planning, preparation and implementation; (ii) development of a modern and more balanced equipment fleet for its investment and maintenance works; (iii) pavements research and management; and (iv) staff training and highway safety.  The project would lead to savings in transport and highway maintenance costs and would promote highway safety.  Savings would accrue especially on quick benefit yielding routes, which also generate foreign exchange earnings because of transit and export traffic.  There are no unusual technical risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"186,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925204621","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925204621","DocDate":"17-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99acc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99acc_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902440664","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902440664","DocDate":"31-MAY-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
