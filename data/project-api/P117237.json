The DPO contributes to a number of key outcomes of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). Notably, the DPO's focus on the investment climate should allow improved performance on the doing business indicators, one of the CPS outcome indicators measuring progress towards sustainable growth in the real sector of the economy-a key objective of the government under the seven-point agenda. Also, the DPO supports improvements in auditing and accounting, budget planning and better procurement which are outcomes under the CPS pillar for governance for results. The main policy areas supported are: a) maintaining fiscal sustainability; b) improving the quality of spending; and c) strengthening the investment climate. There are four main risks potentially associated with the program as: 1) macroeconomic; 2) state risk; 3) country risk; and 4) governance risk.
