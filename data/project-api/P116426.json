The rationale for the restructuring includes: a) scaling up activities that have performed satisfactory and where the Ministry of Education and Training (MoET) has demonstrated capacity to deliver; b) scaling down activities that have performed poorly after corrective actions aimed at strengthening MoET's implementation capacity were implemented; and c) strengthening the overall capacity of the MoET to deliver the project results by addressing management and implementation bottlenecks that cut across the components of the project."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of
