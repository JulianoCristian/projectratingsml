In light of these, the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya's (NEB) immediate concern is to maximize the operational efficiency of its existing facilities and optimize the use of the country's energy resources.  The Energy Efficiency and Plant Rehabilitation Project seeks to achieve these objectives, through emphasis on improving the efficiency of thermal power stations, replacing oil with natural gas as the primary fuel for power generation, introducing a more effective maintenance management system for thermal and hydro power plants, rationalizing the transmission system, modernizing system operation and control, and furthering specific institutional capabilities.  The project specifically includes:  (a) rehabilitation of 1,290 MW of plant at Tuanku Jaafar, Prai and Sultan Iskandar from oil to oil/gas firing; and (c) introduction of computerized maintenance management systems at all major thermal and hydro stations.  It also provides for the (d) modernization of the national load dispatch center; (e) installation of regional distribution control centers; (f) installation of transmission lines; (g) installation of nine substations; and (h) technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Malaysia!$!MY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MY","sectorcode":"PP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment","code":"PP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019211455","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019211455","DocDate":"23-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091601","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091601","DocDate":"30-NOV-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926031027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926031027","DocDate":"25-NOV-1986"}],"countryname":"Malaysia"}},"facets":{}}
