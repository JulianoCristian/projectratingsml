The project has the following six components: Component 1) a favorable environment within which financial institutions operate is a necessary condition for a successful restructuring of the financial sector. Two areas have been identified as retarding factors in the development of financial institutions: Government arrears and the legal/judiciary framework. In addition, the lack of financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains a concern and an issue is how to make the environment more conducive to SME financing.
