This project has two components: project financing and sub-project transaction development. The financing component supports sub-projects in mobilizing adequate debt financing if they meet funding eligibility criteria, where the sub-project sponsors have reached the limit of mobilizing market-based financing. It is expected that the sub-projects will be structured as build-operate-own (BOO) or build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects (or variations thereof), and financed on a limited recourse basis. Transaction development is a government-led function involving initiatives by project agencies, line ministries, and other parastatals. Technical assistance will be available to Bangladesh agencies and line ministries to promote private sector participation, both at a policy level and to promote specific transactions.  Assistance is also required by line managers and ministries prior to transactions, to establish proper framework and policies, identify viable sub-projects, and carry out feasibility studies. During transactions, assistance is required to conduct competitive and transparent procurement processes, market sub-projects to encourage good competition among quality sponsors, and manage the entire process of structuring, documentation, bidding, negotiations, and concession awards. After award, a core advisory services unit will be set up to continuously assist the private sector developer and the public sector counterpart agency with the project's timely construction, operation, and regulation."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":31},"sector2":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":30},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"235,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Environmental Assessment,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"BC,LC,CT,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,44,39,40","mjthemecode":"4,4,4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":31},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":30},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080829001058","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080829001058","DocDate":"30-JAN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000012009_20050218093912","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050218093912","DocDate":"10-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.5","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01042609222980","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01042609222980","DocDate":"30-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030309551261","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030309551261","DocDate":"14-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980313101640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980313101640","DocDate":"07-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185020","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185020","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3971104184818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971104184818","DocDate":"31-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062811103462","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062811103462","DocDate":"20-NOV-1995"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
