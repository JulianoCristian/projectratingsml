The proposed PRSC-2 will support the policies and reforms aimed at improving the living conditions of the population by promoting growth, incomes and employment, accelerating human resource development, and strengthening governance and public sector management as spelled out in the country's GPRS. The second PRSC would lay the ground for helping the country to attack poverty in a comprehensive manner. It is envisaged that there will be a further single- tranche PRSC in FY05. The PRSC-2 is expected to provide a series of  benefits. The main and ultimate benefit is the human progress towards the Millennium Development Goals expected from the growth and service delivery outcomes when this project is implemented. In addition, there are two intermediate benefits. The first is helping maintain macroeconomic stability by contributing to the closing of  the external financing gap. The second is enabling the Government to generate the funds required to execute GPRS policies and programs.  There are four risks to the success of the program: (1) the government is  unable to sustain its current fiscal stance in the run up to the December 2004 elections; (2) the macro-financial context may deteriorate and make program implementation difficult as a result of  exogenous shocks such as adverse terms of trade or increasing regional instability; (3) fiduciary weaknesses may limit the impact of  the program; and (4) capacity limitations may lead to . only partial implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":11},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":23},"theme5":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"125,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"YZ,JB,EZ,JA,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"53,27,25,67,65","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,8,2,2,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070531135706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070531135706","DocDate":"17-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060105134354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060105134354","DocDate":"14-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010030110275243","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030110275243","DocURL":"15-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010030110275243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030110275243","DocDate":"15-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20040628172140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040628172140","DocDate":"07-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20040219090246","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040219090246","DocDate":"18-FEB-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
