There are three main project components. The first component strengthens health services delivery at the district level, as part of the policy of the Ministry of Public Health and Population to operationalize a District Health System (DHS) by upgrading district hospitals and health centers in eight districts and ensuring the effective delivery of a package of integrated maternal and child (PIMAC) health services together with supporting the decentralization of resource management. The second component improves the effectiveness of public health programs by strengthening two critical programs, namely, malaria and health education. It finances civil works for minor renovations of referral laboratories, proivides equipment and supplies for laboratories and vector control and disease surveillance, computers and vehicles, emergency stocks of essential drugs and insecticide treated materials, staff training, etc. The third component supports human resources development in the areas of financial analysis and health systems management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Malaria","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"27,530,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Health Sector Review,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance","Human development","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"67,92,63,26,69","mjthemecode":"8,2,8,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Malaria","code":"92"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100303230746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100303230746","DocDate":"23-FEB-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123591612","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123591612","DocURL":"23-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02031504141247","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02031504141247","DocDate":"06-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01051204053035","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01051204053035","DocDate":"30-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02021404091571","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02021404091571","DocDate":"21-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_01120704070745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01120704070745","DocDate":"28-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Health Sector Review (HSR),  Vol.1","DocType":"HSR","EntityID":"000333038_20080702032017","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080702032017","DocDate":"01-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052710441365","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052710441365","DocDate":"19-NOV-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
