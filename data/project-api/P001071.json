Three components constitute the core of the program. First, there is social policy planning. The project will support the strengthening of the Human Resources and Social Policy Division (DHRPS). The DHRPS will be responsible for carrying out studies on important issues of social policy and integrating the results of these studies, and the results of the household survey, into the design of social policy and of the adjustment program. The second component involves monitoring living standards. The Direction Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Information will be strengthened by the creation of a new Survey and Price Indices Division which will organize and implement a permanent household survey to track the evolution of living standards through the adjustment process. The third component is the creation of a pilot program of sub-projects for socio-economic development. This program will be managed by a new Pilot Project Unit. The Unit will be responsible for appraising, and monitoring poverty-alleviation sub-projects to be financed under the program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"sector2":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":18},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":18},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":18},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":18},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"JA,EZ,FE,EV,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"41,61,57,78,55","mjthemecode":"6,10,7,7,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28},{"Name":"Education","Percent":18},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":18},{"Name":"Education","Percent":18},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":18}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214141918","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214141918","DocDate":"06-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010043015482509","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010043015482509","DocDate":"22-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031212032510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031212032510","DocDate":"19-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07f7d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07f7d_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927154259","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927154259","DocDate":"06-MAR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927154050","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927154050","DocDate":"06-MAR-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
