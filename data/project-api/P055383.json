The six-month extension of the closing date, will enable the completion of all remaining activities, help ensure disbursement of remaining funds, and allow for successful achievement of the project development objective (PDO). It will also help to ensure sustainability of investments completed so far since the Government, due to the current fiscal constraints, may not be able to support the remaining investments from the state budget. There are no proposed changes to the PDO or results framework. The project's financial management is currently rated satisfactory, reflecting overall appropriate financial management arrangements and adoption of all previous recommendations for further system strengthening. There are no outstanding audit reports for the project and the last one presented an unqualified opinion.
