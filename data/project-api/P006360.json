The main objectives of this Program are: (a) to develop private irrigation in the highlands; (b) to decentralize planning and execution of irrigation investments; and (c) to prepare policies and an organizational framework for continued expansion. The project will comprise three main components: (1) construction of electric power distribution lines for pumping, mainly along water courses; (2) construction of public drainage, small dams and other water control structures; and (3) institutional development. On-farm development will be financed through existing lines of credit and supported by institutional development."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":71},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"195,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Renewable energy"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BC,AI,LE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,86,26,82","mjthemecode":"11,2,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":71},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":21},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_9903191055313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903191055313","DocDate":"17-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032211415162","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032211415162","DocDate":"21-SEP-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926214727","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926214727","DocDate":"16-MAY-1988"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
