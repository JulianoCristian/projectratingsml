The employment and training program will: (a) develop employment information and services to promote labor mobility; (b) improve occupational training for adults by providing support for a labor market based training system with strong links to private and public employers; and (c) initiate reform of vocational secondary schooling by developing new curricula with more general education and broader training to replace the out-dated and narrow curricula currently used in vocational schools.  The higher education and research program will:  (a) support the introduction of competition-based grant funding for higher education programs according to criteria which emphasize greater collaboration and resource sharing among institutions of higher education and research and new interdisciplinary programs; (b) develop a program of practically oriented foreign language training; and (c) support development of human resources for science and technology by earmarking a portion of the competition-based National Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) for younger researchers, refurbishing the stock of and improving the management of the centers of scientific instrumentation financed by OTKA, and upgrading the national research and development computer network used by academic and industrial researchers."},"country_namecode":"Hungary!$!HU","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":16},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":59},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HU","sectorcode":"ET,EV,ES,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48,51,65,66","mjthemecode":"8,8,6,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Education","Percent":23},{"Name":"Education","Percent":16},{"Name":"Education","Percent":59}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980513111653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980513111653","DocDate":"31-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200062693","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200062693","DocURL":"29-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200062693","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200062693","DocDate":"29-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930060550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930060550","DocDate":"31-MAR-1991"}],"countryname":"Hungary"}},"facets":{}}
