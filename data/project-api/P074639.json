The Bank's involvement will address the immediate post-conflict needs of the country; and provide the development leadership needed for reengagement of the international community in a country in the delicate and troubled Central Africa region. Building on ongoing Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) activities in the country, this project will also help formulate a comprehensive Demobilization and Reintegration Program (DDR) in Congo by setting up necessary framework to build on donors' support for the DDR program. The project will contribute to ongoing efforts to consolidate peace and strengthen security in the Republic of Congo, while offering sound reintegration options to ex-combatants who joined the ranks of the unemployed after the signing of the cease-fire agreement. The credit will complement support provided by other donors and the Bank's ongoing Post-conflict Grant for the Reintegration of Women and Youth."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Congo!$!CG","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Technical Annex","countrycode":"CG","sectorcode":"BC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Rural development","Urban development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,56,71,78,23","mjthemecode":"1,10,9,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":70},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050909123510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050909123510","DocDate":"27-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201243868","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201243868","DocURL":"08-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01072006081960","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072006081960","DocDate":"16-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_01072104010597","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072104010597","DocDate":"06-JUL-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Congo"}},"facets":{}}
