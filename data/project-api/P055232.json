The project components are as follows. The first component will increase access to, and quality of initial, pre-school, and secondary education for children in rural areas. Initial, and pre-school education will have a non-formal approach to education, focused not only on children, but on parents and siblings within a family, and community framework. Trained community educators, fluent in the local languages will provide initial education, and, interventions combining formal, and non-formal approaches will follow for pre-school, which includes the introduction to the Spanish language. Distance secondary education will be developed (in addition to traditional school delivery) through cost-effective information and communication technologies, and teacher training assistance. The second component focuses on the quality of teaching, and learning in primary schools in the targeted rural areas, supporting continuous professional development focused on rural teachers, developing, and distributing multi-grade, and bilingual instruction materials, and, rehabilitating classrooms. The third component will support the reform of teacher policy, and education management, motivating linkages towards educational standards, by supporting schools development, within the national assessment system, through strategic analysis and policy research."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de educaci\u00f3n rural </ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector2":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"52,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Indigenous Peoples Plan,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"EP,ES,ET,EC,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,65,60","mjthemecode":"7,8,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080805013808","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080805013808","DocDate":"25-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051114375748","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051114375748","DocDate":"05-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031710171350","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031710171350","DocDate":"05-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2010031710171350","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031710171350","DocURL":"05-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20030509102442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030509102442","DocDate":"30-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03050704115790","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03050704115790","DocDate":"28-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000094946_02061304435133","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02061304435133","DocDate":"31-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0112210401302","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0112210401302","DocDate":"10-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01122104030511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01122104030511","DocDate":"01-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061111351049","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061111351049","DocDate":"06-AUG-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
