This document changes in the components, in the results framework and monitoring table, in the institutional arrangements and in the Project costs and allocation of proceeds of AF for the Third Integrated Financial Management Technical Assistance Project (the Project), as described in: (a) the project paper on a AF Loan in the Amount of US$20.0 Million to the Republic of Guatemala, dated March 4, 2008; (b) the Loan Agreement providing AF for the Project between the Republic of Guatemala (the Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) (the AF Loan Agreement); and (c) the AF implementation letter, as defined in appendix one to the Loan Agreement. Adjustments are required due to several reasons including a delayed start to project activities stemming from slower than anticipated congressional approval of AF to the project, the need to strengthen SIAF's capacity to address some issues arising from the global economic crisis, as well as the need to reinforce the consolidation of SIAF with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) prior to loan closure in mid 2011. The results framework includes some new or modified indicators or specific benchmarks. The project objectives remain the same. The AF Loan Agreement and the AF implementation letter will be amended accordingly."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
