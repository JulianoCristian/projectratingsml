The project consists of three components.  The first component, designed to increase the quality of primary education, will:  (a) simplify the primary school curriculum and make it more relevant; (b) provide improved teacher instructional materials, textbooks and supplementary materials; and (c) institutionalize a teacher supervision, support and training system.  The second component, designed to improve access to educational resources, will: (a) strengthen the non-formal primary education and literacy programs; (b) offer an increased opportunity to receive a basic education to girls, the very poor, and those in remote areas; and (c) construct and/or renovate primary school classrooms to accommodate the increase in enrollment.  The third component, designed to improve the institutional development of the subsector, will:  (a) strengthen the Ministry of Education's capacity to plan, manage and monitor its formal and non-formal primary education program; (b) assist in the development of its capacity to coordinate and manage donor-aided projects; and (c) improve the design of efficient classroom facilities."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":27},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"sector4":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"30,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NP","sectorcode":"EL,BC,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,59,65,78","mjthemecode":"10,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":70},{"Name":"Education","Percent":27},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Education","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00062905302320","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00062905302320","DocDate":"10-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e394cd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e394cd_1_0","DocDate":"21-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002042650","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002042650","DocDate":"27-MAR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002042525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002042525","DocDate":"27-MAR-1992"}],"countryname":"Nepal"}},"facets":{}}
