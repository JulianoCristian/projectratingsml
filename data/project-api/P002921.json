The agricultural development aspect of the project includes the rehabilitation of the irrigation system and the reestablishment of an outgrower production scheme to augment can supplies to the factory.  The project also intends to strengthen the Ministry of Industry and Technology's (MOI) role in monitoring the performance of the sugar industry and advising the Government on industry policy matters.  The project will, over a six year period:  (i) restore KSW's sugar production from present zero level to historical levels (85,000 tsy) and save foreign exchange used for imports; (ii) strengthen MOI's management of the sugar sector; and (iii) provide a mechanism for liberalizing sugar marketing and pricing."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"24,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019212101","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019212101","DocDate":"25-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050416515423","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050416515423","DocDate":"11-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031014172722","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031014172722","DocDate":"11-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e07eda_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07eda_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07ed8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07ed8_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926122354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926122354","DocDate":"07-MAR-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
