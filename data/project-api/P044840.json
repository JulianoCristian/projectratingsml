There are three components. The first component improves delivery of basic services by rehabilitating village and social infrastructure in rural communities through micro-projects twinned with programs to improve services. The second component leverages project resources to finance small innovative micro-project/programs to address the programs associated with the institutionalization of children and the evolving problems of children caused by economic or social dislocations, including parental neglect. The third component targets community groups, local nongovernmental organizations, local contractors, and local government to build capacity in skills and relationships, and to foster new community-government partnerships in the management of social and economic infrastructure."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":24},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":22},"sector5":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MD","sectorcode":"BZ,WZ,EZ,TA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,56,70,78","mjthemecode":"10,8,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":24},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":22},{"Name":"Education","Percent":22},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050601144750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050601144750","DocDate":"23-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042910383383","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042910383383","DocDate":"03-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060110162684","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060110162684","DocDate":"30-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060110055769","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060110055769","DocDate":"08-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99030406215178","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99030406215178","DocDate":"11-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703525434","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703525434","DocDate":"10-SEP-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Moldova"}},"facets":{}}
