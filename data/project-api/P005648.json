It will consist of: (i) constructing new, and expanding and improving existing, water supply systems in about 150 rural and semi-urban centers; (ii) providing credit facilities to low-income groups to help finance water pipe connections from main pipes to dwellings; and (iii) installing about 80,000 water meters in dwellings newly connected to the supply system. Benefits of the project will accrue mostly to low-income groups, namely about 480,000 inhabitants who will be provided with running water in their dwellings, and about 150,000 rural dwellers who will get access to safe water from public standpipes."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Rural water supply and sanitation","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Rural water supply and sanitation"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"WR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Rural water supply and sanitation","code":"WR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925122107","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925122107","DocDate":"01-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902392720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902392720","DocDate":"30-APR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e973c1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e973c1_1_0","DocDate":"27-APR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e973be_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e973be_1_0","DocDate":"27-APR-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
