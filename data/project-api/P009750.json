The power station will be constructed in the vicinity of the South Godavari coal fields in the State of Andhra Pradesh. Its generation capacity is expected to reach 2,100 MW -- comprising three 200 MW and three 500 MW generating units -- by July 1987. The first 200 MW unit is expected to be commissioned by July 1, 1983, and the commissioning of the remaining two 200 MW units will follow at six-month intervals. The principal components of the project include civil works; three 200 MW turbo-generating units and three 680 tonnes-per-hour boilers, complete with all auxiliaries, and ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment; coal transportation and handling equipment; and about 1,200 km of 400 kV transmission line, together with associated equipment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924181522","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924181522","DocDate":"03-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000371432_20140807151747","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000371432_20140807151747","DocDate":"07-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3ec_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3ec_1_0","DocDate":"04-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3ea_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3ea_1_0","DocDate":"04-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd03e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd03e_1_0","DocDate":"04-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd03d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd03d_1_0","DocDate":"04-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd037_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd037_1_0","DocDate":"04-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c4a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c4a_1_0","DocDate":"04-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912412672","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912412672","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902314981","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902314981","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
