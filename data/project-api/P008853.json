The project consists of two major components: 1) an air pollution abatement component which will provide fuel conversion loans to about 6,500 households and about 65 boilerhouse operators during the three years over which the Bank loan will be disbursed. These loans will be used to finance the conversion of heating and hot water systems currently using polluting fuels to the use of cleaner fuels; and 2) a geographical information system (GIS) component which will include the following: (a) the establishment of a central Geographical Information Center; (b) the establishment of a market development group to promote the use of GIS, to provide training (in the use of GIS), to raise market awareness on exchange of data and to provide assistance to regional administrations, government agencies and departments, and domestic and foreign industrial, commercial and service users; (c) the establishment of formal standards (in line with international standards) on data collection, use and maintenance of data and quality assurance compliance group to ensure that the information system operates in accordance with international standards; and (d) the establishment of a local training center in order to develop local expertise in the operation of GIS."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Slovenia!$!SI","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":87},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rule of law","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"23,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"SI","sectorcode":"BC,LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,81,37,84","mjthemecode":"11,3,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other rule of law","code":"37"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":87},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0202020404220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0202020404220","DocDate":"21-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200241191","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200241191","DocURL":"18-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200241090","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200241090","DocDate":"18-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200241090","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200241090","DocURL":"18-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200241292","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200241292","DocURL":"18-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022111245","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022111245","DocDate":"01-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2006061412575240","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2006061412575240","DocDate":"04-OCT-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Slovenia"}},"facets":{}}
