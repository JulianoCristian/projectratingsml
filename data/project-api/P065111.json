There are three components to the project, the first component being revitalizing Aden economy and business clusters. This component will support local economic development by creating and reinforcing business linkages within the city, upgrading industrial and commercial areas serving micro and small-scale enterprises, and rehabilitating commercial districts with the aim of revitalizing existing businesses and triggering new private sector investment. The second component is the port cities strategic and physical planning. This component will finance the formulation of City Development Strategy (CDS) strategies for Aden, Hodeidah and Mukalla, including competitiveness assessments, cluster strategies, participatory workshops, and other work that will help to form and reinforce a shared vision of each city. Financing will also support an update of the master plans in the participating port cities, including several inter-related physical planning studies necessary to underpin city development strategies. Finally, the third component is the Aden local capacity building and administrative modernization.  Underpinning Aden's strategic and physical planning efforts and revitalization program, this component will include a series of capacity building measures focused on improving the efficiency and transparency of public services provided to the private sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government
