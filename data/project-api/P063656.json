Project components call for: 1) elimination of most of the remaining block substations, to be replaced by the installation of building-level individual substations, automated to reduce energy consumption, and to convert the system from a supply, to a demand-driven operation model; 2) rehabilitation of heat-only-boilers, by either replacement with new boilers, or new burners and pumps, and, installation of heat exchangers, and related equipment, depending on each case priority, to reduce fuel consumption, operating costs, and emissions; 3) combined heat and power plant rehabilitation, with a new process control, and instrumental system, to improve reliability, and efficiency. Environmentally friendly low-Nox burner units, should be adjusted for both mazut, and gas firing to reduce emissions, and an additional feed water pump unit should improve plant reliability. Hydraulic and lubrication systems for the turbo-generator will improve reliability, and control, while frequency controlled district heating pumps would adjust the plant demand-driven variable water flow operation mode, and, a regenerative air pre-heater would improve efficiency; and, 4) technical assistance to improve management information systems, covering accounting procedures, financial management, and customer databases to enable prompt processing, and managerial information to enhance cost control, and monitoring. Project management will assist with procurement, supervision, and management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Lithuania!$!LT","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"17,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"LT","sectorcode":"LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,43,74,27","mjthemecode":"2,9,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00012505454658","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00012505454658","DocDate":"11-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01080904110847","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01080904110847","DocDate":"27-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01040305301640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01040305301640","DocDate":"22-MAR-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Lithuania"}},"facets":{}}
