The main project components are two.  First, the Natural Resources Management Operations component comprises two sub-components: (a) the project will finance Participatory Development Plans (PDP) prepared by local communities, assisted by the Regional Agricultural Development Offices (CRDA) technical staff, to address their priorities for soil and water conservation, agricultural and pastoral development, small-scale irrigation systems and other rural infrastructure, and women's support activities; and (b) the project will finance erosion control and water recharge investments in the three related CRDA's, mainly on public lands, as part of the government's national soil and water conservation strategy, to protect the areas where a participatory approach will be tested. The second component, Institutional Strengthening, at both the CRDA and central levels, will support Ministry of Agriculture human resources and information systems development, and adjust the incentive framework for sustainable resources management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":16},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"26,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"BH,BC,AI,AH,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,83,57,79,26","mjthemecode":"2,10,7,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":43},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":31},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":16},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000442464_20131118102327","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20131118102327","DocDate":"06-NOV-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050103123406","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050103123406","DocDate":"30-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123134623","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123134623","DocURL":"19-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182816","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182816","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3970818103038","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818103038","DocDate":"15-APR-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
