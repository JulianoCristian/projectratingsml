The development objectives of the PDPG 4-6 are to protect basic services within a sustainable fiscal framework, and to lay the foundation for post-crisis recovery and growth. The series combines actions to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis by protecting core spending on health, education, and social safety nets and to continue with structural reforms. PDPG 4 focuses on protecting the gains made under PDPG 1-3 and hence includes budget allocations for the social sectors as prior actions. However, PDPG 5-6 will (flexibly, since the duration of crisis impact is not known) increasingly emphasize structural reforms. Specifically, to protect basic services, PDPG 4 will support the ring-fencing of expenditures for health, education, and social protection services at no less than 2009 levels. PDPG 5 and 6 will support reforms to improve the efficiency and targeting of social expenditures. To promote post-crisis recovery and growth, the series will support reforms to improve the investment climate by reducing the regulatory burden on business, strengthen the financial sector, and liberalize the aviation sector to foster Tajikistan's links to the regional and global economies, and restructure farmland and promote farmer control over management and agricultural diversification. In addition, the series will continue the governance reforms initiated under the previous series to enhance public sector effectiveness, strengthen public financial management, and enhance accountability and performance of state-owned energy utilities. The first operation under the new series will provide SDR 16.9 million, including SDR 5.7 millio"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":33},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"Aviation","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":44},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"25,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Aviation"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"TJ","sectorcode":"TV,EP,AZ,JB,FZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"27,40,77","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Aviation","code":"TV"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":33},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":23},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":22},{"Name":"Education","Percent":11},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20140305113017","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20140305113017","DocDate":"25-FEB-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010100515182701","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010100515182701","DocDate":"07-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100602021210","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100602021210","DocDate":"26-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20091110141358","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20091110141358","DocDate":"22-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000020953_20100510152526","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20100510152526","DocDate":"22-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100507100729","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100507100729","DocDate":"22-OCT-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tajikistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
