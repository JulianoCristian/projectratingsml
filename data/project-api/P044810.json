The overall results of the project should provide a solid foundation for protecting against corruption and improving governance in the country. There are five project components. The first component strengthens court administration and reduces delays, improves case management, installs a court management information system and automation, provides training and upgrading of training facilities, provides other human resource needs that raise the stature of the judiciary and regulate the court performance of all levels of the judiciary, and upgrades court infrastructure. The second component improves access to justice by raising the level of gender sensitivity; developing an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, strengthening small cause courts, and improving access to legal aid; and promoting legal literacy and public awareness at the grassroots level, on a national level, and through the bar associations. The third, fourth, and fifth components strengthen the law commission and the ministry of law, finance studies that prepare for future reforms, and support project implementation."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal services","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Access to law and justice","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"30,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"BG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rule of law","Rule of law","Rule of law","Rule of law"],"themecode":"31,35,33,32,59","mjthemecode":"7,3,3,3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Legal services","code":"35"},{"name":"Access to law and justice","code":"31"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20100714004114","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100714004114","DocDate":"14-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123582676","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123582676","DocURL":"30-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123582877","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123582877","DocURL":"30-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0103200658247","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0103200658247","DocDate":"01-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101806","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101806","DocDate":"18-FEB-1997"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
