The specific objectives are: (i) to strengthen the quality and efficiency of basic education, with a view to raising student achievement; (ii) to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and responsiveness of technical and vocational education and training (TVET); and (iii) to reinforce employment services and labor market information. To these ends, the project includes the following components: (a) the general education support component aims to reinforce the basic education foundation by improving the quality of services and raising internal efficiency. The project supports the expansion of innovative and cost effective instructional strategies such as multi-grade teaching and school-based training; (b) the TVET development component aims to increase the effectiveness of TVET programs through the provision of key inputs to the learning process and to raise efficiency through increased sharing of facilities, expanded use of program view/evaluation procedures, and introduction of user fees in post-secondary education. Responsiveness would be improved through the introduction of flexible curricula, enhanced capabilities to evaluate performance and to design/implement new programs, provision of incentives to post-secondary institutions to enter into training contracts with industry, and increased accountability of institutions."},"country_namecode":"Barbados!$!BB","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"7,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BB","sectorcode":"BC,EP,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Human development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"65,66,51","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":57},{"Name":"Education","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01072804135088","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072804135088","DocDate":"22-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122593274","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122593274","DocURL":"18-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122593274","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122593274","DocDate":"18-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171632","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171632","DocDate":"04-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170521","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170521","DocDate":"04-JUN-1993"}],"countryname":"Barbados","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
