The DR is a middle income country on the eastern part of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti. With a population of 9.8 million and a land area of 48,700 sq km, it is on both dimensions the second largest country in the Caribbean, after Cuba.

The current global recession is taking a large toll on the economy by increasing debt servicing costs and weakening growth, income from tourism, and remittances.

The government's reform program has become urgent, as the country's present economic and fiscal trajectory is not sustainable. Its importance is evident. External financing constraints have materialized and interest rate spreads on the DR internation"},"country_namecode":"Dominican Republic!$!DO","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":37},"sector2":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":27},"sector3":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":18},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":9},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":31},"theme2":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":31},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":6},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":19},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"DO","sectorcode":"BC,JA,LZ,LT,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Economic management","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,28,54,23,24","mjthemecode":"1,1,6,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":37},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":27},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":18},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000442464_20130710094501","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130710094501","DocDate":"27-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20111011234220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20111011234220","DocDate":"30-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022609540846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022609540846","DocDate":"26-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010041914525917","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010041914525917","DocDate":"18-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100519053419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100519053419","DocDate":"13-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000350881_20091103111355","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20091103111355","DocDate":"13-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000101930_20091013101556","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000101930_20091013101556","DocDate":"07-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000101930_20091020174939","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000101930_20091020174939","DocDate":"07-OCT-2009"}],"countryname":"Dominican Republic"}},"facets":{}}
