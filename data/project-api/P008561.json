The project will comprise two components: 1) an enterprise sector strengthening component (ESSC); and 2) a financial sector strengthening component (FSSC). The ESSC will facilitate the growth of a population of viable and competitive enterprises by providing technical assistance for rationalizing selected larger enterprises and by providing private SMEs with the technical assistance necessary to prepare bankable investment projects. The ESSC will also provide computer hardware and software to assist in strengthening the ability of the tax administration within the Ministry of Finance to collect taxes in a timely fashion and lower transaction costs. The FSSC will provide resources -a credit line- through qualified participating banks, for medium-term loans to private and privatized enterprises. This component will also: 1) assist with the development of banking skills in the participating banks; 2) strengthen the payments system through the provision of computer software and hardware for the clearing center at the National Bank of Moldova (NBM); and 3) support further institutional developmen"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":6},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"MD","sectorcode":"FG,BC,FA,YW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"41,44","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","code":"FG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":85},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":6},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0301220440276","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0301220440276","DocDate":"23-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200223833","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200223833","DocURL":"17-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200223732","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200223732","DocDate":"17-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200223531","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200223531","DocDate":"17-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200223430","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200223430","DocURL":"17-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200223833","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200223833","DocDate":"17-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200223430","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200223430","DocDate":"17-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacbab_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacbab_1_0","DocDate":"08-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019120407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019120407","DocDate":"17-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061614173810","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061614173810","DocDate":"21-APR-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Moldova"}},"facets":{}}
