Two of the project provinces - Hunan and Guangxi - are relatively poor, and project investments are expected to promote economic development there by helping to create new jobs, increase incomes and reduce poverty. The project's multisectoral strategy is consistent with the financial goals of the Government's IWW reforms policies, and addresses the lack of intersectoral coordination that reduced the IWW network in the past."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
