The project also seeks to strengthen the capability of local agencies to assist poor communities; mobilize informal and private sector local institutions and expertise; encourage broader participation in decisionmaking about community matters; and provide equal opportunity to men and women. The project funds subprojects, providing revolving capital for income generation and grants for basic infrastructure works; economic activities including activities in urban agriculture, group training in the communities, sewing machine or computer equipment, programs for children and youth, community-based housing, and family planning education; and related employment activities such as training programs. Also provided is technical assistance for implementation and monitoring, specifically for project management, oversight consultants, and facilitators."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":18},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":18},"sector4":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":17},"sector5":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Housing construction"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"YC,YZ,BH,JB,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,73,57,44","mjthemecode":"4,7,9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":18},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":18},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":17},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050701130533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050701130533","DocDate":"28-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201053668","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201053668","DocURL":"28-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201053567","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201053567","DocDate":"28-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201053567","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201053567","DocURL":"28-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201053668","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201053668","DocDate":"28-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99051205324528","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99051205324528","DocDate":"19-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173753","DocDate":"18-AUG-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
