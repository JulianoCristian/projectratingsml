It supports the first stage of a major reform of basic education, aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the education system, and at enhancing equity of access to educational opportunities. To these ends, a dual strategy will be pursued. The first part seeks to strengthen the planning and institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education to guide and carry out the long-term development of the sector, while enabling it to initiate significant, urgent measures to address system-wide qualitative problems and expansion needs at the secondary level. As a second, integral part of the strategy, the project catalyzes a major adjustment process, focused on revision to more reasonable levels of primary and secondary teacher to student ratios, in line with ratios of countries at similar levels of economic and social development. Such adjustment is critical to ensure that already relatively high levels of resource allocations to public education better respond to current and projected needs, including increased financing for system management and educational equipment and supplies, and school facilities and equipment maintenance - all of which are areas presently significantly underfinanced."},"country_namecode":"St. Lucia!$!LC","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":33},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":27},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"6,720,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"LC","sectorcode":"BC,ET,EP,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,71,65,66","mjthemecode":"8,8,9,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":33},{"Name":"Education","Percent":32},{"Name":"Education","Percent":27},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01060804031385","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060804031385","DocDate":"30-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123345319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123345319","DocDate":"23-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123345118","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123345118","DocDate":"23-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123345319","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123345319","DocURL":"23-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123345118","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123345118","DocURL":"23-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b467_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b467_1_0","DocDate":"24-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b464_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b464_1_0","DocDate":"24-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3da3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3da3_1_0","DocDate":"24-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007102013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007102013","DocDate":"22-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052714484513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052714484513","DocDate":"16-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052714470412","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052714470412","DocDate":"09-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"St. Lucia"}},"facets":{}}
