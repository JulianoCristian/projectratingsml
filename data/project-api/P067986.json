The components will support: 1) an emergency reconstruction of the Ministry of Health (MOH) hospital network in the earthquake affected areas, through a phased construction that will meet current seismic structural codes. Equipment supply will include computerization, medical waste disposal equipment, and medical equipment. Technical assistance (TA) will be financed to cover environmental impact studies, topographical analyses, and engineering drawings; 2) the extension of essential health and nutrition services to damaged, and poor areas, by forming partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, and local government agencies, to strengthen MOH capacity, towards an integrated service delivery of health and nutrition services. Participatory outreach programs with communities will be established, including the development of management reforms in those reconstructed hospitals, to establish accountability systems, and health coverage in rural areas; 3) strengthening of MOH's capacity to perform public health programs, with improved quality and disease surveillance, regulation and performance-based monitoring; and, 4) project management, including the project's overall impact evaluation, and financial audits."},"country_namecode":"Republic of El Salvador!$!SV","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto Reconstrucci\u00f3n de Emergencia por Terremoto y Extensi\u00f3n de Servicios de Salud en El Salvador</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"142,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Executive Director's Statement,Executive Director's Statement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"SV","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"69,52,67,68,26","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8,8,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20120405011618","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120405011618","DocDate":"23-MAR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011071306494487","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011071306494487","DocDate":"13-JUL-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022017124705","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022017124705","DocDate":"20-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_01121708453547","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01121708453547","DocDate":"07-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Executive Director's Statement (Executive Director's Statement),  Vol.1","DocType":"Executive Director's Statement","EntityID":"000016351_20140506144119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000016351_20140506144119","DocDate":"03-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Executive Director's Statement (Executive Director's Statement),  Vol.1","DocType":"Executive Director's Statement","EntityID":"000016351_20140506120745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000016351_20140506120745","DocDate":"28-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01111004014520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01111004014520","DocDate":"31-OCT-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of El Salvador","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
