The main objectives of the project will be to put in place the institutional and technical capabilities required for effective environmental monitoring, policy formulation and coordination; to support a pilot program to combat soil degradation and erosion; and to help prevent further destruction of the fragile resource base in the coastal zone, in which issues of global environmental concerns are partly involved.  The project includes three components:  (a) development of an environmental resource management system; (b) land resources management; and (c) coastal wetlands management.
