For this purpose, the project would help replace some obsolete plants, revamp others and increase production capacity. It includes construction of an ammonia plant with 900 metric tons capacity per day, and two nitric acid plants, each with 360 metric tons capacity per day; revamping of urea and ammonium nitrate facilities; and a study of fertilizer use in Portugal. The Government is determined to develop agriculture to its full potential and is taking important measures (improved agricultural credit, extension and training) to that end. However, the very low fertilizer use should be improved in order to render the other development measures fully effective. The proposed project would help determine ways and means of promoting efficient fertilizer use by farmers and would ensure that the future fertilizer requirements are met at competitive cost, without dependence on imports and free of international market fluctuations. The productivity gains which are expected to result from better fertilizer availability and use would help to increase total agricultural output, and reduce agricultural imports."},"country_namecode":"Portuguese Republic!$!PT","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"58,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PT","sectorcode":"IC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","code":"IC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925025837","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925025837","DocDate":"30-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3ef_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3ef_1_0","DocDate":"04-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3ed_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3ed_1_0","DocDate":"04-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902320515","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902320515","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912412469","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912412469","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"}],"countryname":"Portuguese Republic"}},"facets":{}}
