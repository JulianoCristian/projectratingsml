St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis are the first of the OECS countries to join the program. There are three main project components. The first increases equitable access and equity in secondary education, particularly in poor rural communities, by constructing a new secondary school in St. Kitts and providing equipment, furniture, and materials; and expanding the school meals program in secondary schools. The second component comprises 4 subcomponents, which 1) develop curriculum for Forms i-III and provide instructional guides, textbooks, ad other resource materials; train trainers/educators in select areas, including fellowships, and development of a coordinated teacher appraisal system; 2) establish learning resource centers, and expand and upgrade learning centers, including science and information technology labs; 3) elaborate program to support participation of disadvantaged students, and related teacher development in special education; and, 4) provide school-based improvement projects, and extra-curricular activities. The third component expands the education management information system, including networking of schools and EMIS training."},"country_namecode":"St. Lucia!$!LC","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"LC","sectorcode":"BC,ET,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,65,66,57","mjthemecode":"7,8,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":85},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20090630001532","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20090630001532","DocDate":"30-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20060713110352","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060713110352","DocDate":"01-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20051108132559","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051108132559","DocDate":"01-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202115302","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202115302","DocDate":"26-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2008011016471703","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2008011016471703","DocDate":"26-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2008011016471703","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2008011016471703","DocURL":"26-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202115201","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202115201","DocURL":"26-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202115201","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202115201","DocDate":"26-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20031111091449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20031111091449","DocDate":"15-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02091205205292","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02091205205292","DocDate":"28-MAR-2002"}],"countryname":"St. Lucia"}},"facets":{}}
