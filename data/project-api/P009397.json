Its main objectives are: (a) to expand and strengthen the primary health care and family planning service delivery system; (b) to expand and improve the quality of training for health and family planning field staff; (c) to continue and expand, on a limited basis, selected information, education and motivation activities initiated under the first project; and (d) to improve the program's management, monitoring and evaluation, and research capacity. In order to minimize the risks of delay in project implementation and to strengthen the population control/family planning program, the Government is taking special measures designed to decentralize the program's management and organization, to streamline its administrative, financial and recruitment procedures and to strengthen the effectiveness of the program's field organization and field workers."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Targeted health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Targeted health"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Agreement","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"HT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Targeted health","code":"HT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924173255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924173255","DocDate":"31-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902330641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902330641","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c71_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c71_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
