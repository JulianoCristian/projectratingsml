Of this production, 9.2 billion liters would be used to substitute for 45% of projected 1985 gasoline consumption, and the remainder would be used for chemical feedstocks. The project consists of three components: (a) a production component comprising about 250 alcohol units (distilleries and related agricultural facilities) expected to be approved by the Brazilian Government during 1981-83 and coming on-stream during 1983-85. These units would provide additional production capacity of about 5.6 billion liters, of which 95% is expected to be sugarcane-based and 5% cassava-based. This component would also include units to demonstrate the feasibility of new technology, such as alcohol production from wood; (b) a technology development component to support basic and applied agricultural and industrial research related to production and use of biomass energy; (c) a monitoring and evaluation system to analyze the impact of the Alcohol Program on the agricultural, transport and industrial sectors, rural employment, and the environment, in order to identify any needed corrective measures and facilitate planning."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"PY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","code":"PY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925063327","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925063327","DocDate":"29-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e9767c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9767c_1_0","DocDate":"12-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e9767b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9767b_1_0","DocDate":"12-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97679_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97679_1_0","DocDate":"12-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902373583","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902373583","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912521461","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912521461","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
