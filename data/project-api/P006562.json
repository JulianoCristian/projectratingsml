The project will consist of four primary components: (1) the Municipal Reform component will finance basic reforms to reduce the municipal government's role in providing urban infrastructure and social service delivery, by privatizing or using private concessions; (2) the Institutional Development component consists of technical assistance, training, and equipment purchases for municipalities and for the state regional development authority, as well as modernization and administrative reforms studies; (3) the Urban Infrastructure component will focus on investment projects in urban infrastructure, water, sewage, solid waste, paving and drainage, and complementary, and regional investments; and (4) the urban upgrading component, targeted to areas with average household income below a maximum income ceiling will consist of a package of integrated urban infrastructure investments;  to repair macro and micro-damage, complementary investments, and regional investments; and (4) the urban upgrading component, targeted to areas with average household income below a maximum income threshold level, will consist of a package of integrated urban infrastructure investments."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":13},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BH,TZ,WZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Urban development","Urban development","Urban development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,73,72,71,27","mjthemecode":"2,9,9,9,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":78},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":13},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050401084223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050401084223","DocDate":"30-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229181737","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229181737","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123132208","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123132208","DocURL":"28-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123131806","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123131806","DocURL":"28-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123131605","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123131605","DocURL":"28-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123132107","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123132107","DocURL":"28-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970619110800","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970619110800","DocDate":"28-JAN-1997"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
