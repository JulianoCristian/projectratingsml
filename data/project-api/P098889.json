The restructuring consists of the following modifications: (1) discontinuation of non-performing project activities and inclusion of the new activity that responds to new constraints and opportunities for the cotton sector, which were not present during project design; (2) modification of the project development objective; (3) modification of the outcome indicators and adjustment of the outcome targets; and (4) broadening the regional coverage of the project. The revised project structure will facilitate increased competition in the domestic cotton market and enhance the impact of the action plan to reform agriculture, promulgated by the Government of Tajikistan (GoT) decree on July 2, 2009; which aims to free farmers from their dependence on cotton ginneries through a combination of debt write-off and improved access to credit from commercial banks. The changes will improve the effectiveness of project implementation, meet the immediate agriculture sector financing needs, increase farmer knowledge and autonomy over finance and improve overall agriculture sector performance in Tajikistan."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":52},"sector2":{"Name":"Central
