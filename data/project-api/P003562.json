The project will include the following components: (a) the construction of Ziaolangdi rockfill dam (with a sloping core), 154 meters, with associated intake and outlet structures; (b) construction of a power station and associated six tunnels with turbine and generators with an installed capacity of 1,800 MW (6 x 300 MW) and associated switchyards, and transformers; (c) an environmental management component to monitor, manage and offset any negative impacts of the project; (d) training and technical assistance for Yellow River Water and Hydropower Corporation in contract management, project scheduling, cost control, claims management, financial management, management information systems, organizational support, corporate planning and personnel management; and (e) an institutional support component for the Ministry of Water Resources and the Yellow River Conservation Commission. The resettlement of 171,000 people displaced by the project and the development of their livelihoods is being undertaken through a separate project being processed simultaneously."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
