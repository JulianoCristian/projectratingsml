The two main components of the project consist of: 1) participatory planning and investment, which will include those investment activities based on, and supported by, the development of participatory planning systems. Beginning at the village level, with the creation of the Village Development Committees (VDC), different local government levels will progressively be reached, in a process defined as the Local Development Process (LDP). Through this process the project will finance the costs of participatory rural appraisals, selected on the basis set by the implementation guide criteria. Furthermore, the LDP will assist VDCs in determining the community's development priorities; and, 2) institutional strengthening and project management, i.e., the project will provide resources, both at the provincial and district/commune/village levels, to carry out the establishment of an information systems management; conduct participatory evaluation studies of project performance and impact; review subproject design and construction supervision; and, provide training as needed."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Cambodia!$!KH","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":22},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":17},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"KH","sectorcode":"BH,BC,TA,AI,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Rural development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"41,75,79,78,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,10,10,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":22},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":22},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000020439_20071004113531","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20071004113531","DocDate":"27-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050630085230","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050630085230","DocDate":"14-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201055180","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201055180","DocURL":"15-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201055180","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201055180","DocDate":"15-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99051205330835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99051205330835","DocDate":"30-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703525230","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703525230","DocDate":"30-SEP-1998"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Cambodia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
