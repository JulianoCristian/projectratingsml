The project consists of one component.  It will be fully used to support the Government's contract teacher program. It will contribute to the payment of the salaries of 37,200 primary public school contract teachers recruited during FY07, FY08, FY09 and FY10 during: (a) the period from January 2010 through the date which is four months after the effective date, and (b) part of the remainder of the 2010 and 2011 school year. The indicators for this project will be the reduction in pupil-teacher ratios (PTR) and reduction in the variation of PTR across regions. PTRs are measured by dividing the number of teachers by the number of students within regions and for the nation. The variation of PTR is calculated by a regressing the size of specific schools against the number of teachers in each specific school."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cameroon!$!CM","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"24,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CM","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"65","mjthemecode":"8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000445729_20130626134703","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130626134703","DocDate":"01-SEP-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120719010444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120719010444","DocDate":"28-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011122719060171","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011122719060171","DocDate":"27-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011040312255386","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011040312255386","DocDate":"03-APR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000362596_2011030111332042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000362596_2011030111332042","DocDate":"11-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000333037_20100908000717","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100908000717","DocDate":"18-AUG-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000262044_20100802132020","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100802132020","DocDate":"29-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000262044_20100707142335","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100707142335","DocDate":"17-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000101930_20091005153828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000101930_20091005153828","DocDate":"30-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20090929111356","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090929111356","DocDate":"28-SEP-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cameroon"}},"facets":{}}
