The project will have the following components: 1) drought management, which includes preparedness (drought monitoring), mitigation (drought contingency planning and rapid reaction) and recovery (continued drought relief activities); 2) marketing and infrastructure, which will address the bottlenecks that impede livestock market linkages between the ALs and the rest of the national economy; and 3) economy development, which will be instrumental in assisting line ministries and collaborating agencies to adapt their organization and delivery systems to the specific conditions of the ALs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social
