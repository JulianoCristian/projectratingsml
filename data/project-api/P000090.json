Specifically, the project involves two components; namely a rural development component and an institution building component. The first component includes (a) provision of incremental inputs, improved extension and animal traction for farmers in the Borgou province; (b) applied food-crop and cotton research; (c) environmental protection and (d) infrastructure development programs. This component further entails (e) pilot rehabilitation of 100 ha of bottomlands and construction/rehabilitation of 65 wells and (f) rehabilitation and maintenance of about 300 km of feeder roads. The institutional component aims at (a) strengthening the financial management and procedures of certain agencies; (b) preparing a medium-term development program; and (c) establishing cotton Stabilization Fund and a central audit as well as an accounting and financial training unit for the cotton subsector as a whole. Lastly, it provides for studies and consultant services to help prepare a medium-term restructuring and development program for the rural sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"21,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007024947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007024947","DocDate":"15-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120342879","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120342879","DocURL":"25-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120342879","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120342879","DocDate":"25-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120343080","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120343080","DocDate":"25-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120343080","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120343080","DocURL":"25-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08248_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08248_1_0","DocDate":"16-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926040501","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926040501","DocDate":"12-JAN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100429025644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100429025644","DocDate":"12-JAN-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin"}},"facets":{}}
