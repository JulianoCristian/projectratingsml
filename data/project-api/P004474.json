It provides for the construction of diversion dams, irrigation and drainage facilities and related roads and offices, provision of consulting services to assist NIA in design engineering and training; procurement of vehicles and equipment; and strengthening of the malaria control unit in Palawan. Approximately 11,600 farm families and 900 landless laborers' families, or a total of 74,000 people, would benefit directly from increased production and consequent employment. The project would also create a demand for some 12,500 full-time farm-laborer jobs. A total of about 12,000 people would be reached under the malaria control component. No implementation problems are anticipated, as NIA is a well managed, competent organization, and has had considerable experience in projects of similar scope."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"71,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924225054","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924225054","DocDate":"30-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9611b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9611b_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902343122","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902343122","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912484386","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912484386","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
