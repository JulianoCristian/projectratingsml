The operation will continue to focus on three broad components of the poverty reduction agenda organized under: (1) the promotion of growth, income and employment; (2) improvements in the delivery of services for human development; and (3) the strengthening of governance and public sector management. While the PRSC-3 support would translate primarily into funding for the implementation of the GPRS, particular attention is given to policy dialogue and to monitoring resource allocation and outcomes. The proposed PRSC-3 would also pay attention to welfare and poverty indicators that allow an assessment of whether poverty reduction objectives (including income and non-income dimensions of poverty) are being achieved."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":16},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"125,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"YZ,LT,EP,JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Human development","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"45,65,27,25,67","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,2,2,8,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":10},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070531135706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070531135706","DocDate":"17-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2005111113035544","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005111113035544","DocURL":"29-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000021321_2005111113035544","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005111113035544","DocDate":"29-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20050804100945","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050804100945","DocDate":"25-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050714093125","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050714093125","DocDate":"07-JUL-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
