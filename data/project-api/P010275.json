The project will add about 120 megawatts (MW) of generating capacity through rehabilitation and about 80 MW through conversion of combustion turbines to combined cycle operation. It will also promote more efficient use of energy by reducing the consumption of fuel per kilowatt hour (kWh) of power generated. In addition the project will continue the institution building efforts initiated under the Bank Group's earlier lending operations by strengthening the Water and Power Development Authority's (WAPDA) capability in the operation and maintenance of thermal power stations and spare parts management."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"70,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019193904","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019193904","DocDate":"06-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091922","DocDate":"31-MAR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926032430","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926032430","DocDate":"07-MAR-1987"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
