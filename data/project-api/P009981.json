First, the project will finance investment projects which are important for the modernization and restructuring of the industry. Second, the project will help establish and finance a pilot bulk cement transport system to transport bulk cement to the greater Bombay area. Successful implementation of this pilot scheme will pave the way to introduce bulk cement transport systems in India. Third, the project will help establish and finance demand-driven training systems and programs to support human resource development compatible with the significant technological transformation of the industry. Fourth, the project will assist DCCI in studying policy and strategic options for mini cement sector, coal washing, use of lignite, pollution control and environmental protection for the cement industry, and further development of bulk cement transport and applications."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"TW,YW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"49,44","mjthemecode":"4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":96},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040611480751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040611480751","DocDate":"13-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042912314552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042912314552","DocDate":"13-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928211228","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928211228","DocDate":"18-APR-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
