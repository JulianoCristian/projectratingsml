The project will include: (a) technology transfer, involving both farm-oriented extension and home-centered assistance (family kitchen gardens, and water treatment, improved diets and cooking methods, awareness of education and health services); (b) complementary credit for working capital which is consistent with technology transfer initiatives; (c) land titling; (d) a rural communication system to improve the dissemination of information related to small farmer production and social services; and (e) institutional strengthening.  The main benefits will be : (a) increased on-farm productivity and family incomes and improved welfare; (b) improved and more cost-effective agricultural services; (c) improvement in the credit-worthiness of subsistence farmers; and (d) better targeting of public services, including improvement of services to women farmers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"95,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,75,25","mjthemecode":"2,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":86},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00022306442580","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00022306442580","DocDate":"29-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002042006","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002042006","DocDate":"16-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002041844","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002041844","DocDate":"14-APR-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile"}},"facets":{}}
