The project consists of four components. The first, capacity building and policy development, will support the National HIV/Aids Council as well as addressing a national strategy and action plan; project coordination and administration; and advocacy, training, monitoring, evaluation, and technical support activities. The second, multi-sectoral responses to prevention and care, will improve the capacity of non-health sector line departments to respond to the epidemic. The third component, health sector responses to Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDs management, will provide resources to the sector for management manuals and other activities, including enhancement of the blood supply system and acquiring access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy as well as general prevention and care. The fourth component, community and civil service initiatives, will provide grant resources to eligible applicants."},"country_namecode":"Republic of The Gambia!$!GM","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":73},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":18},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GM","sectorcode":"BH,BC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"88,26,57","mjthemecode":"7,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":73},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":18},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070724104947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070724104947","DocDate":"28-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201175796","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201175796","DocURL":"02-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201175796","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201175796","DocDate":"02-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00102505335512","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00102505335512","DocDate":"18-OCT-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of The Gambia"}},"facets":{}}
