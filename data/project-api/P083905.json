The objectives of this series of loans are two: first, to promote reforms addressing fiscal rigidities necessary to attain the substantial fiscal adjustment underlying sustainable macroeconomic stability; and second, to improve the provision of public services and  establish the institutional basis for higher efficiency and accountability in public expenditure. The specific objectives of the FIAL program are to: (i) increase tax revenue and reduce distortions in the tax system; (ii) modernize the tax administration; (iii) promote the development of a sound fiscal responsibility legal framework; (iv) reduce losses and generate revenues through improved asset management; (v) prevent massive losses to the State from judicial claims; (vi) improve budget management with modem tools and legal reforms; (vii) develop incentives for efficiency gains in subnational entities; (viii) strengthen the public sector procurement system; (ix) improve performance through management contracts for agencies; and (x) support a coherent and comprehensive reform implementation process. This Second Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Structural Adjustment Loan Project focuses on the following elements: (i) issuance of all legislation to regulate the application of the tax reform law; (ii) further improvements in tax administration, including specific audit targets and the implementation of integrated tax-customs audits; (iii) approval of an official budget reform strategy; (iv) Congressional approval of an improved 2004 Annual Budget Law; (v) presentation to popular vote of the Constitutional referendum; (vi) issuance of a new policy for legal defense of the state; (vii) presentation to Congress of reforms to the public "},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"EZ,BG,BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Public sector governance","Rule of law","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"28,33,25,21,27","mjthemecode":"2,1,2,3,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":70},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20080623035431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080623035431","DocDate":"22-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20041103090400","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041103090400","DocDate":"28-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2005121209234691","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2005121209234691","DocURL":"24-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2005121209234691","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2005121209234691","DocDate":"24-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20031030100909","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20031030100909","DocDate":"23-OCT-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
