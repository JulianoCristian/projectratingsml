The line of credit will be reimbursed by the banks periodically according to a schedule matching the schedules set for subloans. The interest rate charged to banks will reflect the cost of funds and that charge to beneficiaries will be within the maximum ceiling presently set at 12.5 percent p.a. These interest rates will be variable and will be reviewed periodically to ensure they reflect inflation and macroeconomic conditions. The Enterprise Development Fund institution will receive the funds as a grant, and private beneficiaries will share in the cost of services provided."},"country_namecode":"Union of the Comoros!$!KM","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"5,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KM","sectorcode":"BC,FE,BG,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Rule of law","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"45,34,33,44,41","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,4,3,3,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030701143242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030701143242","DocDate":"28-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121231399","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121231399","DocURL":"27-OCT-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121231399","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121231399","DocDate":"27-OCT-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121231600","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121231600","DocDate":"27-OCT-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121231600","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121231600","DocURL":"27-OCT-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b3dd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b3dd_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006002144","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006002144","DocDate":"01-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006001832","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006001832","DocDate":"01-JUN-1994"}],"countryname":"Union of the Comoros","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
