It provides for credit to cooperative and state farms, construction of feeder roads, a village water supply scheme and improved irrigation system; a water management study; an agricultural policies study; and technical assistance and training. The principal beneficiaries would be 7,000 cooperative farm families (36,000 persons) whose present income is well below the poverty level; the project would help to increase their income by about 63 percent in six years. The project faces no special risks although delays in recruiting the expatriate experts to assist in implementing the project would result in a postponement of the benefits to a period later than envisaged. Institution building objectives would be achieved through technical assistance comprising management support to the implementing agency and training of its staff."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924203000","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924203000","DocDate":"18-JUL-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190229141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190229141","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b8b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b8b_1_0","DocDate":"14-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912225575","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912225575","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
