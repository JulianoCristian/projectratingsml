The project consists of three components. First, the local institutions strengthening component will support the Local Administration and Line Ministries at the governorate, district, and village levels in assisting local communities to identify, plan, operate, and maintain rural infrastructure through training and technical assistance. Second, the village infrastructure component will support Village Priority Development Plans identified, prepared, and co-financed through the SHROUK participatory process. It will provide grant financing to support community-based social and economic infrastructure sub-projects such as village water supply systems, rural roads, health centers, women's clubs, etc. Third, the rural finance component will promote increased economic activities and open access to credit for women and the rural poor in Sohag. It will also support on-farm technology improvement and rural-based investment. The component will also finance a special wholesale credit window for nongovernmental organizations and provide institutional support to the Local Development Fund."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":14},"sector5":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":11},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"FE,JB,WC,BZ,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Rural development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"51,78,75,57,76","mjthemecode":"10,7,10,10,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":42},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":14},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":14},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090308235241","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090308235241","DocDate":"31-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052116055740","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052116055740","DocDate":"04-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042812051109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042812051109","DocDate":"04-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030409305507","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030409305507","DocDate":"04-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042812032308","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042812032308","DocDate":"04-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000178830_98111703554110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703554110","DocDate":"31-JUL-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184207","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184207","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
