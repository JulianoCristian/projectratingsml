PL3 continues to support the Government's successful policy response to the economic slowdown. Key reform initiatives included the anti-crisis stability and development plan; the reduction in the tax wedge; the phasing out of early retirement pensions; and the amendments of the law on freedom of business operations, the public finance act and the 2009 state budget. Following the second policy loan, PL3 will continue to support Government measures to mitigate the impact of the global crisis on households, workers and businesses. With the recovery gaining speed, it also supports Government efforts to unwind the extraordinary anti-crisis policies and step up reforms to reinforce Poland's growth prospects."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":34},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"1,331,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Inspection Panel Notice of Registration,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"YZ,BC,JA,EZ,BE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,27,51,66,67","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,8,6,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Education","Percent":22},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":11},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20130912095644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130912095644","DocDate":"25-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Inspection Panel Notice of Registration (IPNR),  Vol.1","DocType":"IPNR","EntityID":"000334955_20100728041436","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100728041436","DocDate":"23-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2010110813041255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010110813041255","DocDate":"23-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100527041823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100527041823","DocDate":"11-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100224094404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100224094404","DocDate":"23-FEB-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
