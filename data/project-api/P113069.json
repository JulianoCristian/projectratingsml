The project has three components. The first component, on promoting government efficiency and effectiveness, will contribute to the cross-cutting theme on governance in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). Moreover, improved budgetary processes, better fiduciary systems, expanded e-governance, and stronger public administration will strengthen institutional capacity and achieve better quality of services for citizens. The second component, on private sector development, aligns directly with the economic diversification and financial inclusion pillar of the CPS, and the actions taken to enhance employability and improve the policy environment for the private sector will contribute to the corresponding CPS goals. The third DPC component on improving sustainable access to infrastructure will support spatial planning and public services. Institutional strengthening in the roads and urban sectors will ultimately help provide better access and quality, while measures to promote environmental sustainability and disaster risk management will contribute to better environmental stewardship and improved sustainability of infrastructure."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Bhutan!$!BT","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":36},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":7},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":7},"totalcommamt":"24,750,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BT","sectorcode":"BH,BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Urban development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"25,27,74,29","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,9,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":57},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":36},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011042313332746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011042313332746","DocDate":"23-APR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"090224b081af60c5_3_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081af60c5_3_0","DocDate":"21-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000370910_20101102093353","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000370910_20101102093353","DocDate":"23-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100512114107","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100512114107","DocDate":"06-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100201113846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100201113846","DocDate":"18-DEC-2009"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Bhutan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
