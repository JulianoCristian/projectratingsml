To achieve this, there are three project components. Component 1 targets the prevention, control and total eradication of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza through: (1) strategy development and epidemiological studies and surveillance programs to inform the improvement of disease control measures; (2) strengthening the detection capacity of reference and regional diagnostic laboratories to follow-up reported Avian influenza cases; (3) support to activities related to implementing the containment plan for avian influenza outbreaks; and (4) and restructuring the poultry sector. Component 2 targets reducing the impact of a pandemic influenza virus through: (1) year-round surveillance; (2) effective and accurate methods of diagnosis; (3) social distance interventions; and (4) strengthened medical services. The project helps the Ministry of Health (MOH) to build its institutional capacity to implement the recently prepared national pandemic influenza action plan in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA). Component 3 supports information and communication activities to increase the attention and commitment of government, the private sector, and civil society organizations and to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general population about the risk and potential impact of the pandemic. It will also support the National Zoonotic Disease in its roles of triggering emergency responses by the MARA and MOH, monitoring the actions taken by them, coordinating public statements to the
