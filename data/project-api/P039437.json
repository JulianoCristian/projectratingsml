The main components will: 1) promote social capital formation, by supporting planning for local development, at the community, parochial, and canton levels, as part of a participatory development planning process. Rural communities will identify priority subprojects, and, community representatives will participate in the planning process at the parochial level; likewise, cantons will prepare their development plans, to include linkages to parochial subprojects; 2) train local stakeholders through organized nongovernmental organizations, who will survey technical skills, and prepare a capacity gap analysis, and implement training programs. Formation of local networks of technicians will be promoted, to in turn expand their technical skills, while technical assistance will build local governments' management, and administrative capacities; 3) establish a demand-driven grant fund, to finance infrastructure, productive capacity of socio-territorial organizations, and environmental investment subprojects. Technical screening of this work will be undertaken by technical personnel at the regional level; and, 4) finance consulting services, and equipment to implement the managerial, financial, and technical coordination, through the Project Coordination Unit."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":6},"sector5":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"25,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"TZ,WZ,JB,AZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"73,57,83,77,51","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,10,11,7,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":8},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":6},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080828235635","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080828235635","DocDate":"25-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200464334","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200464334","DocURL":"03-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200464938","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200464938","DocURL":"03-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052114202723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052114202723","DocDate":"03-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052114245098","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052114245098","DocDate":"03-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01062004021745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01062004021745","DocDate":"06-JUN-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
