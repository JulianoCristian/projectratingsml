Like DPEP I, this project will build national, state, district, and sub-district level managerial and professional capacity for the sustainable development of primary education in the project states and will support district-based activities aimed at improving access to education, reducing dropout and increasing learning achievement, with special emphasis on interventions that will target female and scheduled caste/scheduled tribe students, as well as children with mild to moderate disabilities. The project will consist of the following four components: 1) building and strengthening state institutional capacity in project states; 2) improving the quality of, reducing dropout from, and expanding access to primary education by strengthening the capacity of district and sub-district institutions to plan and manage program delivery; developing community participation and awareness; improving teacher in-service training, learning materials and teaching aids; and constructing new classrooms and improving existing school facilities in participating districts; 3) developing a distance education program; and 4) continuing the national management structure support for DPEP."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Primary
