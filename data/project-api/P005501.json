The project will: 1) target the poorest population in the country; 2) aim to have an impact on both the supply of and demand for education; and 3) affect institutions both upstream (Koranic preschools) and downstream (literacy education for adults) of the formal education system. The project will be concentrated in specific communities located in thirteen selected provinces. It will consist of the following five components: 1) increase in the access to and retention rates of basic schooling; 2) reduction of the gap between the school participation rates of boys and girls; 3) improvement of education quality; 4) improvement of the performance of government literacy programs; and 5) provision of technical support to the Ministry of National Education to operationalize and implement its Sector Action Plan, which aims to reallocate resources to priority programs and improve budgetary efficiency."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"54,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"BC,EL,ET,JB,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,78,65,57,59","mjthemecode":"7,7,8,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":60},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":22},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040629135205","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040629135205","DocDate":"25-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060330180502","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060330180502","DocDate":"24-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123111940","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123111940","DocURL":"27-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019161216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019161216","DocDate":"09-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20090909035952","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090909035952","DocDate":"09-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052814215628","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052814215628","DocDate":"20-DEC-1993"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
