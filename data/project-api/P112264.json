This will be achieved by: (i) strengthening the conditions for competition in crucial markets, in particular the telecommunications sector and public procurement; (ii) streamlining business regulations that will lower trade and other transactions costs and facilitate the adoption of new technologies; (iii) improving the regulatory framework to foster financial sector access, stability and market transparency; and (iv) promoting public-private partnerships in infrastructure to expand core infrastructure services essential to the productivity of Mexican firms. The four pillars are mutually reinforcing. Improving telecommunication services is critical to support mobile banking operations so as to expand access to finance and to build the e-platform necessary to modernize business regulations and public procurement. The streamlining of business regulations together with the expansion of infrastructure through greater private participation will help reduce logistics costs of Mexican firms increasing their competitiveness and facilitating their access to new export markets. Modern business regulations and greater access to finance will increase the incentives of becoming formal, the former by reducing the costs of formality and the latter by making it easier to exploit its benefits."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":33},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":21},"sector4":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"SME Finance","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":10},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":37},"theme3":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":10},"totalcommamt":"751,880,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"SME Finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Summary of Discussion,Program Document,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"FH,CT,BC,FZ,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"28,40,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"SME Finance","code":"FH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":33},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":21},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":21},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":13},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20120803010411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120803010411","DocDate":"30-JUL-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000362596_2011122311514474","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000362596_2011122311514474","DocDate":"13-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011081316150444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011081316150444","DocDate":"13-AUG-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022516145387","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022516145387","DocDate":"25-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000333038_20110119235906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20110119235906","DocDate":"18-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000020439_20101223100409","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20101223100409","DocDate":"15-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000356161_20110407045012","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110407045012","DocDate":"15-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20101105150743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20101105150743","DocDate":"15-OCT-2010"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
