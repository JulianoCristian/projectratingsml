The components include: 1) creation of additional school spaces under the basic general education for grades 7-9 (EGB3), expanding the number of hours, to develop and apply a new pedagogical model of the \"Jornada completa\" (full time schedule), to the poorest urban districts. Classrooms will be rehabilitated in about one hundred and sixty five EGB3 schools, reducing the persistent overcrowding in many urban school facilities. Civil works will be performed in accordance to the master plan, designed following the Government's standards, and regulations; 2) provision of pedagogic equipment, and services, such as school libraries, science and language laboratories, and learning material, for innovative implementation of the full time schedule; 3) local and international seminars, and workshops which would provide support for autonomous school management, and projects in selected EGB3 schools; and 4) complementary financing of the current Project Unit, already implementing other operations, to finance staff for civil works, accounting, procurement, and, technical assistance and training in management, and information technology."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Segundo proyecto de educaci\u00f3n secundaria \u2013 Provincia de Buenos Aires</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"56,990,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"BC,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Human development"],"themecode":"65,71","mjthemecode":"9,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20090602045028","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20090602045028","DocDate":"14-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201471335","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201471335","DocURL":"15-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201471234","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201471234","DocDate":"15-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201470233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201470233","DocDate":"15-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201470233","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201470233","DocURL":"15-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201471234","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201471234","DocURL":"15-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2008040211375336","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2008040211375336","DocURL":"15-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201471335","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201471335","DocDate":"15-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2008040211375336","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2008040211375336","DocDate":"15-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00111705322763","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00111705322763","DocDate":"07-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00072605400471","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00072605400471","DocDate":"17-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002024113","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002024113","DocDate":"25-AUG-1992"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
