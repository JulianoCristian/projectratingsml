The project would accomplish this with:  (a) an afforestation program; (b) a forest management program; and (c) assistance for management, training, policy analysis, research and studies.  The project's afforestation component would stabilize soil conditions and enhance soil moisture and nutrient content, benefitting agricultural productivity.  The forest management component would improve the management of existing plantations and help establish new plantations, increasing the availability of industrial timber. The support for management, training, policy initiatives, research and studies would greatly strengthen the structural base of the sector."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":84},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"71,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"AB,BH,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"86,82","mjthemecode":"11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":84},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040824172523","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040824172523","DocDate":"30-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165319","DocDate":"30-SEP-1986"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
