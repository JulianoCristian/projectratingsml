The terms of the loan will be those normally applied to Bank loans to development finance companies, including the standard commitment fee. Unlike the fifth Loan Agreement with the Bank, there should be no specific limit on the use of Bank funds for public sector projects eligible for BNDE's financing under its policy statement. The proceeds of the loan should be used to finance direct imports, or the equivalent of 65 percent of off-the-shelf procurements, representing the import element of these costs. The free limit should remain $500,000, with an aggregate free limit corresponding to $6 million. The maximum amount of Bank funds to be used for a single investment project should be fixed at $3.5 million. The definition of BNDE's borrowing basis should be amended in order to exclude the part of provisions needed to cover realistically estimated loss possibilities, and BNDE should seek annually its auditor's opinion regarding the adequacy of this estimate. Under the proposed definition, BNDE's limit on term debt should be set at 6 times its borrowing basis. BNDE does not place the foreign exchange risk upon its borrowers. This book assesses the performance of family planning programs in developing countries, looking at their contributions and their costs. Attempts at identifying the attributes and approaches critical to effective programs are examined. This book draws on research to provide not a primer on running programs but a broad overview of what makes programs succeed. Focusing on family planning programs and their operation, it notes but does not elaborate on the contributions that other social development interventions make to an ongoing reproductive revolution, which is gradually transforming demographic prospects and individual lives.
