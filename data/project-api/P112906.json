The grant will help finance the costs associated with the Government's effort to monitor, control, and reduce the number of fatalities and the risk of contraction of the A/HlNl Human Influenza, which has resulted in 2,152 confirmed cases of the A/HlN1 Human Influenza registered as of October 30, 2009, and eighteen deaths reported. Given that epidemiologists expect a second wave of the influenza to hit Central America beginning in the Fall, the Government of Nicaragua (GoN) has requested Bank support in strengthening its capacity to manage the spread of the virus (and other influenza viruses as well). The project will assist Nicaragua in improving its epidemiological surveillance system and providing medicines to treat infected individuals, with special attention to high risk groups."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Nicaragua!$!NI","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Public administration- Health","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Public administration- Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Aide Memoire,Aide Memoire,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Procurement Plan","countrycode":"NI","sectorcode":"BQ,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"64,67","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Public administration- Health","code":"BQ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20121231013121","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20121231013121","DocDate":"26-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012082212224486","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012082212224486","DocDate":"22-AUG-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000020439_20121212101601","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20121212101601","DocDate":"06-APR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012033112161027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012033112161027","DocDate":"31-MAR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011090717090568","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011090717090568","DocDate":"07-SEP-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Aide Memoire (AM),  Vol.1","DocType":"AM","EntityID":"090224b08171df71_2_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08171df71_2_0","DocDate":"09-AUG-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Aide Memoire (AM),  Vol.1","DocType":"AM","EntityID":"000333037_20150217122855","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20150217122855","DocDate":"23-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022017453307","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022017453307","DocDate":"20-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000350881_20100127085220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20100127085220","DocDate":"24-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000262044_20091113084607","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20091113084607","DocDate":"12-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20090928104921","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090928104921","DocDate":"23-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000334955_20100520043106","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100520043106","DocDate":"08-APR-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Nicaragua","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
