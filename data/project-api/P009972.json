The project has three main components. The first component, highway upgrading, finances civil works for widening and strengthening the national highway from two lanes to a four-six lane divided carriageway with service roads. This component also supports environmental management including tree planting; project supervision; land acquisition; resettlement and utility relocation; and project management costs. The second component supports a program of maintenance works to introduce alternative contracting methods and to strengthen maintenance management practices. It also finances a program of minor improvements specifically targeted at supporting improved methods for traffic delays and accidents. The third component funds consultancy services to develop and implement an institutional strengthening program, for a road information system, for two pilot corridor management units, and to prepare minor improvement proposals as well as funding a road safety policy study and training and staff development programs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and
