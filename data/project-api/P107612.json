The changes include: (1) changing the implementation agency to reflect structural changes in the Government, specifically subordination of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MENR); (2) designate the Ministry of environment and natural resources as the recipient of capacity building efforts under component three; and (3) eliminate part
