The project consists of nine components. 1) It will establish an overall Program Steering Committee to approve annual work programs and budgets and receive reports on implementation. 2) This component will establish a Training Fund, which will test the demand for, and the effectiveness and efficiency of, both pre-employment training as well as employer-based training. 3) This component will develop managerial capacity to coordinate the operation and financing of the TEVET system, and provide support to trainers. 4) This component will support curriculum development by the training institutions. 5) This component will finance public and private training institutions in developing and implementing approaches to training services aimed at enhancing the dynamism and economic viability of the informal sector. 6) This component will assist each level of institution in developing decentralized, human resources development plans as a part of a business plan. 7) An information system will be set up. 8) This component will support rehabilitation of facilities and equipment. 9) The impact of HIV/AIDS on supply and demand will be studied."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":79},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"JA,BC,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"88,51,25,59,66","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,7,2,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":79},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000386194_20110624023127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110624023127","DocDate":"15-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090805012206","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090805012206","DocDate":"29-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000012009_20050301124642","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050301124642","DocDate":"22-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201220358","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201220358","DocURL":"17-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060704013442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060704013442","DocDate":"23-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00121906035356","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121906035356","DocDate":"30-MAR-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
