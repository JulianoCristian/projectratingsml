The area has a Mediterranean climate, which is favorable for early production of fruit and vegetables, has potential for on-farm irrigation resources and continues to have traditional trade with neighboring countries. This area was impoverished by the war but has the potential to respond readily to a revitalization program. The project will 1) encourage farmers to adopt more productive and profitable production systems and increase the marketability of their surplus production; 2) create a dynamic commercial agriculture by strengthening linkages among farmers and markets through the promotion of private sector investment, and credit for farming, agro-processing and trading; 3) facilitate the export of agriculture products, through information and technical assistance; and 4) support measures and investments to strengthen the physical and institutional infrastructure of rural communities. The project components are: a) market integration; b) private agribusiness support; c) commercial farmers development; and d) project management. The increased production and productivity resulting from the project will increase farming and other rural incomes, and reduce unemployment and poverty."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":29},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"BA","sectorcode":"AB,AH,YA,AI,YB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Trade and integration","Rural development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,75,76,45,77","mjthemecode":"10,5,10,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":29},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":17},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20101215040039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101215040039","DocDate":"20-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20091224002312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091224002312","DocDate":"23-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01072704145368","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072704145368","DocDate":"28-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03031304013164","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03031304013164","DocDate":"27-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02092404214545","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02092404214545","DocDate":"12-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02092704174827","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02092704174827","DocDate":"31-OCT-2002"}],"countryname":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}},"facets":{}}
