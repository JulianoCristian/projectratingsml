The project will be implemented over a five-and-one-half year period. It is expected to reach some 38,000 farm families (about 50% of the Province's total), and to generate an incremental production of 5,700 t of cotton, 5,200 t of maize, 4,000 t of groundnuts, 3,300 t of cowpeas, 400 t of paddy, and 200 t of tobacco. The project's principal quantifiable benefit would derive from the incremental production of cotton, food crops and livestock products. Unquantifiable benefits include better financial management of Government institutions, enhancement of their capability to plan and implement development activities, and the establishment of a firm basis for adaptive food crop and cotton research, and for seed production."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925143504","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925143504","DocDate":"21-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000333038_20090219034138","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090219034138","DocDate":"21-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0588a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0588a_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190240562","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190240562","DocDate":"30-NOV-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912590665","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912590665","DocDate":"30-NOV-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin"}},"facets":{}}
