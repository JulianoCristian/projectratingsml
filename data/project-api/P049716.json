There are four main components. The first consolidates and deepens the budgetary reforms undertaken since 1996, promoting fiscal decentralization by shifting responsibilities for expenditures and revenues management to local governments and communities; and assists local governments in implementing a bottom-up performance budgeting approach and promoting decentralized resource mobilization. This component finances technical support and carries out implementation studies, staff training and workshops on budget and financial management, micro computers and server systems, and critical operating costs. The second component revises the institutional framework, strengthens the ability of strategic and financial units, establishes decentralized delivery and management systems; and improves leadership and management capacity of elected officials and administrative staff by providing training in planning and budgeting, project identification and preparation, and program monitoring and evaluation. The third component improves communication with beneficiaries with a public information program. The fourth component introduces a performance incentive system to improve service delivery."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"19,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Rule of law","Urban development"],"themecode":"73,33,26,25","mjthemecode":"2,2,3,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":80},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20051201142409","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20051201142409","DocDate":"29-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99122006050324","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99122006050324","DocDate":"22-NOV-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
