The Project would expand its activities in the field of technology transfer to achieve more tangible results and increase its impact on the ground. No change is proposed to the Project development objective or implementation modalities. The Project results framework has been revised to reflect the increased development benefits arising from the Additional Financing. The objective of the Project is to establish an institutional framework conducive to efficient agricultural service delivery to producers through the provision of support to core public service decentralization, promotion of private sector participation and empowerment of producer organizations. The Project comprises four components: (A) public service reform and reorganization of the Ministry of Rural Development; (B) improvement of efficiency, relevance and sustainability of the national agricultural research system; (C) improvement of efficiency, relevance and sustainability of the national agricultural extension system; and (D) empowerment of producers and promotion of producer organizations."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
