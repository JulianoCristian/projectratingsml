The cost overrun mainly occurred due to: (1) an increase during the last few years in the price of construction materials, in particular steel and cement, and fuel; and (2) a greater than anticipated volume of rehabilitation work for one component of the project. The additional financing will be required to fund all the originally planned activities in full, specifically the rehabilitation and enlargement of the Samur-Apsheron Canal (SAC) main supply system from km 27 to 50. It will thus mainly be used to carry out the last civil works contract, but there will also be small allocations to finance consultants. The original project development objectives and expected outcomes will remain unchanged."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Azerbaijan!$!AZ","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":88},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"42,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Paper,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"AZ","sectorcode":"BC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,85,74","mjthemecode":"9,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":88},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000011823_20080516123439","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000011823_20080516123439","DocDate":"27-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"006822197_2006102410423497","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006822197_2006102410423497","DocDate":"02-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"006822197_2006102410423497","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006822197_2006102410423497","DocURL":"02-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000160016_20060210101107","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060210101107","DocDate":"01-FEB-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"005081725_2006102410441625","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005081725_2006102410441625","DocURL":"24-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00061705502564","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00061705502564","DocDate":"26-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0005170539283","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0005170539283","DocDate":"31-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99070105315745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99070105315745","DocDate":"02-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062516041794","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062516041794","DocDate":"18-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062516024666","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062516024666","DocDate":"23-FEB-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Azerbaijan"}},"facets":{}}
