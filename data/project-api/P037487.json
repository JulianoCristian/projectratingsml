Credit would be provided for the development of improved pastures, fencing, water supplies, machinery for fodder production, livestock buildings, and the purchase of cattle. In the dry land zone of the southwest, where the project would be mainly located, the most important element would be the replacement of natural pastures of low productivity through the exploitation of subterranean clover and forage crops offering a substantialy higher level of output. Farms in this area would produce mainly feeder cattle and fat stock for slaughter. In the northern area, where conditions are ideal for their product, improved strains of the more productive temperate zone species of permanent pasture would be introduced. Production in this area would be mainly of milk, with weaner calves as a significant by-product. In both areas, cattle would be vaccinated against prevalent diseases."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Spain!$!ES","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ES","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912204445","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912204445","DocDate":"23-AUG-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903161838","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903161838","DocDate":"31-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67eb4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67eb4_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903193966","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903193966","DocDate":"01-JUL-1969"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Spain"}},"facets":{}}
