It would include road and port rehabilitation, irrigation construction, provision and improvement of water supply facilities, schistosomiasis control and consulting services for a feasibility study of development in Northern Samar. The project would: (a) reduce transport costs for farmers and improve road access to markets and health and education facilities for some 40,500 rural families; (b) improve port facilities for travel, import of food and construction materials, and export of agricultural products; (c) provide irrigation facilities which would benefit some 1,000 farm families and 500 landless laborers' families through increased production and employment; (d) provide safe water for about 118,000 rural families, resulting in a reduction in waterborne disease, and (e) provide chemotherapy for about 41,000 people suffering from schistosomiasis and lay the groundwork for a wider control program. No unusual implementation problems are expected since most of the works are standard and would be carried out by agencies having considerable experience in similar works."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"27,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e958be_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958be_1_0","DocDate":"04-DEC-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902335447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902335447","DocDate":"30-NOV-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912470112","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912470112","DocDate":"30-NOV-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
