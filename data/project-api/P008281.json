The first component improves textbook production and distribution by financing the following: (1) purchasing and distributing core textbooks for general education grades 1-10 to schools over a four-year period; (2) providing equipment and technical assistance to establish a computerized system for consolidating textbook orders; (3) providing technical assistance and training in curriculum design and preparation of publishers guidelines; (4) providing technical assistance and training for bid administrators, bid evaluators, authors, and publishers in book procurement; and (5) providing training and information for school directors, teachers, and parents in managing school-based revolving funds and in allocating subsidies to poor students. The second component supports detailed design, piloting, and implementation of the government's strategy for reforming the general education system. Its sub-components will increase efficiency by rationalizing schools and staffing; and improve resource mobilization and school performance by granting schools legal and financial autonomy."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Armenia!$!AM","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":84},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"AM","sectorcode":"BH,BC,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"65,61,57,25","mjthemecode":"2,7,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":84},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20030623135136","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030623135136","DocDate":"11-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170916","DocDate":"28-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172210","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172210","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062316050514","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062316050514","DocDate":"25-JUL-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Armenia"}},"facets":{}}
