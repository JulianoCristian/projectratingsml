The aim is to improve the income of the private farming community and increase its productivity and hence the competitiveness of the sector. The project will address the need: 1) to change delivery mechanisms for the provision of technical services to the private farming community; and 2) for institutional restructuring to meet the needs of a market economy. Increased farmer ownership and accountability of the agricultural knowledge system are also essential elements of project design. The provision of relevant and efficient veterinary services and support for the shift from a grain-based animal production system to a lower cost pasture-based livestock industry are other central objectives. In addition, rationalizing the regulatory framework for the seed industry will be supported. The project will furthermore seek to strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's policy formulation capabilities and the agriculture data base in order to ensure more rational policy decisions in the future. Finally, the project consists of the six following components: 1) extension; 2) research; 3) animal health; 4) pasture and fodder development; 5) seed industry development; and 6) policy analysis support."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Croatia!$!HR","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"17,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HR","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,77,39,40","mjthemecode":"4,4,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":80},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030630131251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030630131251","DocDate":"26-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200225042","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200225042","DocURL":"23-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200225042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200225042","DocDate":"23-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052509455794","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052509455794","DocDate":"23-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008045952","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008045952","DocDate":"23-FEB-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Croatia"}},"facets":{}}
