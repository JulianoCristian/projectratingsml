The CC DPL is envisioned as a series of four annual single tranche loans of similar size anchored to the FY09-FY12 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). CC DPL provides support in three core areas: (i) addressing the need to mitigate Indonesia's greenhouse gas emissions; (ii) enhancing adaptation and resiliency efforts in key sectors; and (iii) strengthening the institutions and cross-cutting policy framework needed for a successful climate change response. Indonesia is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts - sea level rise, changing weather patterns, and increased uncertainty. Potential impacts include: increased threats to food security and agricultural productivity; impacts on productive coastal zones and community livelihoods; consequences for water storage; intensification of water- and vector-borne diseases; and deterioration of coral ecosystems. These changes will put past development gains and poverty alleviation efforts at risk. An approach that increases adaptive ability, builds community resilience and increases preparedness for managing disasters makes economic sense for Indonesia, a kind of insurance. Indonesia may also be able to tap into new forms of global financing to assist in this adaptation response."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":46},"sector2":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":12},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":4},"theme4":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":59},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"JB,WZ,LZ,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,52,78,82,85","mjthemecode":"11,11,10,6,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":46},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":32},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":11},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20130712122059","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130712122059","DocDate":"27-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010092310482817","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010092310482817","DocDate":"23-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100505044713","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100505044713","DocDate":"26-APR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000267706_20100428104750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000267706_20100428104750","DocDate":"22-APR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100406104837","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100406104837","DocDate":"28-MAR-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
