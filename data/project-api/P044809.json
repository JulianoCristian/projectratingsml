The project has three main components. The first component 1) addresses the weaknesses in the legal and regulatory framework that impacts private sector activity adversely and helps obtain expert input to identify and formulate a comprehensive reform policy; 2) strengthens the capacity of the institutions responsible for law reform and legal education in the area of commercial law by providing short-term training and materials, upgrading and introducing courses in the law school, and launching campaigns and disseminating materials to develop public awareness; 3) provides local and international training for lawyers in the Attorney General's office and judges; and 4) develops an automated and on line Legal Information Network (LAWNET), which includes statutes, government regulations, case information/court decisions, and textbook excerpts; and organizes and modernizes the storage and retrieval of related publications. The second component helps the Office of the Registrar of Companies (ORC) improve its administration, management, and regulatory capacities. The third component finances judicial training and faculty development, reorganizes the Judicial Services Commission, introduces model courts, and develops a formal mediation system."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Legal services","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Access to law and justice","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"18,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"BG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Rule of law","Rule of law","Rule of law","Rule of law"],"themecode":"31,33,35,32,34","mjthemecode":"3,3,3,3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Legal services","code":"35"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Access to law and justice","code":"31"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080704000151","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080704000151","DocDate":"01-OCT-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000090341_20040812111242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040812111242","DocDate":"26-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101508","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101508","DocDate":"14-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123571023","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123571023","DocURL":"22-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00061705424561","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00061705424561","DocDate":"12-MAY-2000"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
