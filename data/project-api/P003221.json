It will assist Zambia to transform its highly regulated financial sector, and inefficient maize marketing and milling, fertilizer distribution, and rural transportation systems into more competitive and efficient ones.  The main objectives of this project are to: (i) support and deepen the implementation of financial reforms initiated under the stabilization and structural adjustment programs; (ii) stimulate private sector participation in these activities; (iii) commercialize these activities by drastically reducing government involvement, making them more responsive to free market prices and commercial bank financing and less dependent on budgetary subsidies; (iv) rehabilitate rural roads and transportation that are essential for increased agricultural production; (v) rehabilitate, on pilot basis, abandoned and underutilized commercial farms in areas of high production potential; and (vi) promote women's access to credit and job opportunities generated by the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":27},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"TA,BC,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,25,78","mjthemecode":"10,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":42},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":31},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":27}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0006020538262","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0006020538262","DocDate":"05-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121135374","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121135374","DocURL":"28-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e12531_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e12531_1_0","DocDate":"08-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002181431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002181431","DocDate":"24-JUL-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia"}},"facets":{}}
