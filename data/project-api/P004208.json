In confirmation with this goal, the objectives of the project are to foster the development of efficient land markets and to facilitate domestic resource mobilization by providing a system of clear and enforceable land use ownership rights, and by developing a land valuation capacity. The project will support the first seven years of a longer term national land titling program aimed at extending secure land ownership and developing land administration and valuation systems, including compiling a cadastral mapping system. The main components of the project are: 1) completion of the policy and legal framework for land management and administration; 2) implementation of an accelerated land titling program; 3) improvements in the infrastructure, facilities and systems for land administration; 4) improvements in land valuation; 5) support for project management and implementation, and institutional strengthening; and 6) studies on community land tenure and registration, definition of forest boundaries, cost recovery, land rights issues on nationalized lands and socio-economic impact of land titling."},"country_namecode":"Lao People's Democratic Republic!$!LA","sector1":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"20,730,000","sector":[{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LA","sectorcode":"BH,BC,BG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"36,75,83","mjthemecode":"11,10,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20060725142614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20060725142614","DocDate":"27-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122065810","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122065810","DocURL":"07-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122065810","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122065810","DocDate":"07-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961008054556","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008054556","DocDate":"21-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019135223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019135223","DocDate":"21-FEB-1996"}],"countryname":"Lao People's Democratic Republic"}},"facets":{}}
