President Yayi's Government has demonstrated a renewed commitment to a substantive reform agenda since earning a second mandate and enjoying a majority coalition in the National Assembly. Over the past 18 months the Government has implemented difficult reforms at the port of Cotonou, has proceeded with meaningful anticorruption efforts, has made progress in strengthening public financial management, public procurement processes in particular, civil service reform has accelerated, and important steps have been taken in improving the business enabling environment. Some of these efforts were met by stiff resistance, and implementation is proving difficult. The Government has nonetheless demonstrated considerable resolve in proceeding with this reform agenda. Eight PRSC supports this reform effort, strengthens and reinforces the substantial progress achieved in these key areas and provides needed financial resources to help maintain macroeconomic stability."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>B\u00e9nin \u2013 Huiti\u00e8me don \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 \u2013 PRSC 8</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>L\u2019objectif de d\u00e9veloppement du huiti\u00e8me Programme de cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 pour le B\u00e9nin vise \u00e0 renforcer la gestion, l\u2019administration et la gouvernance du secteur public ainsi que l\u2019environnement commercial.
