The changes address challenges resulting from pursuing a complex public administration reform agenda in an increasingly difficult political reform and worsening security environment with diminishing government commitment and implementation capacity constraints on the part of the project's implementing agency the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC). The restructuring will recalibrate the project's development objectives to focus on more attainable priorities, adjust the project's scope to focus on areas with stronger government ownership; and strengthen implementation arrangements within the IARCSC. The modifications will focus the project and expected results on introducing core building blocks for more effectiveness and transparency in the management of human resources in the public sector, including adoption of new recruitment procedures, development of a more systematic approach job grading and associated pay levels; and introduction of human resource management functions in selected line ministries. It will thus contribute to the adoption and enforcement of a more orderly, fair and uniform system for the administration of public sector employment. Reforming the selection, management and development of the human resources across all sectors continues to be a critical need and prerequisite for the long term process of strengthening public administration and service outcomes."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"20,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Implementation Status and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Project Paper,Financing Agreement,Technical Annex,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AF","sectorcode":"BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25","mjthemecode":"2,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120209233800","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120209233800","DocDate":"25-JAN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20110316001130","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110316001130","DocDate":"14-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000356161_20110316025426","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110316025426","DocDate":"01-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010121717382014","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010121717382014","DocDate":"17-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20100817035017","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100817035017","DocDate":"30-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000334955_20091030022319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20091030022319","DocDate":"29-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"007888127_2007071215203727","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007888127_2007071215203727","DocDate":"17-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000020953_20070510091223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070510091223","DocDate":"30-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20070328095722","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20070328095722","DocDate":"26-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20070326095224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20070326095224","DocDate":"03-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20051103124404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20051103124404","DocDate":"03-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20051101105551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20051101105551","DocDate":"24-OCT-2005"}],"countryname":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan"}},"facets":{}}
