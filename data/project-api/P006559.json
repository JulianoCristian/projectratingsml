The project has three components.  a) The infrastructure and equipment investment component will support the construction of the rail connection between the two CPTM suburban train systems.  b) The air quality component will support the construction of a vehicle emission and noise laboratory along with hardware and software, in order to develop the capacity for air quality modeling and emissions investigation within the Environmental Technology Company (CETESB).  c) The institutional and policy development component will assist in carrying out the concession of CPTM, establishing a Regional Transport Coordination Commission for the SPMR (Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region), and preparing an integrated transport, land use, and air-quality management strategy for the SPMR."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BH,TZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,84","mjthemecode":"11,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":86},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050701142200","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050701142200","DocDate":"24-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123160724","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123160724","DocURL":"07-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123160523","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123160523","DocDate":"07-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123160422","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123160422","DocURL":"07-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123160422","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123160422","DocDate":"07-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123160724","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123160724","DocDate":"07-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429111255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429111255","DocDate":"03-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185110","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
