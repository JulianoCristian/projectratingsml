It covers renewable natural resources-forests, fisheries, biodiversity and environment-as well as the country's mining (mostly manganese) and oil sectors. With regard to forest, fisheries, biodiversity and environment, the proposed loan will support the reform agenda set forth in the May 2004 letter of Sector Policy which will be implemented through the national multi-donor Forest, Fisheries, Biodiversity and Environment Sector Program (FESP). The proposed loan will also support Gabon's participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) for oil and mining revenues, and it will lay the foundation for broader reforms in the mining sector. Policies supported by the proposed loan focus on enhancing transparency, accountability and law enforcement, on improving the business climate, on ensuring equitable sharing of revenues, and on protecting the resource-base and natural ecosystems."},"country_namecode":"Gabonese Republic!$!GA","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Indigenous Peoples Plan,Environmental Assessment,Resettlement Plan,Program Information Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GA","sectorcode":"LC,LS,AZ,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP,JOB","themecode":"80,82","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership,Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","code":"LS"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP,JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":50},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20120123003815","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120123003815","DocDate":"27-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011041717550095","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011041717550095","DocDate":"17-APR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"006685922_2007072713100022","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006685922_2007072713100022","DocURL":"13-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"006685922_2007072713100022","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006685922_2007072713100022","DocDate":"13-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20051104091053","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051104091053","DocDate":"19-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000160016_20050915153516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050915153516","DocDate":"01-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20050915105204","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050915105204","DocDate":"01-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000160016_20050914181336","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050914181336","DocDate":"01-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050811102124","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050811102124","DocDate":"01-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01060104462060","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060104462060","DocDate":"15-MAY-2001"}],"countryname":"Gabonese Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership,Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
