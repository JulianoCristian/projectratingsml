Its implementation objectives are to demonstrate the feasibility of targeted, efficient and cost-effective delivery of community nutrition interventions and execute a poverty-oriented program through a privately operated agency. The project consists of three major components. The first encompasses a nutrition program consisting of information, education and communication (IEC) interlocutors supported by supplementary feeding for the target population in urban areas and a small fund for research and development. The second component funds a water program in the targeted neighborhoods of the nutrition program. The third component is a pilot rural household food security program. As an integral part of these components, there will be a package of managerial health and technical assistance and training to build local capacity for nutrition/health services delivery, and a management information system for monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":23},"theme5":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"18,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"BC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Human development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,68,78,55,71","mjthemecode":"9,6,10,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":94},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01083004024820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01083004024820","DocDate":"17-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123361374","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123361374","DocURL":"26-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123361475","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123361475","DocDate":"26-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123361374","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123361374","DocDate":"26-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123361475","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123361475","DocURL":"26-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e23bf5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23bf5_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23bf4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23bf4_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019104714","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019104714","DocDate":"26-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000425970_20120518094136","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000425970_20120518094136","DocDate":"26-APR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
