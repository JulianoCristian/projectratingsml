It will support development of the planning and monitoring capacity of the Ministry of Technical Education and Vocational Training (METFP) and allow it to follow the labor market trends.  The project will also finance the development of sector specific vocational training centers, which will professionalize the formal and informal training system through restructuring and reorienting technical and vocational training.  Project components are as follows : a) institutional development : strengthening METFP's Directorates, creating a Labor Market Information System, and monitoring the VET Reform Program; b) training of sector personnel; and c) National Training Fund : creating the managerial structures and funding training activities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Togo!$!TG","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":35},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"9,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TG","sectorcode":"BC,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"65,66","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":65},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":35}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120581509","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120581509","DocURL":"05-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120581910","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120581910","DocDate":"05-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120581910","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120581910","DocURL":"05-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120581509","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120581509","DocDate":"05-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e085b3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e085b3_1_0","DocDate":"04-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929081334","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929081334","DocDate":"23-JUL-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929081519","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929081519","DocDate":"23-JUL-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of Togo","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
