This project has three main components: The first creates a comprehensive emergency management structure that coordinates and integrates risk reduction strategies, preparedness, response, and recovery. It also creates an insurance mechanism, establishing and expanding national catastrophic risk management and risk transfer capabilities by making liquidity readily available to resident owners of damaged or destroyed dwellings; reducing government fiscal exposure; ensuring the financial solvency of the pool; and reducing government dependency on the Bank and other donors. This first component also reviews legal reforms, and strengthens the municipal capability to regulate, plan, and implement disaster resistant development. Lastly, this component establishes a land information system while updating and improving obsolete registers and maps. The second component funds the development of a trauma program for adults, which sets up community mental health centers and programs for psychological and organizational support. The third component reconstructs permanent housing in earthquake-affected areas."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":47},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":2},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"505,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Housing construction"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"JA,BG,FD,BC,YC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Human development","Environment and natural resources management","Human development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"52,89,83,67,33","mjthemecode":"3,8,11,8,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","code":"FD"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":47},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070823120421","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070823120421","DocDate":"07-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01110604104385","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01110604104385","DocDate":"15-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201442424","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201442424","DocURL":"23-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201442625","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201442625","DocURL":"23-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00101905442154","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00101905442154","DocDate":"04-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9911240530580","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9911240530580","DocDate":"01-NOV-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
