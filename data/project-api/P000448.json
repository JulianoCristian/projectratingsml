Equally important in this project is the attempt to assist SOCADA, the CAR's major rural development institution, to become a more effective and financially sound development agency. As a means of achieving these objectives, the project aims to: (i) strengthen agricultural extension service; (ii) provide production inputs (fertilizer, insecticides) and agricultural implements; (iii) support applied research and seed multiplication programs; (iv) promote animal traction; (v) rehabilitate 950 km and periodic maintenance of 2300 km of feeder roads; (vi) construct about 150 village water wells; (vii) improve the country's five cotton ginneries; (viii) provide workshops and equipment to improve the maintenance capacity for SOCADA's agricultural transport fleet; and (ix) establish a project monitoring and evaluation system."},"country_namecode":"Central African Republic!$!CF","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CF","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925154432","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925154432","DocDate":"30-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05d4b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05d4b_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05d49_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05d49_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902421856","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902421856","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901004260","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901004260","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"}],"countryname":"Central African Republic"}},"facets":{}}
