Its major components include: (i) construction of 66-kV and 22-kV transmission extensions (consisting of about 75 km of power transmission lines, about 8 km of underground cables and 275 MVA of transformer capacity); (ii) extensions to the distribution system; (iii) construction of a system control center; (iv) consulting services to carry out various studies; and (v) training. The project is the least-cost solution for the transmission and distribution of electricity for meeting forecast demand; improvement in the reliability of electricity supply and reduction in system losses as well as increased efficiency in the operation of CEB."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mauritius!$!MU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MU","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c48_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c48_1_0","DocDate":"04-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c47_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c47_1_0","DocDate":"04-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e95ed7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95ed7_1_0","DocDate":"04-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902301727","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902301727","DocDate":"31-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912291328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912291328","DocDate":"31-MAR-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mauritius"}},"facets":{}}
