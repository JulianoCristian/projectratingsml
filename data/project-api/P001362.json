The project consists of two major components.  At the central level, it will strengthen the Commission for Higher Education, reform the Student Loan Scheme, carry out relevant studies, support applied research, and implement the project.  At the six public university institutions, the project will support subprojects concerned with institutional development, staff development in key areas, and the supply of teaching and related equipment, especially for science and engineering."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":84},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"55,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"66,27","mjthemecode":"2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":84},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00010705302624","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00010705302624","DocDate":"22-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121054993","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121054993","DocURL":"11-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121054192","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121054192","DocURL":"11-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121055594","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121055594","DocURL":"11-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121055594","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121055594","DocDate":"11-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121054192","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121054192","DocDate":"11-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121054993","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121054993","DocDate":"11-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e393c2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e393c2_1_0","DocDate":"14-NOV-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
