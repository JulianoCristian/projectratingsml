They entail (a) construction of small scale flood control, drainage and irrigation subprojects; and (b) rehabilitation of infrastructure damaged or destroyed during the 1987 floods. Specifically, the project includes:  (a) construction of permanent water control structures in about 200 small subprojects; (b) construction of about 15 new subprojects requiring both earthworks and structures; (c) procurement of vehicles and equipment; and (d) provision of technical assistance and training to assist BWDB in institution building.  Under this project the World Food Programme (WFP) intends to provide food in exchange for work to be carried out under specific project activities.  Subprojects are to be selected during project implementation in accordance with guidelines agreed during negotiations."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":48},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"sector3":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"81,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"WC,BC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,51,78,52","mjthemecode":"6,10,6,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":48},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961219134431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219134431","DocDate":"25-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123230329","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123230329","DocURL":"19-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123230832","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123230832","DocURL":"19-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123230631","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123230631","DocURL":"19-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123230430","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123230430","DocURL":"19-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08234_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08234_1_0","DocDate":"26-JAN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926131508","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926131508","DocDate":"22-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.2","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926131506","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926131506","DocDate":"22-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926131503","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926131503","DocDate":"22-DEC-1987"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
