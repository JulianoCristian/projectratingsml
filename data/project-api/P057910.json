It is also to assist the Federal and Sate Governments to choose from among the best options and encourage them to implement sound reforms. State pension reform comprises four phases: (a) technical preparedness and diagnostic; (b) elaboration of pension reform proposals; (c) design of required institutional framework; and (d) implementation of reform proposals. The first project component addresses the adaptation of the Pension Reform Options Simulation Toolkit (PROST) to Brazilian reality. The second project component addresses the training of Federal and state employees in pension management and reform and in PROST through the support of consultants and workshops. The third project component addresses government activities, such as studies and dissemination of best case Pension fund management and Federal pension obligations and the design of an information system linking the Ministry of Social Security and Social Assistance with states' pension data bases."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rule of law","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"54,33,30","mjthemecode":"2,3,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060822094341","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060822094341","DocDate":"16-AUG-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201404565","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201404565","DocURL":"28-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201404364","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201404364","DocDate":"28-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201404263","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201404263","DocURL":"28-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201404364","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201404364","DocURL":"28-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201404565","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201404565","DocDate":"28-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201404263","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201404263","DocDate":"28-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703532376","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703532376","DocDate":"28-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980901092413","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980901092413","DocDate":"03-JUN-1998"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
