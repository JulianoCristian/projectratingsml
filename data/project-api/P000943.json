The first is to promote the growth of an efficient, competitive, well regulated, non-bank financial sector and an efficient payments system in order to: 1) increase the mobilization of domestic savings in both formal and informal sectors; 2) facilitate the flow of international capital into Ghana through better financial intermediation; and 3) supply financial services competitively to the economy.  The second objective is to create an environment conducive to greater private sector activity and support the successful implementation of the divestiture program for state owned enterprises (SOE) and the three largest state-owned commercial banks.  The project addresses identified gaps in the non-bank financial sector including: capital markets institutions such as the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE), Securities Regulatory Commission (SRC), and the Bank of Ghana (BOG), and contractual savings institutions, such as National Insurance Commission (NIC), State Insurance Corporation (SIC), Ghana Reinsurance Organization (GRO), and Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT).  The project also provides for associated financial infrastructure (domestic payments system) and capacity building in the non-bank financial institutions sector and diagnostic studies at the Ministry of Finance to enable the Government of Ghana to prepare strategies for future actions in expanding the provision of financial services to rural and informal sectors."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":63},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"23,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"ET,BE,BC,FZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"42,44,43,34","mjthemecode":"3,4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":63},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Education","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03020504012640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03020504012640","DocDate":"15-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182008","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182008","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121272293","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121272293","DocURL":"26-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121272293","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121272293","DocDate":"26-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23f5c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23f5c_1_0","DocDate":"05-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961008071420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008071420","DocDate":"06-NOV-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
