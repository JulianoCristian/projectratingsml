The project consists of three components. First, policy framework and capacity building will develop definitions of the appropriate roles of higher education institutions -- universities, professional institutes, and technical training centers; establish policies and mechanisms to facilitate transfer of students and graduates between institutions; propose amendments to present and proposed laws; develop policies and new working procedures in the various types of higher education institutions; and build capacity for management at the various educational institutions. Second, quality assurance will consolidate the national system for quality assurance; establish a qualification framework for study programs; and design and implement a quality awareness campaign. Third, financing will establish a coherent policy basis as the foundation for a funding methodology; increase accountability and develop a funding methodology; establish a competitive fund to promote quality and relevance; and assess and revise the student loan and scholarship schemes to increase equity in access and opportunities for further education."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":82},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"sector3":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"145,450,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"BG,EV,BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development","Rule of law"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"33,65,66,61","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,8,8,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":82},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Education","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20051228133358","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051228133358","DocDate":"08-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201412492","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201412492","DocURL":"15-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052010005318","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052010005318","DocDate":"15-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201412492","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201412492","DocDate":"15-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000178830_98111703554935","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703554935","DocDate":"19-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101024","DocDate":"06-MAR-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
