These improvements will be effected through the provision of : a) transmission lines and substations; b) a load dispatch system to control power system operations; and c) an economic and commercial framework to encourage better use of the available energy.  Components include : 1) over 3,000 circuit km of high voltage transmission lines; 2) 2,500 MVA of substation capacity; 3) several control centers; 4) a communication system; and 5) compensatory afforestation.  The project will strengthen NHPC's organization and help develop the newly formed National Power Transmission Corporation (NPTC).  The technical risks associated with the first time use of 765 kV lines and the use of 400kV lines at high altitudes are being managed by employing suitable consultants."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"485,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,74","mjthemecode":"9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042817231671","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042817231671","DocDate":"05-OCT-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040615514172","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040615514172","DocDate":"03-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042916374573","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042916374573","DocDate":"03-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928102618","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928102618","DocDate":"04-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928102440","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928102440","DocDate":"04-JUN-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
