The three micro-finance institutions are Credit Rural (a rural community-based credit scheme), Credit Mutuel (a credit union-type of structure that caters to small businessmen, traders, and civil servants), and Le Programme Integre pour le Developpement de l'Entreprise (PRIDE) (a traditional micro-finance nongovernmental organization focusing on women-owned informal activities and enterprises). There are three components. The first sets up a micro-finance support and monitoring unit which manages a general performance-based institution building program that trains central bank staff in financial and institutional management, and builds model credit unions. The second component consists of specialized assistance for each institution in the form of investments, specialized consulting, and performance-based incentives. Specifically, capacity-building for the staff of the three institutions will entail advisory assistance and short-term consultants, training, and equipment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":62},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":36},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"BC,FA,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"34,44,43","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,4,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":62},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":36},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022614542805","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022614542805","DocDate":"21-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042115503506","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042115503506","DocDate":"21-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99030406230128","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99030406230128","DocDate":"25-JUN-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
