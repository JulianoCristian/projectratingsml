The project has the following three components: Component 1) will finance the implementation of Annual Operational Subprojects (POA Subprojects) aimed at improving rural education attainment and institutional development. Component 2) will increase the capacity of the Ministry of Public Education (MEP) to reduce equity gaps by supporting activities to identify, reach and monitor the delivery of pertinent supply and demand education services to regions with low education indicators and students from low income households. Component 3) will improve the institutional capacity of the MEP through inter-departmental integration strategies and working alliances across central, regional and school
