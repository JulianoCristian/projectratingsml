It would: (i) for construction trades: establish 22 new vocational training centers (VTCs), and equip a new production center for training materials; (ii) for industrial traces: establish one new VTC, extend and/or re-equip five existing VTCs and an instructor training institute; and (iii) provide technical assistance and training to improve training curricula and materials, upgrade instructors' skills, and strengthen the capabilities of MDHLR and MOIMR to plan, manage and evaluate vocational training programs. The project would provide lower income groups with opportunities to acquire skills which would make them competitive in the job market."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"38,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007235044","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007235044","DocDate":"10-FEB-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9748c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9748c_1_0","DocDate":"19-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902414391","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902414391","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901002731","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901002731","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
