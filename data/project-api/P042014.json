To this end, the project components will: 1) build the national capacity for biodiversity conservation, by strengthening the environmental, and biodiversity legal, and regulatory framework regarding sectoral strategies. The component will finance training; the preparation of protected area management, and planning guidelines based on market analysis and a financing strategy; and as well, feasibility studies for other eligible protected areas, comprising a biodiversity analysis, assessment of water management issues for expansion of species under legal protection. Furthermore, biodiversity inventory, mapping, and monitoring will be financed through consultant services, and necessary equipment; 2) establish community-based mechanisms for biodiversity conservation, and sustainable resource uses, through capacity building and activities for protected area management. This entails the promotion of nature-based tourism, increased public awareness, and, improved management and services for protected area management and biodiversity conservation. Additionally, a rural revitalization program will link conservation goals, and, a regional cooperation program for the Karst ecosystem conservation will be financed; and, 3) finance project management, and monitoring, which includes donor cooperation, and technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Croatia!$!HR","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":41},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":9},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":23},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"5,070,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"HR","sectorcode":"BH,BG,YW,BC,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"82,57,80,45,33","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"3,5,11,7,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":41},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080805003827","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080805003827","DocDate":"01-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052509482274","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052509482274","DocDate":"19-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02050804040824","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02050804040824","DocDate":"25-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00070706145365","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00070706145365","DocDate":"18-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02013004043333","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02013004043333","DocDate":"31-JAN-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Croatia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
