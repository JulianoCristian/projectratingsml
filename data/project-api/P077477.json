The project consists of 5 components.  The first component will support the decentralization process through: supporting the development of a national Local Government (LG) capacity building strategy; strengthening of the human resource development functions in LGs; supporting annual workshops; establishing an analytical and design basis for the development of a decentralization budget support instrument; supporting the national assessment system; operationalizing the planning guidelines and information systems; auditing the accounts of all LLGs for the first two years of the Project; and finally activities supporting the improvement of the LGs planning and implementation of projects which will be funded by the local government development grant (component 2).  The second component, local development grants, will be funded by an IDA Grant (unlike the other components which will come from a credit).  This component will continue and extend the financing of local infrastructure investment through supporting a system of central-local intergovernmental transfers.  The third component, local government capacity building will provide capacity building grants to LGs.  The fourth component, local government revenue enhancement, will finance technical assistance at both the policy and operational levels.  The final component, support to project implementation, consists of activities to support project management, monitoring, evaluation and audits of the accounts of the project.
