This will be done using the successful approach of the ongoing Food Security and Nutrition Project (SECALINE), and no change in emphasis is expected. The project will provide supplemental financing to the \"Fonds d'intervention pour le developpement\" (FID), a non-profit association that finances construction and rehabilitation of basic infrastructure, income generating activities and private sector support programs. FID has been funded by the SECALINE project but, with the expansion of FID to all of Madagascar and the faster than expected pace of execution, the resources available to FID under the ongoing project are expected to be committed by early 1996. During the project period it is estimated that FID will help to: 1) create about 5 million person-days of temporary employment on infrastructure projects; 2) develop health and education facilities; 3) develop 1,000 kilometers of farm-to-market roads; d) provide protection for 16,000 hectares threatened by soil erosion; e) develop 30,000 hectares of arable land; f) finance 1,200 contracts with micro and small enterprises as well as another 200 with artisans and skilled daily workers; and g) create approximately 2,700 permanent jobs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":20},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MG","sectorcode":"JB,JA,EP,TA,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"83,78,57,41","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,7,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00062905302525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00062905302525","DocDate":"01-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123374235","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123374235","DocURL":"05-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123374336","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123374336","DocDate":"05-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123374235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123374235","DocDate":"05-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123374336","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123374336","DocURL":"05-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e23f3d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23f3d_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23f3c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23f3c_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008040746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008040746","DocDate":"15-AUG-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Madagascar","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
