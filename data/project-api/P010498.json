The project components are three: The ESD credit component, channeled through private Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs), would provide medium and long-term financing to private sector firms, NGOs, and cooperatives for solar home system and village hydro pre-grid electrification, grid-connected mini-hydro schemes, and other renewable energy investments.  The second component would finance a pilot grid-connected wind farm project to be executed by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).  This pilot project is expected to demonstrate the commercial viability and long-run economic potential of wind power in Sri Lanka, and to catalyze future private sector wind farm development.  The third component, the capacity building component, will provide training and technical support for renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives by both the public and private sector."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Power","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"24,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Renewable energy"},{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"LD,LE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,44,81,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":96},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20040723134733","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040723134733","DocDate":"25-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20030610141505","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030610141505","DocDate":"04-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229181630","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229181630","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123433773","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123433773","DocDate":"22-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123433571","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123433571","DocDate":"22-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123433773","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123433773","DocURL":"22-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123433571","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123433571","DocURL":"22-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123433672","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123433672","DocDate":"22-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3970619110721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970619110721","DocDate":"27-FEB-1997"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
