The strategy covers six focus areas, and its pillars include: growth and the reduction of income poverty, improvements of the quality of life and social well being, and, governance and accountability. This project will support the government pursue its policy objectives laid out in the MKUKUTA, through financing for the execution of the government's FY07 budget. It would also provide the incentives to implement key economic, social and institutional reforms to strengthen the overall performance of the economy and contribute to poverty alleviation. Over the period 2005-2010, it is expected that the reform program under the series of five annual PRSCs will help sustain growth of around 6-8 percent annually, projected to result in a significant reduction in poverty. It would also help the government in making progress toward reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), namely, increase school enrollment and literacy rates, reduce child and maternal mortality, increase access to safe water, and strengthen the sustainability of development efforts. There are however several risks, among which the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) identified significant fiduciary risk, but recent assessments such as the joint HPC Assessment and Action Plan show significant improvements in this area in recent years, and put Tanzania among the best performers in Africa. Additionally, capacity for program implementation and service delivery at both the central and district level is weak, but programs are in place for key areas to strengthen capacity."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Quatri\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-4) en Tanzanie</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le quatri\u00e8me Cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-4) est le premier d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de cinq op\u00e9rations annuelles d\u2019aide \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de la Strat\u00e9gie nationale pour la croissance et la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 de la Tanzanie (MKUKUTA). La strat\u00e9gie couvre six principaux domaines et ses composantes sont notamment : la croissance et la lutte contre la pauvret\u00e9 mon\u00e9taire, les am\u00e9liorations de la qualit\u00e9 de vie et du bien-\u00eatre social, et la gouvernance et la responsabilit\u00e9. Ce projet aidera le Gouvernement \u00e0 poursuivre les objectifs d\u00e9finis dans la SNCRP via des financements pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019exercice budg\u00e9taire 2007. Il favorisera aussi la mise en place de r\u00e9formes institutionnelles, sociales et \u00e9conomiques cl\u00e9s visant \u00e0 renforcer les performances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de l\u2019\u00e9conomie et \u00e0 contribuer \u00e0 l\u2019att\u00e9nuation de la pauvret\u00e9. Au cours de la p\u00e9riode 2005-2010, le programme de r\u00e9formes dans le cadre de ces cinq PRSC annuels permettra d\u2019atteindre une croissance de quelque 6 \u00e0 8 % par an, ce qui devrait se traduire par un sensible recul de la pauvret\u00e9. Il devrait aussi aider le Gouvernement \u00e0 atteindre les objectifs du Mill\u00e9naire pour le d\u00e9veloppement (OMD), \u00e0 savoir, augmenter les taux de scolarisation et d\u2019alphab\u00e9tisation, r\u00e9duire la mortalit\u00e9 infantile et maternelle, accro\u00eetre l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une eau potable et renforcer la viabilit\u00e9 des efforts de d\u00e9veloppement. Il existe cependant plusieurs risques, dont un risque fiduciaire important clairement identifi\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00c9valuation de la responsabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re de la Tanzanie et le Rapport analytique sur la passation des march\u00e9s en Tanzanie, mais de r\u00e9centes \u00e9valuations, telles que le Plan d\u2019action et d\u2019\u00e9valuation conjointes HPC, montrent de sensibles am\u00e9liorations dans ce domaine ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, et placent la Tanzanie parmi les pays africains les plus performants. En outre, les capacit\u00e9s de mise en oeuvre des programmes et de fourniture de services tant au niveau central qu\u2019au niveau du district sont faibles, mais des programmes sont en place dans des zones cl\u00e9s pour renforcer ces capacit\u00e9s.</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Agreement,Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"JA,YZ,AZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Rule of law"],"themecode":"33,53,25,27,40","mjthemecode":"4,2,2,6,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000442464_20130719093433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130719093433","DocDate":"14-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"006993951_2006091515222051","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006993951_2006091515222051","DocDate":"05-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"006993951_2006091515222051","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006993951_2006091515222051","DocURL":"05-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20060419090238","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060419090238","DocDate":"10-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20060207100809","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20060207100809","DocDate":"29-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20051213091806","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20051213091806","DocDate":"12-DEC-2005"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
