Improved fishing craft and gear would enable fishermen to increase fish catches and production. The proposed pilot Fish Farming Development Center would also contribute to increasing marketed fish production. If successful, the Center would be the nucleus of a second phase expansion for the development of outgrower fish ponds. The project would also include funds for research, training, and studies. The majority of the prospective Project beneficiaries currently earn the equivalent of about US$80 per capita per year. At full development, beneficiaries' annual per capita incomes could be expected to have increased by about 50%. The principal risk the Project would face is that the ice plants and refrigerated stores would not be managed efficiently. This risk will be mitigated if the cooperatives receive the support and confidence of most of the fishermen in the areas they are serving. The cooperatives' ability to provide improved services would be a significant motivating factor."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"AF","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","code":"AF"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925042036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925042036","DocDate":"01-MAR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902354759","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902354759","DocDate":"30-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228bfb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228bfb_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912490433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912490433","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
