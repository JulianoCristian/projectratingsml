As a result of these crises - emergency situation due to the 2000 cyclone, and political turbulence in 2002 - the project objective became at risk because of two factors. First, a set-back in the earlier achievements because of a worsening of the causes of malnutrition in the project areas. Second, geographic areas that before the crises were not among the targeted project areas because the malnutrition rates were lower than national average - the cut-off for the interventions - now became target areas. The Government requested the project to assist in the response to the crises, with an expansion of its activities to the previously not targeted areas, as well as an intensification of the project interventions, and acceleration of activities in the already target zones. This report proposes a supplemental credit to Madagascar to cover the additional costs that were incurred to address the emergency situations. A serious deterioration resulted from these crises, which led to an increase of the risk of malnutrition in the cyclone areas, and in the cities during the political crisis. The supplemental credit meets the requirement for supplemental credit because of cost overrun due to exceptional circumstances beyond the borrower's control, and because it is currently not possible to reduce the scope of the project, being the credit mostly disbursed, and the remaining funds fully committed. The existing credit is being implemented in compliance with all covenants."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary
