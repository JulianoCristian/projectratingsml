It would help increase supply of skilled labor, improve labor mobility through retraining, and strengthen CONET's planning and operating capabilities. Curricula development, organizational strengthening, and increased participation of the private sector would improve effectiveness and relevance of vocational training. The project would finance construction and equipment of 30, and equipment of 5, vocational training centers, and purchase of 50 mobile units, thus doubling CONET's vocational training capacity. The project would also support reforms in technical education through introducing new curricula elements. A technical assistance component, including consultant services, training programs for CONET staff, and studies of CONET's operations and the Argentine labor market would ensure effective project implementation. The project faces no special risks although the success of the attempted improvements in curricula and CONET's operating efficiency will depend on the ability of CONET's management to depart from established practice and adapt the changes proposed under the project."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"58,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e95f04_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95f04_1_0","DocDate":"07-OCT-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e95f02_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95f02_1_0","DocDate":"07-OCT-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190236167","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190236167","DocDate":"30-SEP-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912500849","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912500849","DocDate":"30-SEP-1980"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
