The initial seven months delay in project effectiveness and the political situation in 2009 and 2010, which resulted in a military coup on February 18, 2010 and the Bank automatically triggering the OP.7.30, slowed down progress in implementation of project activities. The changes will allow the Government to complete activities already initiated while including new activities which take into account the increasing threat of A/H1N1 and the needs for consolidating the country preparedness to effectively respond to major A/H5N1 and A/H1N1 crisis."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Niger!$!NE","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government
