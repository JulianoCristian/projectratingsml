In line with this, the proposed project seeks to (i) address the acute power shortage at a major load center in the East China power grid; (ii) support development of a modern distribution network master plan for the city of Shanghai; (iii) promote efficiency in the Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Bureau through a staff training program; and (iv) encourage financial reform.  Accordingly, the project entails an extension of the existing coal-fired Wujing thermal power station by adding two generating units of 300 MW each; construction of associated 220 kV transmission lines and substations; provision of on-line computer control and automotic load dispatching system for the Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Bureau's (SMEPB) load dispatching center; a master plan study of the distribution network in Shanghai; and a training program."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u5434\u6cfe\u7535\u5382\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u7531\u4e8e\u53d1\u7535\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5236\u7ea6\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e2d\u671f\u589e\u957f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u589e\u957f\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u91cd\u89c6\u7535\u529b\u884c\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u6309\u7167\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u70b9\u5b89\u6392\uff0c\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u529b\u6c42\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u534e\u4e1c\u7535\u7f51\u4e3b\u8981\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e0a\u6d77\u5e02\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7d27\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u6d77\u5e02\u5236\u5b9a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u603b\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5458\u57f9\u8bad\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u6d77\u5e02\u7535\u529b\u5c40\u5de5\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u9f13\u52b1\u5b9e\u884c\u8d22\u653f\u6539\u9769\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u5b89\u6392\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5185\u5bb9\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u65b0\u589e\u4e24\u53f0300\u5146\u74e6\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7ec4\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u73b0\u6709\u71c3\u7164\u70ed\u7535\u5382\u5434\u6cfe\u7535\u5382\u7684\u88c5\u673a\u5bb9\u91cf\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u67b6\u8bbe\u914d\u5957220\u5343\u4f0f\u8f93\u7535\u7ebf\u8def\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u4e3a\u4e0a\u6d77\u5e02\u7535\u529b\u5c40\u8d1f\u8377\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8d1f\u8377\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u5c31\u4e0a\u6d77\u5e02\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u603b\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\uff085\uff09\u5f00\u5c55\u57f9\u8bad\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"190,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019171411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019171411","DocDate":"20-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032614471629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032614471629","DocDate":"03-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042715562230","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042715562230","DocDate":"03-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926051644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926051644","DocDate":"28-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
