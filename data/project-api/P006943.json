The project consists of three components.  The sector institutional development components will: a) strengthen policy coordination of sector planning and budgeting; b) support the design and implement an agricultural information network; c) support a shift of financial and technical responsibilities to regional offices; d) improve land use classification, assess ecosystems susceptible to soil losses and measure the extent and cost of the actual and/or potential damage to the natural resources base; and e) demarcate the boundaries of national parks, biological reserves, and other protected areas.  The agricultural research and extension component will: a) consolidate and/or foster the emergence of private technical assistance services for small and medium-size producers; b) transfer extension responsibility; c) concentrate research and extension activities on small producers; and d) develop a group extension approach to transfer simple and cost effective technologies to small farmers.  The land titling and settlement consolidation component will provide resources to: a) IDA for land titling; and b) the Ministry of Public Works and Transports for consolidation of small holder settlements by providing basic rural infrastructure."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Costa Rica!$!CR","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":77},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":23},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"41,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CR","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,27,75,40,25","mjthemecode":"2,4,10,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":77},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":23}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3961007194816","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007194816","DocDate":"12-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042310165109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042310165109","DocDate":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031711333610","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031711333610","DocDate":"10-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001124503","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001124503","DocDate":"18-FEB-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001124201","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001124201","DocDate":"18-FEB-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Costa Rica"}},"facets":{}}
