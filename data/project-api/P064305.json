There are three project components: 1) communal infrastructure rehabilitation and construction; 2) capacity building for communes, rural communities/local associations, and private sector (small contractors, consultants, artisans, skilled labor and nongovernmental organizations) --in very specific cases study tours could be envisaged abroad; and 3) equipment purchases, operating costs, staff training, audits, and studies for the social development fund."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":24},"sector2":{"Name":"Water
