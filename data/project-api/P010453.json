The project will strengthen Balochistan's institutions involved with environmental protection and natural resource use so they are better able to undertake their responsibilities; strengthen local communities and involve them in the design and implementation of natural resources development and management; improve provincial natural resources use policies so that natural resources are used in an efficient and sustainable manner; publicize environmental issues; and implement high priority operations and pilot programs to rehabilitate and develop damaged natural resources. The pilot programs are designed according to the objectives and strategies of Pakistan's National Conservation Strategy. They will allow policy formulators to monitor the effects of current policies and, if necessary, develop or change them over time. The project will also provide training to upgrade staff's skills, technical assistance to help with project implementation, and funds to prepare future natural resource management projects."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"14,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"AI,BH,AT,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,75,82,84,80","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11,11,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":43},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":33},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":22},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20041020092147","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041020092147","DocDate":"29-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123330340","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123330340","DocURL":"04-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123330441","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123330441","DocDate":"04-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123330340","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123330340","DocDate":"04-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123330441","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123330441","DocURL":"04-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b5c3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b5c3_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b5c1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b5c1_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005032010","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005032010","DocDate":"01-MAR-1994"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
