The reform program to be supported by this grant works to achieve these objectives through specific reforms in the areas of budget management, and the business environment. In the area of budget management, the grant would support concrete measures towards improving the transparency, and accountability of public spending, as well as in the allocation of resources, in line with medium-term priorities. In the area o f private sector development, the grant would help to improve the business environment, by making further progress on the design, and implementation of the private sector regulatory framework, and taking steps to improve the efficiency of publicly-owned enterprises. Project benefits include, a stable economy, through the promotion of reforms which will enhance medium-term fiscal sustainability, and adequate service delivery. Second, the assistance to authorities will benefit an articulated, and mutually reinforced sectoral reform agenda, backed by a consistent macroeconomic framework. Policy measures to promote private sector development, and growth will be a key component o f the overall reform package. Nonetheless, there is considerable uncertainty about growth prospects, and, the macroeconomic scenario is associated with substantial risks. The basis macroeconomic scenario for a sustained rebound in growth, and living standards assumes implementation of a coherent medium-term program of institutional strengthening and reform; continued, well-targeted donor support for Kosovo; and, a relatively favorable external environment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kosovo!$!XK","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"XK","sectorcode":"FA,YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Rule of law","Economic management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"41,21,34,29,27","mjthemecode":"2,2,3,1,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":40},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040915114135","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040915114135","DocDate":"29-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052412415142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052412415142","DocDate":"22-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20030527130644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030527130644","DocDate":"19-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03012304195949","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03012304195949","DocDate":"11-NOV-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kosovo"}},"facets":{}}
