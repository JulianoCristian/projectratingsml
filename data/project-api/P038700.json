Specifically, the project will: a) provide Jamaican students with adequate financing options to pay for their share of higher education on an ongoing basis; b) increase equitable access to tertiary education and improve targeting of subloans; and c) increase financial sustainability and administrative efficiency of the Students' Loan Bureau (SLB) through a consolidated student loan program. The project will support: a) the restructuring of the SLB to focus on loan approach, improved loan targeting and impact evaluation; b) the expansion of a targeted student loan program administered by the commercial banking system; c) the establishment of a grant-in-aid Fund for students least able to pay; and d) the development and implementation of a public awareness campaign to inform students and their families of policy changes with respect to cost recovery and financing options for tertiary education, including the Grant-in-Aid program."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"28,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"JM","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"65,66","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03010404005220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03010404005220","DocDate":"31-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200263793","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200263793","DocURL":"02-AUG-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200263994","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200263994","DocURL":"02-AUG-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019222117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019222117","DocDate":"01-JUL-1996"}],"countryname":"Jamaica"}},"facets":{}}
