These development programs, which result from the recommendations of Highway Master Plan Studies which each agency carried out cover: the construction of new roads; the reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing roads; the purchase of specialized equipment to assist the Roads Organizations in monitoring traffic and in acquiring and processing data related to the operations of their networks of interregional and regional (including primary, secondary and feeder) roads; and personnel training to assist the Roads Organizations in improving their standards of administering and maintaining their roads networks. Benefits of the highway sector loan would be improved communications and the lowering of transportation costs within the five Republics/Provinces. All sectors of the economy will benefit due to these improvements, and many outlying regions will be better integrated with the main traffic system, thus permitting a balanced development of the less-developed parts of Yugoslavia."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"148,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924212049","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924212049","DocDate":"29-SEP-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902321432","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902321432","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912430597","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912430597","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e45f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e45f_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e45e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e45e_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1979"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
