Concurrently with the installation of the tubewells, the Department of Agriculture of the Province, also assisted by consultants, will provide an agricultural support program, which will include three field trial and demonstration farms. Included in the consultants' terms of reference will be the preparation of feasibility studies for future stages of the tubewell program. The appointment of these consultants is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit. The Northwest Region Tubewells Project would include construction of tubewells and distribution systems to irrigate about 180,000 acres of farm land, operation of two field trial and demonstration farms, provision of an agricultural support program and project consultants, a study of drainage and water supply for irrigation in the area protected by the Brahmaputra Right Embankment, and provision of vehicles and other equipment required to repair the embankment."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"14,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Project Performance Assessment Report,President's Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3960924233544","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924233544","DocDate":"17-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912585647","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912585647","DocDate":"28-MAY-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"President's Report (PR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PR","EntityID":"000178830_98101902191879","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902191879","DocDate":"31-OCT-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903201224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903201224","DocDate":"30-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903172861","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903172861","DocDate":"30-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da5742_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da5742_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da5741_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da5741_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de3505_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de3505_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de3503_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de3503_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b11_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b11_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228aee_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228aee_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1970"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
