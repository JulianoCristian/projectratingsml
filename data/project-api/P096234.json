The changes are needed to allow enough time: (a) to complete the unfinished schools; (b) to complete the activities related to capacity building in teacher training and curriculum development; and (c) to disburse the remaining uncommitted amount of SDR 16.2 million (US$25 million equivalent) which will be used to construct six-classroom block extensions (including toilets) in approximately 50 schools. These remaining funds exist because: (i) the SDR exchange rate has fluctuated in favor of the USD1; (ii) the amount of funding originally planned for school construction supervision consultants is no longer required since supervision moved to the Directorates of Education (DOEs) in 2011; and (iii) there is an unallocated amount of SDR3 million (US$4.6 million equivalent)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Iraq!$!IQ","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":49},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":49},"sector3":{"Name":"Central
