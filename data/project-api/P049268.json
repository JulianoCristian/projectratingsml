The project builds on the experience of the first Social Protection Project, which safeguarded critical social programs during 1995-96 and provided income support to the poor unemployed, including through the first phase of TRABAJAR.  The project will be composed of many sub-projects which will be presented by municipal and provincial governments, private groups, and national organizations.  They will be small, quickly implemented, labor-intensive investments in the areas of economic and social infrastructure.  The menu of projects which are eligible for financing by the TRABAJAR program includes minor construction, repair, expansion, or remodeling of schools, health facilities, basic sanitation facilities, small roads and bridges, small dams and canals, community kitchens and centers, and tourist centers.  The program encourages projects that are located in poor communities.  The second component of the project will be project administration, or management of the program by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security.  This will include project management, monitoring, and supervision costs."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"BC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"56,54","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00030705302521","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00030705302521","DocDate":"14-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172431","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201380047","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201380047","DocURL":"07-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201380047","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201380047","DocDate":"07-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170922","DocDate":"02-JUN-1997"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
