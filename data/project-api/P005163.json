These objectives will reinforce and expand the goals of the national family planning program. The project consists of two major components: 1) capacity building, which will help install capacity in the population and Family Planning Sector of MOHP for a set of key functions including policy and program development, business planning, sectoral manpower development and training, research programming, planning, resource mobilization, supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and public/nongovernmental organizations/local community program coordination; and 2) population activities program, which will include projects to increase awareness of population issues, to strengthen motivation for couples to plan their families, to facilitate access to and use of reproductive health services, and to educate and motivate people in such related areas as child nutrition, safe motherhood, male awareness, and delayed age of marriage."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":66},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"17,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"BC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"69,59,57","mjthemecode":"7,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":66},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20080721001956","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080721001956","DocDate":"25-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20051201112454","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051201112454","DocDate":"21-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122065609","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122065609","DocURL":"01-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122065609","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122065609","DocDate":"01-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23c4d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23c4d_1_0","DocDate":"21-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008072254","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008072254","DocDate":"26-FEB-1996"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
