Specifically, the project seeks to lift transmission constraints that hinder an open access of publicly as well as privately owned power generators to the grid and to support Interconexion Electrica SA (ISA) as transmission network operator, system generation dispatcher and commercial transactions coordinator. The project will be a key component of the comprehensive power sector restructuring that is being put in place with Bank assistance. The project consists of three components: 1) Energy control Center (ECC) and Financial Settlement Center (FSC); 2) strengthening and expansion of the interconnected transmission system; and 3) technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and
