The project comprises the following major components: 1) substation modernization program, consisting of the modernization of strategic substations in the Western and Central-Western regions of Poland to meet the design performance levels required for the system reliability and international interconnections and shunt reactive compensation at specific substations to ensure steady voltage control; 2) the 220 kilovolt line modernization program; and 3) technical assistance to PPGC."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"160,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,39","mjthemecode":"4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20050216094143","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050216094143","DocDate":"28-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200215401","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200215401","DocURL":"25-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200215502","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200215502","DocDate":"25-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200215401","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200215401","DocDate":"25-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200215502","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200215502","DocURL":"25-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb83_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb83_1_0","DocDate":"28-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb82_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb82_1_0","DocDate":"28-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008074242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008074242","DocDate":"03-NOV-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland"}},"facets":{}}
