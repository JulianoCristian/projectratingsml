The project will have two inter-related components. The first one involves institutional strengthening and hazardous waste management. This component will: 1) improve the capabilities of federal, state and municipal authorities for more effective environmental management; 2) help develop a strategy to implement the government's national policy on hazardous waste and carry out a pilot program to test the use of transportable treatment units; 3) support initiatives to protect ecological areas and biodivesity; and 4) support planning and preparation of future actions. The second component involves environmental services improvement. This component will address the border's most serious environmental problems associated with urban pollution: 1) water supply and sanitation; 2) solid waste; 3) air quality, urban transport, and paving."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection
