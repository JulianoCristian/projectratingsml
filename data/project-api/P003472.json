The proposed project supports the Government's objectives of increasing railway capacity  and improving its operations and efficiency.  It will also further develop the Ministry of Railway's (MR's) technical and managerial capabilities and contribute to the overall economic growth of the country.  The project consists of four components:  (a) double-tracking and partial electrification of the 492 km single-track line between Yueshan in Henan province and Xiangan in Hubei province; (b) expanding capacity and improving quality of manufacture in three locomotive and rolling stock factories, one near Beijing, and the others in Sifang and Qiqihar; and (c) a study to develop a strategic plan in the areas of telecommunications and computerization, to be pilot-tested on the Beijing-Shanghai railway corridor.  Finally, the project entails (d) training and technical assistance related to the Factory Modernization component and to the Strategic Plan Study."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u7b2c\u56db\u94c1\u8def\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u662f\u4e16\u884c\u8d44\u52a9\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u94c1\u8def\u884c\u4e1a\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5c06\u652f\u6301\u653f\u5e9c\u90e8\u95e8\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u52a0\u94c1\u8def\u8fd0\u529b\u53ca\u6539\u5584\u94c1\u8def\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u4e24\u5927\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u94c1\u9053\u90e8\u7684\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u8bbe\u6709\u56db\u9879\u5185\u5bb9\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5bf9\u6cb3\u5357\u6708\u5c71\u81f3\u6e56\u5317\u8944\u6a0a492\u516c\u91cc\u5355\u8f68\u94c1\u8def\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u8f68\u6539\u9020\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u6539\u9020\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e09\u5bb6\u673a\u8f66\u8f66\u8f86\u5382\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u5bb6\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5317\u4eac\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u53e6\u4e24\u5bb6\u5206\u522b\u4f4d\u4e8e\u9752\u5c9b\u56db\u65b9\u548c\u9f50\u9f50\u54c8\u5c14\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5c31\u7f16\u5236\u7535\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5316\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u8be5\u89c4\u5212\u5c06\u5728\u4eac\u6caa\u94c1\u8def\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bd5\u70b9\u5b9e\u65bd\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u5c31\u5de5\u5382\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u548c\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u6280\u672f\u63f4\u52a9\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48","mjthemecode":"5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042716135774","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042716135774","DocDate":"27-DEC-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032615160375","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032615160375","DocDate":"25-JAN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926180103","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926180103","DocDate":"02-JUN-1988"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
