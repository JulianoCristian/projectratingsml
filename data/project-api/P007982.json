The project would provide for training of staff as well as construction, furnishing and equipping of health facilities in four regions of Peru. The facilities would serve about 3.5 million people, most of whom live in absolute poverty and suffer from high rates of mortality and morbidity. The delivery system would also support efforts in the fields of population planning and nutrition improvement. The Bank loan would provide funds for maintenance facilities, project administration, project monitoring, health education and improving management in the MOH. Finally, the loan would include funds for the preparation of a further primary health care project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"33,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"HB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Basic health","code":"HB"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e977f5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e977f5_1_0","DocDate":"30-NOV-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902404278","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902404278","DocDate":"30-NOV-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912593016","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912593016","DocDate":"31-OCT-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
