The loan would support the first objective through policy reforms and measures to modernize urban planning standards and regulations; restructure and refocus public sector housing agencies, and enterprises; and, rationalize and simplify real estate taxes and subsidies. The second objective would be supported by reforms and measures to expand urban slum upgrading, and social housing programs through market-friendly approaches, will improve the efficiency of the residential rental market, and, will expand the access of informal sector and low-income households, to market-based housing finance. However, identified risks concern coordination among the institutions involved; the pace of implementation of the slum upgrading program, and of the Public Housing Operators (OPH) restructuring, and in addition, the potential delays in the legislative reforms for the urban planning code, residential rental sector and real estate taxation, and subsidies, most importantly, the absence of land titling reform. Despite these factors, macroeconomic risks are found to be not critical to the success of reforms."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Housing finance","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":16},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Housing finance"},{"Name":"Housing construction"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"BC,YC,FC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,27,44,54,40","mjthemecode":"4,6,4,2,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Housing finance","code":"FC"},{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":40},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100728235807","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100728235807","DocDate":"29-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090814004644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090814004644","DocDate":"18-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000334955_20080709031354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080709031354","DocDate":"30-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2005102814532186","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005102814532186","DocURL":"18-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2005102814532186","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005102814532186","DocDate":"18-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050610090720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050610090720","DocDate":"01-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050630165533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050630165533","DocDate":"31-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000012009_20040210135843","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040210135843","DocDate":"09-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20040210125209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040210125209","DocDate":"22-JAN-2004"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
