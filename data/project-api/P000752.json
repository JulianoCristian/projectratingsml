The project supports Seed Policy Reform, through each of its two components. The components are : (a) Seed Enterprise Development; and (b) Capacity Building. The first component supports (i) the development of the informal seed sector; (ii) encourages private sector entry into the formal business; and supports (iii) the restructuring of the Ethiopian Seed Enterprise from a centrally managed parastatal to a decentralized and commercially oriented enterprise. The second component involves: (i) institutional strengthening; and (ii) human resource development, both in the formal and the informal sector."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":37},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":29},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"22,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"YA,AB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Human development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,26,68,75,79","mjthemecode":"10,10,8,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":37},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":34},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":29}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000020953_20071010102931","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20071010102931","DocDate":"21-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03052204060961","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052204060961","DocDate":"31-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121264273","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121264273","DocURL":"29-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121264273","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121264273","DocDate":"29-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121264072","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121264072","DocDate":"29-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121264072","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121264072","DocURL":"29-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e23ebc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23ebc_1_0","DocDate":"13-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23eb7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23eb7_1_0","DocDate":"13-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019100119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019100119","DocDate":"24-APR-1995"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
