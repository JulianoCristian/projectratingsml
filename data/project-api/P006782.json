The Rio Grande Multipurpose Project includes construction of facilities needed by 1990 to provide safe and reliable water supply to about 61,000 households currently without water or poorly served, about 10,000 commercial establishments, and 8,700 manufacturing and industrial concerns in the Department of Antioquia.  The power component of the project will help ensure availability of electricity needed in the Department, which is a productive center of major importance to Colombia's economy.  Project works comprise hydro-facilities on the Rio Grande including an earth-fill dam, tunnels, a 300 MW underground power station, a 22 MW surface power station serving as a pressure reducing facility, a balancing tank and a steel conduit to feed raw water to a potable water treatment plant to be constructed under a second phase of this development.  The project also includes the extension of a computerized data processing network, and staff training."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"164,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"PY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","code":"PY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019125347","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019125347","DocDate":"26-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716150454","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716150454","DocDate":"30-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99ae4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99ae4_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e99ae3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99ae3_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
