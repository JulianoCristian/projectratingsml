Its main purpose is the same as for all INCORA colonization projects, i.e. to provide small farmers with an alternative to either continued existence in one of the traditional rural areas of Colombia where subsistence farming still predominates, or migration to one of the already over-crowded cities, where open unemployment has reached an estimated 10 to 15 percent of the urban work force. About 3,500 partially established settlers and 2,800 new settlers would benefit directly from the Project. They would operate farms averaging 75 hectares when fully cleared, and would produce mainly beef, rice and pork for the Colombian domestic market. Each settler could expect to reach a net cash surplus level (above subsistence costs) of about US$1,000 per annum at full development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"8,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912404827","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912404827","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a652_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a652_1_0","DocDate":"04-MAY-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a650_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a650_1_0","DocDate":"04-MAY-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903182448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903182448","DocDate":"30-APR-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903202036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903202036","DocDate":"31-JAN-1971"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
