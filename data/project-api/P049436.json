There are eight project components: 1) Chongqing Municipal Solid Waste Management will provide a higher standard of collection and cleansing service through gradual expansion of the solid waste collection service to areas that are underserved. 2) Fuling Waste Water Management will eliminate the random wastewater discharges to the Yangtze River, by collecting wastewater through a system of interceptors, conveying the water to a downstream location for treatment and discharge. 3) Wanzhou Water Supply will finance the extension of treatment plant and the construction of a new one. 4) Nanbin Water Supply will improve the water supply to the city. 5) Water Quality Monitoring will set up facilities to provide essential system performance data, to measure project impact, and to develop a future environment and wastewater strategy. 6) Urban Management Information Systems will improve the management of urban construction and development by effectively using information management technologies. 7) Environmental Rehabilitation and Reconstruction will finance an immediate plan for infrastructure rehabilitation and promotion of conservation, heritage and tourism. 8) Institutional Strengthening and Training will support capacity building for managing urban environment and project and financial management."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
