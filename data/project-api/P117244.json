Rio de Janeiro state and federal Government of Brazil requested a single-tranche stand-alone Development Policy Loan (DPL) to help with the projected 2010 financing needs deriving from reduced projected revenues, mainly due to lower oil royalties, state taxes and intergovernmental transfers and increased expenditures on infrastructure associated with the Program of Accelerated Growth (PAC). Although financing needs are related to the current global and financial crisis, the policies supported by the proposed DPL are part of GORJ's medium-term reform program. Specifically, the loan supports measures that: (a) strengthen fiscal consolidation through reduced long-term fiscal risk, improved efficiency of tax administration and strengthened budget procedures and financial management; (b) improve quality and efficiency of the business registration process; (c) increase quality and efficiency of the basic education system; and (d) increase access to and efficiency of health services, especially for urgent and emergency health care in disadvantaged areas and for low-income populations."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":11},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"485,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"ES,JA,EP,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"28,25,40,67,65","mjthemecode":"8,8,4,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":67},{"Name":"Education","Percent":11},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":11},{"Name":"Education","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000370910_20110812102406","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000370910_20110812102406","DocDate":"16-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010121712135929","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010121712135929","DocDate":"17-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010082510514395","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010082510514395","DocDate":"22-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20100111232124","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100111232124","DocDate":"16-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090929111134","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090929111134","DocDate":"25-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20091104153823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20091104153823","DocDate":"24-SEP-2009"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
