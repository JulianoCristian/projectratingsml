The project would consist of: expansion of generating facilities by about 26 MW; power distribution to urban poor; vehicles and equipment; rural transmission and frequency conversion studies; and technical assistance for management and training. Benefits would comprise: (a) satisfaction of power demand in the LEC system until 1985 and its positive impact on economic, industrial and commercial activities; (b) improvement of LEC's management, staffing and finances; and (c) supply of electric power to about 5,000 low-income families in the Monrovia area. The risks involved in the physical implementation of the project are not greater than normal for projects of this type. However, there may be risks with respect to the implementation of the non-physical aspects of the project (e.g., management, training and financial viability of LEC), although measures have been included in the Loan and Guarantee Agreements to minimize them."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Liberia!$!LR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"LR","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901051654","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901051654","DocDate":"30-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902311116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902311116","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191225432","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191225432","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e350_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e350_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e34e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e34e_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Liberia"}},"facets":{}}
