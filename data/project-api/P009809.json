The project would directly benefit over 55,000 households under the area development and slum upgrading programs and some 500,000 people would benefit from improved sanitation facilities. The main project risks include delay in land acquisition for area development and limited capacity of the implementing agencies to handle this new kind of project. These constraints were kept in view in designing the project's size, scope and institutional strengthening measures. These considerations and the steps already taken by the state in land acquisition and in the recruitment of consultants required for institutional strengthening should minimize these risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"24,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"UH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban housing","code":"UH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925170013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925170013","DocDate":"21-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901020524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901020524","DocDate":"30-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101141","DocDate":"30-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e999f1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e999f1_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e999ef_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e999ef_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e999ed_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e999ed_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
