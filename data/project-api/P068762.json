There are three project components. The first funds subprojects which will finance the salaries of unskilled workers hired under small community works projects and, for some municipalities, a portion of the materials needed for construction. Possible subprojects include 1) minor construction, repair, expansion, or remodeling for schools, health facilities, and basic sanitation facilities; 2) small roads and bridges, culverts and canals; 3) community centers; and 4) pilot housing projects. The second component finances the final preparation and duplication operational manuals and related guidebooks, office equipment, personnel training, operating costs, and promotional campaigns and technical assistance activities. The third component finances project impact evaluation and external review as well as a management information system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"BC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"54","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":94},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20061002110709","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061002110709","DocDate":"20-SEP-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201532506","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201532506","DocURL":"20-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201532707","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201532707","DocURL":"20-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00021005305749","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00021005305749","DocDate":"20-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00042805302222","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00042805302222","DocDate":"18-APR-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
