The project would support development-oriented subprojects for improving marketing facilities at the producer, wholesaler and retailer levels. It would also help integration and coordination of various marketing activities. Investments would allow adoption of modern technologies of handling, packaging and delivering perishable products that would reduce product losses and costs, as well as improve the quality of products delivered to consumers.
