For the Second POW, a broader definition of the health sector has been adopted to include government health services, traditional and non-government providrs, civil society, and community groups. The objective for the period 2002-2006 is to continue to improve the health status of the population while focusing efforts on reducing inequalities in health. Furthermore, the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) outlines the following key objectives for 2002-2004: 1) Bridge the equity gap in access to quality health and nutrition services; 2) Ensure sustainable financing arrangements that protect the poor and 3) Enhance efficiency in service delivery. This project specifically supports the Government in achieving the abovementioned objective and supports the Ministry of Health in implementing its 2002-2006 POW through financing a portion of the combined Government and external assistance budgets for policy development and operational program activities. The Ministry of Health will focus on ten areas: 1) strengthening priority health interventions; 2) developing human resources for health services; 3) enhancing infrastructure and support services; 4) fostering partnerships for health; 5) improving regulation; 6) reforming organizational arrangements; 7) improving health sector financing; 8) improving financial management systems; 9) further strengthening management information systems and performance monitoring; and 10) linking with traditional medicine."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":16},"theme5":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"89,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Resettlement Plan,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development","Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"69,27,67,88,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,8,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080324022653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080324022653","DocDate":"21-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201333258","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201333258","DocURL":"16-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03013104005840","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03013104005840","DocDate":"13-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01102604030718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01102604030718","DocDate":"17-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0112210401465","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0112210401465","DocDate":"13-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_02112004013174","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02112004013174","DocDate":"30-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02112004013072","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02112004013072","DocDate":"30-SEP-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
