The immediate objective is to facilitate the project's implementation, in particular, the debt workout and loan recovery elements of the government's reform program. The longer-term objective is to promote institutional and skills development to sustain the reforms implemented under the parallel project, the Banking and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (BESAC). BELTAC's components are: (1) commercial bank institutional development, a twinning arrangement of the T & D Bank with a reputable foreign bank, with special attention given to advisory assistance and training for debt workout capacity building, and advisors to help assess the banking institution viability; (2) public enterprise financial restructuring aided by four short-term advisors financed to help carry out financial viability assessments for the two largest public enterprise defaulters; and (3) a legal reform program based on a pipeline of subprojects covering (a) the execution of judgments, specifically, strengthening the Bailiff's office; (b) the establishment of a collateral registry for movable property to facilitate collateralized lending; and (c) a public information campaign focusing on enterprise restructuring and liquidation, and training of legal professionals."},"country_namecode":"Mongolia!$!MN","sector1":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"2,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"MN","sectorcode":"BC,FA,BG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Rule of law","Rule of law","Rule of law"],"themecode":"33,36,34,32,43","mjthemecode":"4,3,3,3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":60},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02070304084468","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02070304084468","DocDate":"06-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172334","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172334","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123435586","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123435586","DocURL":"31-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123435586","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123435586","DocDate":"31-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145821","DocDate":"25-MAR-1997"}],"countryname":"Mongolia"}},"facets":{}}
