The project consists of: (i) selected water supply and sewerage subprojects; (ii) engineering and consulting services as required for design and construction supervision; (iii) studies and technical assistance to strengthen planning capacities for planning, marginal cost analysis and pricing, reduction in costs, and domestic waste water pollution assessment; and (iv) institutional development to improve operations and maintenance. Compared with past programs, increased emphasis is given to sewerage works and to small and medium cities rather than metropolitan areas. While covering urgently needed extension of services, this project will strengthen the capacity of the state water company to carry out more efficient planning of investments, improved internal revenue mobilization, and increased efficiency of operations."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":81},"sector2":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":19},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"280,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sewerage"}],"docty":"Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"WS,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Rural development","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,84,74,78,71","mjthemecode":"9,10,9,11,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":81},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":19}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042714005997","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042714005997","DocDate":"07-AUG-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042009193098","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042009193098","DocDate":"16-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032512142099","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032512142099","DocDate":"16-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927153026","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927153026","DocDate":"26-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927152756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927152756","DocDate":"17-MAY-1989"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
