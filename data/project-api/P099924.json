There are four components to the project. The first component is the Corporate Sector Component. This component would support the corporate sector in implementing appropriate accounting standards; ensure the sustainability and transparency of these interventions through the establishment of appropriate legal and institutional frameworks; and strengthen the statutory audit function. The second component consists of Public Sector Accountability. This component aims to enhance public sector accountability through the implementation of the Government's public sector accounting reform strategy, being the strategy currently being drafted to implement that part of the 2004 accounting Law that requires budget organizations and off-budget state funds to prepare financial statements in accordance with National Accounting Standards for Budget Organizations (NASBOs) which in turn are based on International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The third component consists of strengthening accounting, auditing and financial management capacity. This component will build long-term capacity in accounting, auditing and financial management. It will include the creation of an Azerbaijan Center for Professional Accounting, Auditing Training Education and Research (ACPATER) which will be subordinate to the Ministry of Finance, and have broad responsibility for strengthening Azerbaijan accounting, auditing and financial management capacity, including the implementation of this component. Finally the fourth component consists of project management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Azerbaijan!$!AZ","sector1":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":74},"sector2":{"Name":"Central
