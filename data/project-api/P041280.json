There are three main components. The Public Enterprise Restructuring and Privatization component supports the government's policy of divesting from productive sectors by contracting out the preparation and execution of transactions to specialized firms, reducing the number of public enterprises, addressing labor redundancies, and implementing a public information and communication strategy. The second component, Reform of the Post and Telecommunications Sectors, provides technical assistance that implements extensive reform, including privatizing the main operator and liberalizing telecommunications services under a new regulatory framework; and restructures postal activities designed to improve profitability. The Financial Sector component, the third component, supports privatizing, restructuring, or liquidating selected financial institutions; strengthens the legal and judiciary systems; and promotes the microfinance sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Togo!$!TG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"General information and communications sector","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General information and communications sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"TG","sectorcode":"BG,FZ,JB,CZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,78,40,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General information and communications sector","code":"CZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":57},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":17},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":14},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030508104404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030508104404","DocDate":"05-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123480758","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123480758","DocURL":"02-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980312102429","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980312102429","DocDate":"10-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184327","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184327","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052709405330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052709405330","DocDate":"08-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Togo"}},"facets":{}}
