The proposed additional loan would finance the cost of activities to amplify the impact and development effectiveness of this well-performing project. The additional activities would contribute to efforts to consolidate and deepen critical reforms needed to accelerate growth and reduce poverty in Panama. These new activities would be fully consistent with the Development Objectives of the ongoing Public Policy Reform Technical Assistance Project. There are 4 components to the project. Project Component A, Fiscal Sustainability and Public Sector Efficiency, is to support pillar II of the Government's strategic plan: to promote economic growth and employment. Project Component B, Social Spending and Poverty Reduction, will provide tools to monitor and evaluate poverty in Panama and specific related interventions. Project Component C, Public Procurement System, will deepen efforts already undertaken in this area by the Government. Project Component D, Project Management, will finance the provision of technical assistance, equipment, training, and operating costs (as necessary) to establish, operate, and strengthen the Project coordination and Project executing units."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Panama!$!PA","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de Asistencia T\u00e9cnica para la Reforma de la Pol\u00edtica P\u00fablica</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"10,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Paper,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PA","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Economic management","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"53,27,24,40,49","mjthemecode":"5,4,1,2,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000021321_2010050614391978","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010050614391978","DocDate":"10-MAR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2008092315041673","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008092315041673","DocDate":"10-MAR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2008092315041673","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008092315041673","DocURL":"10-MAR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000021321_2010050614403382","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010050614403382","DocDate":"10-MAR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000020953_20070423090433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070423090433","DocDate":"16-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2008092315022824","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2008092315022824","DocDate":"04-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01071704015883","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01071704015883","DocDate":"09-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01032612433234","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032612433234","DocDate":"19-MAR-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Panama"}},"facets":{}}
