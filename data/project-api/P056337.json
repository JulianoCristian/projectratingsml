The project consists of three main components. The first develops effective procedures for a technically and environmentally sound approach to formally closing uneconomic mines including building dams on both sides of mine barriers to prevent bursting due to accumulation of acid underground water build-up, acid water treatment, measures to prevent contamination of subterranean acquifiers, permanently sealing underground workings all mine openings, preventing gas leakage, demolition of surface buildings and structures, and environmental remediation that restores surface lands, protects waste dumps against mud slides or failed dump slopes, rehabilitates waste dumps, restores water courses, collects and treats polluted effluents, protects oil pipelines, and treats surface soil. The second component identifies the measures most effective in mitigating social hardships resulting from the sector's restructuring, and assists in creating diversified employment opportunities for redundant labor. The third component strengthens the agencies involved in restructuring the sector and introducing a modern mining licensing system."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Mining and other extractive","Percent":61},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":16},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":16},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"44,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Mining and other extractive"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"BC,FE,JB,LB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB,PPP","themecode":"87,51,27,40,82","combined_practice_name":"Jobs,Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"11,4,2,6,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Mining and other extractive","code":"LB"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB,PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":61},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":16},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":16},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070718085759","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070718085759","DocDate":"29-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201440914","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201440914","DocURL":"13-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201441115","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201441115","DocURL":"13-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99082405303161","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99082405303161","DocDate":"06-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000012009_20030905141233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030905141233","DocDate":"22-SEP-1998"}],"countryname":"Romania","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs,Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
