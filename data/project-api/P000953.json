The project is comprised of three main components:  (a) a portion of a time slice of the investment program defined under an IDA-financed National Electrification Planning Study, which will include connection to the national power grid of all of the district capitals that are not supplied from the grid; (b) re-inforcement of the ECG's existing distribution network by expanding substations, and building or replacing major links between substations; and (c) institutional strengthening of ECG through regrouping of all its commercial activities under one directorate and hiring an outside firm under a performance-based management contract to run this new directorate."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,74","mjthemecode":"9,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01081404043710","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01081404043710","DocDate":"29-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121151916","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121151916","DocURL":"09-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121152318","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121152318","DocDate":"09-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121152117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121152117","DocDate":"09-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121150615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121150615","DocDate":"09-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121151916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121151916","DocDate":"09-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121150615","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121150615","DocURL":"09-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121152117","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121152117","DocURL":"09-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121152318","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121152318","DocURL":"09-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e12289_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e12289_1_0","DocDate":"04-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e12288_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e12288_1_0","DocDate":"04-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e12286_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e12286_1_0","DocDate":"04-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004044916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004044916","DocDate":"04-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004044637","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004044637","DocDate":"04-FEB-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
