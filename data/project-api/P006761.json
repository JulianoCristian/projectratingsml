Of the project investments about 35% would be for sewerage works, 20% for distribution pipes, 17% for water production, 11% for engineering and administration, and the remaining 17% for pumping stations, storage tanks, meters and operation equipment, and technical assistance. The project would provide water through house connections to about 473,000 people in 19 cities by 1983, and sewerage services to 654,000 people in 14 cities by 1983; about half of this population belongs to poorest population earning less than one third of the per capita national income. The project presents higher than usual risks in that it may not be implemented in the intended period, principally because the borrower and the participating water and sewerage companies may not be able to achieve the forecast institutional and financial improvements within a short period of time. It is to be expected that the Government's commitment to strengthening the institutions in the water and sewerage sector together with close supervision"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"31,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924215043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924215043","DocDate":"30-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e90a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e90a_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e909_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e909_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902331763","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902331763","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912423464","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912423464","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
