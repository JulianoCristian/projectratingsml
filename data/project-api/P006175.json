The program continues to consist of small scale employment- and income-generating projects and social assistance activities, targeted to those suffering most from the effects of the economic crisis and the economic adjustment process, such as the short-term unemployed, particularly those affected by the collapse of the mining industry, and the rural poor, especially pregnant women, lactating mothers and pre-school children.  To that end, the project specifically provides funds for social assistance; social infrastructure; economic infrastructure; and support to production."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Social assistance","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"27,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Social assistance"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"SA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Social Protection","code":"SX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Social assistance","code":"SA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926161938","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926161938","DocDate":"22-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121474453","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121474453","DocDate":"04-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121474654","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121474654","DocDate":"04-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121474654","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121474654","DocURL":"04-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121474453","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121474453","DocURL":"04-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08261_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08261_1_0","DocDate":"01-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08260_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08260_1_0","DocDate":"01-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0825f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0825f_1_0","DocDate":"01-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e0825e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0825e_1_0","DocDate":"01-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926161655","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926161655","DocDate":"10-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926161807","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926161807","DocDate":"10-FEB-1988"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
