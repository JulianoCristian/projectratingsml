Over the longer term, the project will: (d) selectively increase the capacity and reliability of the distribution system so as to serve more consumers when the power shortage is alleviated; and (e) reduce the unit cost of power and power system investment by commercializing the power utility, improving the condition of existing power facilities, economic power pricing and by short-term technical assistance and training. The project consists of: (a) operation support, maintenance, spares, and major overhaul services and selective equipment upgrades for Hwange Power Station; (b) distribution system reinforcement through the installation of additional transformer capacity, line uprating, and installation of capacitors and load shedding devices; (c) training and technical assistance; (d) provision of workshop equipment and maintenance vehicles; and (e) completion of Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority's management information system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zimbabwe!$!ZW","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"ZW","sectorcode":"BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Urban development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,74,78","mjthemecode":"10,9,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0104210948210","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0104210948210","DocDate":"01-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121400408","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121400408","DocURL":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121400609","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121400609","DocURL":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99da7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99da7_1_0","DocDate":"18-JAN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e99da6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99da6_1_0","DocDate":"18-JAN-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zimbabwe"}},"facets":{}}
