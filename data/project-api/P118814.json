PRSO-6 will contribute to the achievement of these objectives through improving management of key areas (regional integration, private sector development, and quality of investment in natural resource sector) and through strengthening of public financial management and service delivery capacities and targeted poverty reduction programs. With the global economy on its way to recovery, Lao PDR's economy appears ready for another year of sustained economic growth, in which the start of Second Nam Theun (NT2) commercial operations will be an important pillar. Economic growth is expected to be increasingly driven by resource exports (especially hydropower and mining). In 2010, it is expected that the start of NT2 commercial operations will contribute significantly to economic growth in 2010. The recent recovery of commodity prices (especially metals and agriculture) and regional demand has boosted Lao export earnings in the second half of 2009 and will also encourage Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) rebound in 2010 and 2011."},"country_namecode":"Lao People's Democratic Republic!$!LA","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":29},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":14},"sector5":{"Name":"Non-compulsory health finance","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":44},"theme4":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory health finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document","countrycode":"LA","sectorcode":"FB,LT,BC,FA,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Public sector governance","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"67,27,49,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,5,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"},{"name":"Non-compulsory health finance","code":"FB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":29},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":29},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":14},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20121219011444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20121219011444","DocDate":"05-OCT-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010081715413993","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010081715413993","DocDate":"01-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20100604004615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100604004615","DocDate":"24-MAY-2010"}],"countryname":"Lao People's Democratic Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
