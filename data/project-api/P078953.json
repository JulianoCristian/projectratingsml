The first component will improve the quality of social policies and programs, taking into account the issue of decentralization, whether already decentralized, or subject to future decentralization; whereas the second component will implement Performance Agreements and Accreditation of social sectors, by ensuring adequate decentralization of the social programs, through the design, and implementation of the instruments for the accreditation process, particularly for social programs; implementing performance, and/or management agreements (PAS); and, by monitoring and evaluating budget transfers to sub-national governments. The third component aims at improving monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in the Social Sectors. The purpose of this component is to build M&E capacity by strengthening existing monitoring instruments, and establishing new ones as necessary, and strengthening analytical capacity among the different actors engaged in the implementation process."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Rendici\u00f3n de cuentas en la descentralizaci\u00f3n de los sectores sociales (antes Pr\u00e9stamo program\u00e1tico de asistencia t\u00e9cnica para la reforma social)</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"7,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,26,61,27","mjthemecode":"2,7,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":85},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20111025011543","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20111025011543","DocDate":"18-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010041615440224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010041615440224","DocDate":"16-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20040628115245","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040628115245","DocDate":"18-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000012009_20040415131513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040415131513","DocDate":"02-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20040414100227","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040414100227","DocDate":"02-APR-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
