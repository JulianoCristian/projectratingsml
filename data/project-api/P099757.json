There are four components to the project. The first component is the policy framework for scaling-up the development of geothermal power. This component will assist the Government of Indonesia (GoI) in developing and implementing an integrated set of policies that will provide sufficient regulatory certainty, risk mitigation, and economic incentives for increased public and private investments toward developing geothermal power in Indonesia. The second component is the transactions management for mobilizing investments in geothermal power generation. This component will assist the GoI, especially the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), to develop the capacity for planning and transacting geothermal power developments in an efficient and transparent manner. The third component is the geothermal sector technical capacity building. This component will help address the limited domestic technical capacity for handling most geothermal related activities, and support the long-term development prospects of the sector. Finally, the fourth component is the project management assistance. This component will provide the necessary technical consultant support to the directorate of geothermal enterprise supervision and ground water management, the executive implementation unit, for the management and supervision of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Other Renewable Energy","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Thermal Power Generation","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"4,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other Renewable Energy"},{"Name":"Thermal Power Generation"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BC,LG,LR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81","mjthemecode":"11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other Renewable Energy","code":"LR"},{"name":"Thermal Power Generation","code":"LG"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":50},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081cab850_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081cab850_1_0","DocDate":"25-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081ab1874_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ab1874_1_0","DocDate":"13-APR-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000445729_20130604094755","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130604094755","DocDate":"01-JAN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012042707071560","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012042707071560","DocDate":"27-APR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011062912320407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011062912320407","DocDate":"29-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20110629000524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110629000524","DocDate":"23-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20110629000302","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110629000302","DocDate":"22-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000333037_20080514235757","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080514235757","DocDate":"01-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000076092_20080425150054","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080425150054","DocDate":"23-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000076092_20080425143842","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080425143842","DocDate":"21-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000076092_20071108155046","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20071108155046","DocDate":"07-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000076092_20071108154539","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20071108154539","DocDate":"09-APR-2007"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
