This project extends the PA program initiated with global environmental facility (GEF) funding in 1992 and restructured as an endowment fund for 10 PAS in 1997 (Project SNAP I), by adding 12 new PAS to the program. There have been no substantial changes to the project's original objectives and design since Board approval."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican
