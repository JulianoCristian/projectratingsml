The project's major objectives are to: 1) provide water from a reliable source within the State to Madras on an urgent basis; 2) improve the distribution of water within Madras; and 3) strengthen conservation. The project will consist of the following: 1) source works at the existing Veeranam irrigation tank to the south of Madras; 2) a transmission pipeline from Veeranam to Madras, a distance of 235 km, with associated treatment and pumping facilities; 3) continuation of distribution improvements within Madras being undertaken in the First Madras Supply Project; 4) a water conservation program including physical works such as leak detection and repairs and tariff increases to encourage more efficient use of water; and 5) technical assistance in the form of project preparation and implementation support. Adequate steps will be taken to ensure people adversely affected benefit from the project where this is possible and otherwise are made no worse off as a result. To remove possible farmer resistance to the proposals at Veeranam, a new regime to regulate the flow has been introduced following consultation under which the irrigation flows will exceed those that would otherwise have occurred."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"275,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AI,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"62,78,85,74","mjthemecode":"9,11,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":99},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20041111094935","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041111094935","DocDate":"27-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e28_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e28_1_0","DocDate":"20-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e27_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e27_1_0","DocDate":"20-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e25_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e25_1_0","DocDate":"20-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e24_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e24_1_0","DocDate":"20-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e23_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e23_1_0","DocDate":"20-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e22_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e22_1_0","DocDate":"20-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019103836","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019103836","DocDate":"26-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961008021644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008021644","DocDate":"26-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110407","DocDate":"31-OCT-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110406","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110406","DocDate":"31-OCT-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
