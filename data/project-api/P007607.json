This will be done through: (a) investing in small-scale irrigation and other productive investments; (b) transferring both new and existing agricultural technologies through private sector extension; (c) reducing costs of soil erosion; and (d) strengthening the capacity of the executing agency. The project is targeted at small farmers in the ten states, chiefly in semiarid and temperate zones, with rainfall less than 1,000 mm annually and where moisture deficit is the main constraint to productivity. The operation will have three components: (a) rural investment; (b) agricultural technology transfer; and (c) institutional development and training."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":77},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":23},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"85,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BC,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Trade and integration","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,48,25","mjthemecode":"2,5,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":77},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":23}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00100705334942","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00100705334942","DocDate":"22-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123045989","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123045989","DocURL":"19-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123045989","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123045989","DocDate":"19-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123050391","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123050391","DocDate":"19-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123050190","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123050190","DocDate":"19-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123050391","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123050391","DocURL":"19-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123050190","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123050190","DocURL":"19-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea38be_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea38be_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081ea38bd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea38bd_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005144808","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005144808","DocDate":"15-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100525063804","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100525063804","DocDate":"15-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005144507","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005144507","DocDate":"15-JUN-1994"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
