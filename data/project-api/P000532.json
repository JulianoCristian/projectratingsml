The project comprises four components that will be implemented over four years: 1) establishing village-based natural resources management--this component builds the capacity to design simple long-term village land-use and wood exploitation plans for villages in the N'Djamena wood fuel catchment area by funding the technical assistance for nongovernmental organizations, forestry agents, and villagers to develop a master plan and thereafter manage and control fuelwood use; 2) building the capacity of the Agency for Household Energy and Environment to monitor and control wood product flow through charging collecting user fees/taxes; 3) improving the efficiency of household fuel use by commercializing efficient cooking stoves (firewood, charcoal); and promoting the use of low-cost kerosene and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) stoves with publicity and NGO-sponsored promotional activities as well as testing, product development, and monitoring of stove performance; and 4) capacity building and training as a part of project management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade","Percent":74},"sector2":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":16},"sector3":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"5,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade"},{"Name":"Renewable energy"},{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TD","sectorcode":"LA,LE,YY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,81,83,82,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,11,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other domestic and international trade","code":"YY"},{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"},{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":74},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":16},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050217124620","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050217124620","DocDate":"29-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121313327","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121313327","DocURL":"13-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121313327","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121313327","DocDate":"13-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121313226","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121313226","DocURL":"13-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121313226","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121313226","DocDate":"13-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980624143048","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624143048","DocDate":"04-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183859","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chad"}},"facets":{}}
