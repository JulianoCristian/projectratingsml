In accordance with these objectives, the project is composed of three components; firstly, investment in commercially oriented sub-projects via participating Hungarian banks. These sub-projects are grouped in three areas: R/D infrastructure, new industrial technology, and computer software. Second, the project will finance two pre-appraised investments in non-commercial, government owned entities which provide essential services to TD activities. Finally, the project will provide technical assistance to train staff from enterprises, Hungarian banks and government departments, and to assist in appraisal of sub-projects, and also to support the preparation of the next mid-range plan."},"country_namecode":"Hungary!$!HU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HU","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007225943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007225943","DocDate":"09-FEB-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926193927","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926193927","DocDate":"20-MAY-1988"}],"countryname":"Hungary"}},"facets":{}}
