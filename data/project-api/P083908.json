However, implementation delays and a subsequent funding gap for the northern transmission system have necessitated the restructuring of the IDA project to ensure achievement of the project objectives. This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to introduce the following changes in the Afghanistan Emergency Power Rehabilitation Project (EPRP), and any accompanying amendments to the project's legal documents. The proposed changes will (i) reduce the scope of the Kabul city distribution component and reallocate Credit proceeds to finance certain critical parts of the northern transmission system to allow the import of lower cost power to Kabul which i s fundamental to achieving the project's original objectives; (ii) modify the implementation arrangements o f the project by outsourcing project management to a firm to address the weak management capacity of the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW); (iii) revise the outcome indicator to increased power consumption by customers in Kabul by 70 percent; and (iv) extend the closing date by 20 months to September 30,2010. With respect to item (i) above, the new component will finance (a) a 110 kV transmission line to connect the new Chimtalah substation 11 km north of Kabul city to the Kabul subtransmission grid and upgrading of two existing substations and (b) fiber optic ground wire for the southern section of the 220 kV line between Pul-e-Khumri and Kabul. The scope of the original Kabul city distribution component will be reduced to focus on upgrading the medium voltage distribution system."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of
