The project would help BRPM to (i) complete the exploration of producing areas where marginally economic production prospects are likely to exist, and (ii) assess the petroleum potential of basins yet unexplored and develop \"leads\" which could attract private foreign investors to the development of Morocco's oil and gas reserves. It covers a three-and-a-half year slice of BRPM's on-shore exploration program. In addition, it provides for studies to help BRPM to assess several options regarding the development of the country's oil shale resources."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"GI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","code":"GI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912480311","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912480311","DocDate":"31-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902345468","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902345468","DocDate":"31-MAR-1980"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
