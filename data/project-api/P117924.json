This first development policy operation of a programmatic series of two (PRSC7 and PRSC8) supports the authorities' efforts to consolidate ongoing fiscal stabilization efforts and protect the development objectives set in the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) for 2010-2013. The GSGDA emphasizes the need for macroeconomic stabilization and greater executive efficiency, transparency and accountability to provide the adequate setting for the reduction of poverty and socio-economic inequalities through agricultural, private sector, infrastructure and human resource development. Specifically, the PRSC7 supports continuing and deepening policy reforms initiated in 2009 to: (i) restore budgetary discipline and (ii) tackle longstanding public sector and energy issues, while (iii) protecting the poor and (iv) preparing for the oil era. The operation is aligned with the recently updated World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives for FY08-12 and with the World Bank's Africa Action Plan. The operation is part of a larger program of support to Ghana that notably focuses on public financial management, public sector reform, energy and safety nets."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"215,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Financing Agreement,Summary of Discussion,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document,Tranche Release Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"LZ,JB,LC,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"27,54,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":25},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":13},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000171540_2011030411244698","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2011030411244698","DocDate":"04-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000333038_20110124023359","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20110124023359","DocDate":"20-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333038_20110218224930","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20110218224930","DocDate":"07-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000020953_20101207153657","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20101207153657","DocDate":"30-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20101019105302","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20101019105302","DocDate":"16-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000334955_20100618064624","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100618064624","DocDate":"31-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100107121042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100107121042","DocDate":"07-DEC-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
