The components will: 1) Consolidate, and promote Colombia's National Protected Areas System in the region, and, provide support in testing elements in key protected areas. Investments will strengthen existing protected areas, and, a participatory design, and implementation of conservation zones will contribute to build relationships among local communities, and traditional managers of protected areas, through workshops, training, and technical studies to improve the quality of information. 2) Support assessments of conservation opportunities in transformed landscapes, develop, and disseminate management tools for biodiversity conservation in rural areas, and develop institutional, and economic incentives. 3) Strengthen regional capacities through training efforts in taxonomy, for a unified biodiversity inventory collection. In addition, a decentralized biodiversity information system will be built. 4) Provide intersectoral coordination to promote inclusion of biodiversity goals in sector development plans for the Andes, through workshops, and improved monitoring practices."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Conservaci\u00f3n y uso sostenible de la biodiversidad en la regi\u00f3n alta de Los Andes (FMAM)</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":21},"sector4":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"AB,YA,BZ,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"82,80,57,76","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,7,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":29},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":21},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20080729083214","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080729083214","DocDate":"30-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042716431812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042716431812","DocDate":"20-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052110412913","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052110412913","DocDate":"29-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01030605394525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01030605394525","DocDate":"12-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0101300532195","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0101300532195","DocDate":"31-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99092905332951","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99092905332951","DocDate":"18-NOV-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
