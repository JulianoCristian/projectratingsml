The project will be executed over 5 years by the Ministry of Education and Sciences (MES). The first component will help MES to improve educational delivery mechanisms by financing the implementation of the following quality and efficiency measures: 1) strengthening the education performance evaluation and assessment system by financing institutional support for central and provincial evaluation services; 2) promoting more effective teaching and training practices for about 26,000 teachers, pedagogic and orientation counselors and inspectors at school, provincial and central levels; 3) strengthening the central and provincial MES administration and planning services to improve the existing information and feedback mechanisms between the different decision-making levels. The second component will provide support for improved access by financing: 1) the construction of about 30 upper-basic and 44 secondary schools; 2) rehabilitation of upper-basic and secondary schools in provinces and areas where these are mostly needed and the establishment of preventive school maintenance system; and 3) provision of instructional equipment, training and technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":48},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":48},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":1},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"98,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"BH,ET,BC,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Human development","Human development","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,78,66,65,71","mjthemecode":"9,8,8,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":48},{"Name":"Education","Percent":48},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Education","Percent":1},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02061709155761","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02061709155761","DocDate":"31-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042915533800","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042915533800","DocDate":"08-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041416092001","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041416092001","DocDate":"21-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea38e6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea38e6_1_0","DocDate":"23-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006223232","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006223232","DocDate":"04-AUG-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
