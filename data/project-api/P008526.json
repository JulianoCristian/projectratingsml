The project consists of two components: a) rehabilitation of DH system, through a program to upgrade the system to a variable flow regime; increase boiler efficiency; abate leakages; install heat meters; eliminate environmentally unsound, low-stack coal-fired boilers; and strengthen the maintenance function; and b) institutional support for policy reform, project implementation and enterprise restructuring for project agencies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Latvia!$!LV","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"14,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"LV","sectorcode":"LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,81,84,30,73","mjthemecode":"9,2,11,11,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01032006473089","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032006473089","DocDate":"28-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200191194","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200191194","DocDate":"18-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200191093","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200191093","DocDate":"18-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200191194","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200191194","DocURL":"18-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200191093","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200191093","DocURL":"18-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052811225907","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052811225907","DocDate":"05-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3c52_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3c52_1_0","DocDate":"23-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3c50_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3c50_1_0","DocDate":"23-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019100339","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019100339","DocDate":"25-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052811214006","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052811214006","DocDate":"09-FEB-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Latvia"}},"facets":{}}
