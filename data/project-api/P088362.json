The development objectives of the proposed project are threefold in support of the National Action Plan for the control of Avian Influenza Epidemic: (a) to strengthen disease surveillance and diagnostic capacity in the control of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI); (b) to strengthen the poultry sector infrastructure to better cope with serious disease outbreaks; and (c) to safeguard human health by improving public awareness and information. The above objectives should be viewed as the first phase of a longer-term program aimed at restructuring Vietnam's poultry sub-sector and strengthening the veterinary services system to deal with other potentially destructive infectious disease outbreaks. The proposed project would therefore serve as a pioneering effort to evaluate the methodologies most suitable for emergency preparedness and longer-term intervention."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"AB,AJ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,64,75","mjthemecode":"10,8,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":30},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080829004029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080829004029","DocDate":"19-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2005011412310255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2005011412310255","DocDate":"27-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2005011412310255","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2005011412310255","DocURL":"27-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000090341_20040713132718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040713132718","DocDate":"02-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20040630100119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040630100119","DocDate":"29-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20040701093133","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040701093133","DocDate":"28-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20040514093859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040514093859","DocDate":"11-MAY-2004"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}},"facets":{}}
