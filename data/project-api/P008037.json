The project will also help reduce the role of the public sector in irrigation. There will be five components to the project: a) rehabilitation of the infrastructure for approximately 25 irrigation schemes, estimated to cover and area of over 200,000 hectares and reach over 50,000 families; b) institutional development and strengthening of water users' organizations and training of their management in administration, finance, and operation and maintenance; c) an incentive program for technology improvement, including a training program for private technicians, extensionists and farmers in irrigation techniques and practices, fertilization, and pesticide management as well as a matching grant program to encourage the adoption of modern irrigation technology; d) project administration and monitoring; and e) an emergency dam safety program to deal with immediate hazards which significantly affect large numbers of water users along the coast."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto por subsector para la irrigaci\u00f3n</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"85,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Brief,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"BC,AB,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,78,77","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":90},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333038_20081031001532","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081031001532","DocDate":"01-OCT-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2006021617071544","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006021617071544","DocURL":"28-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2006021617071544","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006021617071544","DocDate":"28-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050110094040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050110094040","DocDate":"20-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200264397","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200264397","DocURL":"07-NOV-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200264095","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200264095","DocURL":"07-NOV-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200264498","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200264498","DocURL":"07-NOV-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019102251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019102251","DocDate":"27-JUN-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
