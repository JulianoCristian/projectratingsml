It would provide year-round irrigation for about 200,000 acres in the Mandalay Division in Upper Burma. About 88,000 acres of this area are under an existing irrigation system which is only capable of providing irrigation for one crop during the monsoon season. With the construction of the proposed Nyaunggyat Dam, and the flood control works, the project area would receive assured water supplies for irrigation, allowing double cropping. To help achieve this, the project provides for the rehabilitation of the existing inefficient and silted-up irrigation system and construction of new irrigation and drainage facilities in the new areas. Complementary measures include on-farm development, improved water management, agriculture extension and research, farm mechanization, technical assistance, and training. The project would also provide for hydroelectric power generation with a maximum generating capacity of 56 MW and an average annual energy production of 165 GWh. The project would benefit about 33,000 farm families, double the utilization of family labor and increase hired labor requirements by about 38%."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar!$!MM","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MM","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925040619","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925040619","DocDate":"08-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902353029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902353029","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912481842","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912481842","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar"}},"facets":{}}
