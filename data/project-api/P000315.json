The project would provide for doubling of water supply facilities in the two cities which are at present unable to meet demand the dry season. The Douala sub-project provides for expansion of production facilities, and additional reservoirs and distribution lines. At Yaounde the project would include the construction of an earth dam creating a reservoir of 5 million cubic meters capacity, a new treatment plant and pumping station and a transmission main to carry the water to the city, as well as additional storage and distribution facilities. The project is expected to be completed in two years."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cameroon!$!CM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CM","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67e5a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67e5a_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAY-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67e59_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67e59_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAY-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903130993","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903130993","DocDate":"30-APR-1969"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cameroon"}},"facets":{}}
