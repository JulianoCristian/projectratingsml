Specific objectives are to: (1) improve natural resource management and conservation by community and ejido forestry resource owners; and (2) increase the range of forestry-based income generating options available to them. The project will have four components: (1)To assist Oaxaca's communities and ejidos (land grants for legal use and enjoyment that, prior to 1992 constitutional reforms, were state-owned and could not be sold) by financing activities, assistance, and training to prepare and update management plans for timber extraction; to prepare conservation plans for forested areas; to integrate resource management and forestry research; to develop silvicultural skills, and control fire and insects; to understand boundary conflict issues; to access credit, markets, and technologies; to increase the efficiency of forestry activities and enterprises, and to improve business and management, especially financial management skills. (2) To strengthen the capacity of Oaxaca's private service providers to assist communities and ejidos, and finance consultants and equipment needed to review and strengthen the government's certification and evaluation program for private sector providers. (3) To promote non-timber forest products in the six priority states with pine-oak forest by financing studies, grants, salaries, consultants, equipment, materials, and publications. (4) providing finance to strengthen state forestry institutions in five priority states with pine-oak forest."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":29},"theme1":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"AB,BC,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,57,86","mjthemecode":"11,7,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":42},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":29},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":29}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100802024239","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100802024239","DocDate":"28-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040701131519","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040701131519","DocDate":"29-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185458","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185458","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123131403","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123131403","DocURL":"02-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123131101","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123131101","DocURL":"02-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123130900","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123130900","DocURL":"02-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123131302","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123131302","DocURL":"02-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625093529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625093529","DocDate":"21-JAN-1997"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
