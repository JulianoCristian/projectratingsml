Policy reforms supported by this operation will focus on the following pillars: i) strengthening national coordination and regulation; ii) strengthening intra-island connectivity; iii) improving inter-island connectivity; and iv) improving International connectivity (trade facilitation). The DPL to Indonesia for US$100 million is designed to assist the Government of Indonesia (GoI) to strengthen the policy framework for improved national trade logistics, transportation, and ICT and trade facilitation. In developing the operation, the Bank and the Government considered several design alternatives, including the possibility of supporting such reforms through a single multisectoral DPL. The overall focus of the INSTANSI DPL, Connectivity DPL and Financial Sector and Investment Climate Reform and Modernization Development Policy Loan (FIRM DPL) is consistent with the World Bank's Development Policy Review (2008), and they are fully aligned with the 2009-2012 Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR). The connectivity DPL is expected to further enhance coordination and implementation of GoI reforms in the connectivity agenda, which is critical for accelerating growth to 7 percent and beyond, and continuing improvements in social outcomes over the medium term."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":44},"sector2":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":8},"sector5":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":31},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":43},"theme3":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Program Document,Loan Agreement,Summary of Discussion,Letter of Development Policy","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"LZ,WZ,JA,CT,TZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,47,39,49","mjthemecode":"5,4,5,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":44},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":31},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":9},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":8},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000386194_20121214010438","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121214010438","DocDate":"06-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b0817e7407_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0817e7407_1_0","DocDate":"23-NOV-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000333037_20121130002038","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20121130002038","DocDate":"20-NOV-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Letter of Development Policy (DPL),  Vol.","DocType":"DPL","EntityID":"090224b081ce8f9c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ce8f9c_1_0","DocDate":"05-OCT-2012"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
