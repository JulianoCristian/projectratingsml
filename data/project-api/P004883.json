If approved, the loan would be the Bank's first direct industrial operation since lending was resumed in FY1973. The prime purpose of the Bank loan lies not so much in its financial contribution of somewhat more than 20 percent of estimated project costs as in its effort at institution building in Algeria's building material sector. The project attempts to help SNMC cope with present and future organizational and financial problems created by an ambitious investment program which, between 1974 and 1980, is expected to require fixed asset expenditures in excess of US$2.0 billion and which aims at making Algeria independent in cement and some other building materials by the end of this decade. To this end, cement production is expected to increase from about 1.5 million tons in 1975 to about 8.0 million tons by 1980."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"46,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101929","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101929","DocDate":"19-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e72433_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e72433_1_0","DocDate":"16-DEC-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e72432_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e72432_1_0","DocDate":"16-DEC-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902251627","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902251627","DocDate":"30-NOV-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100211023424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100211023424","DocDate":"25-NOV-1975"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
