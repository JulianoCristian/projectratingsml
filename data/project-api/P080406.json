The project will support HIV/AIDS-related health sector, human resource capacity building in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania using a \"training-of-trainers\" (TOT) model. It is expected that, as a result of increased capacity in the sub-region, this project will contribute to enhanced delivery of HIV/AIDS-related services, stronger linkages between prevention and care interventions, and expanded South-South partnerships. In Tanzania, the project components will: 1) support the implementation of short-term (non-diploma) training courses for health care practitioners at various levels, including physicians, nurses, counselor supervisors, laboratory technicians, and HIV/AIDS program managers, based on the training-of trainers (TOT) approach, maximizing the impact of this capacity-building project; 2) prioritize on monitoring and evaluation (M&E), enabling knowledge sharing, and lessons application to strengthening the program. Routine dissemination of HIV/AIDS-related program information will also be financed, to ensure greater knowledge sharing between, and within counties. The project will explore options for distance learning, to maximize resources, and to ensure a broader regional approach for sharing experiences and enhancing skills; and, 3) support strong coordination, and capacity building between the project counties, and their governing agencies. A major focus of this component would involve providing the Project Coordination Unit with support to administrative, fiduciary, and technical responsibilities."},"country_namecode":"Africa!$!3A","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"3A","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"88","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":85},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20110502005001","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110502005001","DocDate":"01-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000014464_2005020811290871","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2005020811290871","DocDate":"03-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"0000A0035_2010042214340660","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A0035_2010042214340660","DocDate":"25-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20040907095837","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040907095837","DocDate":"19-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20040623141444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040623141444","DocDate":"23-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03012304092237","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03012304092237","DocDate":"27-JAN-2003"}],"countryname":"Africa","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
