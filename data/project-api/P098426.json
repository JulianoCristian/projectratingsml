This restructuring will bring the following changes: (i) extend the closing date of the project from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 (resulting in a cumulative extension of almost 3 years from the original closing date of January 15, 2012). This extension will assist the General Department of Taxation (GDT) in rolling out the system after development is completed (expected by January 2014); and (ii) minor reallocation of the expenditure
