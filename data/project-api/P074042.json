The restructuring will: a) extend the project closing date by 18 months from December 15, 2009 to June 15, 2011 thereby allowing the Lebanese Government additional time to fully implement the project and meet the project development objectives (PDO's) in full and; b) better capture the outcomes and outputs of the project, through a revised results framework."},"country_namecode":"Lebanese
