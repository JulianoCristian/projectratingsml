Each subproject consists of portions of the 1982 to 1986 investment program of the five state utility companies selected by ELETROBRAS as beneficiaries of the proposed loan. These utilities are small to medium size companies located in the less developed regions of Brazil. The objectives of their programs are to meet the needs of the market efficiently and to remedy unsatisfactory conditions arising from inadequate planning and lack of sufficient investment during preceeding years. Their programs provide for the purchase and installation of equipment, consultant services and the formulation of plans that give emphasis to the connection of rural and low-income consumers. The project will substantially strengthen the operations of ELETROBRAS, especially its project selection, appraisal and supervision capability. In addition it will provide institutional support and strengthening to the beneficiaries."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"182,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e973cc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e973cc_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAY-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e973cb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e973cb_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAY-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902393435","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902393435","DocDate":"30-APR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912532274","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912532274","DocDate":"30-APR-1982"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
