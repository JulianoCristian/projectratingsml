To achive this, the project creates infrastructure and income opportunities for the rural poor; empowers active groups of disadavanteged people; and supports village governments in becoming more responsive and effective in assisting them. There are two main project components. Component 1 focuses on six main activities: 1) human resource development for project stakeholders to build skills and change behavior through orientation, reward, and performance appraisal, and supply-driven and demand-driven training; 2) strengthening of \"panchayats\" to develop training programs; 3) formation and strengthening of organizations to recruit and build the capacity of nongovernmental organizations and project facilitation teams; 4) communication and information to ensure that the project and its rules are disseminated to all target beneficiaries appropriately; 5) monitoring and learning and special studies to support information gathering; and 6) project administration. Component 2 comprises community investments, including matching grants for community invrstments, matching grants for \"panchayat plans, village funds that are entirely financed by community contributions and that finance operation and maintenance of village infrastructure, and innovation funds."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":23},"theme5":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"112,560,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Indigenous Peoples Plan,Indigenous Peoples Plan","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"JB,BH,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"60,77,78,57,56","mjthemecode":"6,7,10,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20110728011903","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20110728011903","DocDate":"21-APR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02103104330541","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02103104330541","DocDate":"24-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03042404010024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03042404010024","DocDate":"24-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02121704045895","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02121704045895","DocDate":"21-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02122404053762","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02122404053762","DocDate":"13-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.2","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000094946_0305200407139","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0305200407139","DocDate":"01-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000094946_02122404053764","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02122404053764","DocDate":"23-NOV-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
