The changes will support a faster realization of the project development objective, enhanced response to the current needs of the country's investment climate improvement, export development and diversification, and efficient utilization of the undisturbed balance of the IDA Credit and Grant. The restructuring measures to: (i) strengthen the support provided under the project for the investment climate reforms, which have become a prominent priority for the Government and the private sector; (ii) expand the support to the Ministry of Energy and Mining for management of the mining sub-sector by providing assistance for capacity enhancement and transparency strengthening, as the Government views the mining sector as a major pillar of its economic diversification; (iii) refocus the content of the enterprise development activities with a particular emphasis on support to export-oriented firms and micro-entrepreneurs through the \"Maison de l 'Entreprise du Burkina Faso\" (MEBF); (iv) reduce the scope of some activities that are no longer as relevant as originally envisioned; and (v) strengthen the implementation arrangements by introducing a steering committee that will oversee the activities of the coordination unit and ensure that all interested stakeholders are adequately involved in the project operations."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Other
