The project provides flood control and drainage for a priority area of about 170,000 ha.  Principal investments consist of dikes, bypass channels, and secondary drainage systems, rural roads, bridges and various control and conveyance structures.  It includes an Agricultural Development Plan (PDA) aimed at supporting and improving smallholder production systems and provides for environmental protection and conservation within the project area and in its close vicinity.  It includes an institutional strengthening component for the Commission for the Development of the Guayas River Basin (CEDEGE) and for agencies participating in agricultural development and environmental intitiatives.  It also provides for a monitoring and evaluation process, a mid-term review and recommendations, additional studies, and possible follow-up projects, as well as financing for a master plan for the entire Lower Guayas Basin that delineates a sound development strategy for the area's natural and human resources."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"59,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Flood protection"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"BC,AB,WD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,52","mjthemecode":"6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":50},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01020605302344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01020605302344","DocDate":"15-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042608381704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042608381704","DocDate":"11-NOV-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062114554105","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062114554105","DocDate":"12-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042608361603","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042608361603","DocDate":"16-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032215493706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032215493706","DocDate":"08-MAR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042210010607","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042210010607","DocDate":"08-MAR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929133830","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929133830","DocDate":"13-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929133631","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929133631","DocDate":"13-NOV-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
