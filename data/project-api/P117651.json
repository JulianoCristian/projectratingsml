The ESES DPL2 is grounded in the development goals articulated in Turkey's ninth development plan. It supports the governments policies for long-term sustainable growth across the economy and in the energy sector in particular. The ESES DPL2 program continues to support the government program for energy security, energy efficiency, and clean energy first supported under the 2009 Programmatic Electricity Development Policy Loan (PEDPL). At the request of the government, it also includes policies, strategies and specific measures related to climate change and environmental management. The government has concluded the energy efficiency, energuy security, and environmental issues are most effectively addressed in an integrated program. By supporting the government broader sustainable development agenda, the bank scales up its engagement with Turkey on the environment and climate change."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Solid waste management","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":10},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"700,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Solid waste management"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"WB,AT,LA,WZ,LT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,39,82,81","mjthemecode":"11,11,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Solid waste management","code":"WB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":40},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":30},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":10},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000461832_20140212103515","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000461832_20140212103515","DocDate":"23-DEC-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011011117114920","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011011117114920","DocDate":"11-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010081813473585","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010081813473585","DocDate":"01-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20100525025623","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100525025623","DocDate":"14-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000020953_20100303100016","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20100303100016","DocDate":"10-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20091211093304","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20091211093304","DocDate":"10-DEC-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
