Human resources play a critical role in Jordan's economy.  Lacking natural endowments and relying heavily on imports, the country's prosperity depends on human capital earnings.  Since the mid 1980's, Jordan has been losing its comparative advantage in these two areas owing to changing macroeconomic conditions and the qualitative shortcomings of its education system.  The Government recognizes its need to raise the quality of basic and secondary education so as to develop its domestic technological capacity, and maintain its regional comparative advantage in terms of labor services.  It has therefore formulated an education reform program to be implemented in three phases which includes: (a) restructuring the school system; (b) improving the quality of teaching and learning; (c) using sector resources more efficiently and increasing cost recovery levels; and (d) institutionalizing the capacity to sustain sectoral reform."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"73,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"}],"docty":"Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"JO","sectorcode":"EC,ES,EV,ET,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"65,66","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042817434008","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042817434008","DocDate":"20-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042817393169","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042817393169","DocDate":"31-JAN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040711501609","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040711501609","DocDate":"18-AUG-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927221735","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927221735","DocDate":"22-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927221605","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927221605","DocDate":"22-MAY-1989"}],"countryname":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan"}},"facets":{}}
