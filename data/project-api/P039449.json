There are six components in this project. First, Policy and Institutional Development will support the introduction and strengthening of key policy and administrative reforms in allocation of students and finance; administration of higher education; teaching programs; tuition charges and student loans; and private higher education. Second, Higher Education Institutes Investment Program will reduce costs by consolidating single-purpose institutions into multi-faculty colleges and universities. Third, Management Information System will finance development of strategy and process redesign; software development; upgrading of information technology networks; and training. Fourth, Management Capacity Development will support increased management capacity in planning, financial management, information systems, academic reform, and policy analysis. Fifth, Student Loan Program will develop a loan program based on a state guarantee of repayment. Sixth, Project Management and Project Preparation Facility will finance the establishment and operation of the Project Management Unit."},"country_namecode":"Hungary!$!HU","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":22},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HU","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,66,25","mjthemecode":"2,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":78},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":22}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01120404004483","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01120404004483","DocDate":"08-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200353869","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200353869","DocURL":"04-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052510505669","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052510505669","DocDate":"04-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980312102327","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980312102327","DocDate":"30-JAN-1998"}],"countryname":"Hungary"}},"facets":{}}
