The project consists of two components: the sector restructuring component and the physical investment component. Restructuring will be implemented in two phases. The first phase involves providing technical assistance to help the Government and TCC prepare proposals for a new sector policy and a draft Telecommunication Law. This will lead to further development of the sector and will facilitate opening up new possibilities for the private sector. The physical component is tailored to increase infrastructure capacity and it represents a compilation of several sub-projects comprising provision and installation of local infrastructure for telephone service."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition
