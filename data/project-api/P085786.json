The Project will have two components: 1. National Village Fund (NVF): The NVF component creates rules for communities to: (a) access resources that can stimulate economic activities and allow poor households to increase their incomes; (b) reduce vulnerability by empowering them with more instruments for insuring against the risks they face; and (c) improve access and use of social services. Thus, the Project provides a multi-sectoral response to the needs of communities whose actions will better prepare them to take advantage of market-created opportunities as well as use resources made available from or through Government. 2. Capacity Enhancement: Under this component, communities and sectors (represented  ward and district/municipal levels) will be enabled to undertake activities that assist Tanzania meet its targets as laid out in the PRS (in health, education, water and sanitation, savings mobilization, incomes for the poor, tackling vulnerability, and increasing access to the market by the poor) by mobilizing both informal and formal mechanisms for responding to shocks."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary
