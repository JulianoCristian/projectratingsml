The Project has three components: Component 1 - Development of tertiary treatment (nutrient removal) at the North Budapest wastewater treatment plant; Component 2 - Wetland restoration in the Gemenc and Beda-Karapancsa areas of the Duna-Drava National Park and establishment of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system or the evaluation of Project impacts in terms of reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus; and Component 3 - Dissemination activities to foster replication in Hungary or in other parts of the Danube River
