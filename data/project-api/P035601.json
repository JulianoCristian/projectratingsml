Its overall objectives are to advance the onset of fertility decline by increasing the use of modern methods of contraception, and slow the spread of HIV infection by promoting behavioral change. To attain these objectives, the project will support policies and investments designed to: 1) reinforce the national capacity to implement the national population policy by a) strengthening the national capacity for undertaking population-related activities; b) implementing a community awareness program and dissemination of the population policy; and c) supporting population-related research; 2) strengthening the national capacity to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS/STDs by: a) institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Public Health; and b) supporting epidemiological, operational, and socio-economic research; 3) putting in place a social marketing program for the promotion of condoms; and 4) promoting the participation of the private sector and NGOs in population, FP, and HIV/AIDS/STD programs by setting up a social fund."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":62},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"20,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TD","sectorcode":"BC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"69,57,88","mjthemecode":"8,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":62},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000310607_20061228161619","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20061228161619","DocDate":"07-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000112742_20050317110557","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050317110557","DocDate":"07-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02071004024262","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071004024262","DocDate":"12-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123353245","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123353245","DocURL":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123353245","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123353245","DocDate":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b49d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b49d_1_0","DocDate":"23-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007234415","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007234415","DocDate":"03-MAR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chad"}},"facets":{}}
