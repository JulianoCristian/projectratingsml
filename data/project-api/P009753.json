The project would also develop WSSB as an institution capable of planning and implementing sectoral development programs in Punjab. Separate water supply and sewerage departments established within MCs would be strengthened to ensure that systems constructed under the project would be operated efficiently. The needs of the urban poor would be met through the free supply of water from standpipes. Credit would also be provided on easy terms to facilitate service connections by the economically weaker sections of society."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"38,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924182925","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924182925","DocDate":"16-SEP-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd009_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd009_1_0","DocDate":"12-SEP-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c30_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c30_1_0","DocDate":"12-SEP-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c2f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c2f_1_0","DocDate":"12-SEP-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c2e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c2e_1_0","DocDate":"12-SEP-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912375883","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912375883","DocDate":"31-AUG-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902303556","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902303556","DocDate":"31-AUG-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
