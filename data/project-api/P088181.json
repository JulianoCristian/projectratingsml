The program will continue to focus on the same thematic areas supported by preceding operations, with the proposed addition of infrastructure --in particular, of roads, water, and electricity-- under the service delivery component. Therefore, the program will support the long-term improvement of the supply side of the economy by strengthening service delivery in the human development and infrastructure areas while also providing a short-term stimulus to the demand side. The program's focus on governance, moreover, will strengthen the institutional framework and external accountability mechanisms that are essential to growth and poverty-reduction. The program will follow four principles of engagement, which are consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy for Timor-Leste: deepening the results orientation, fostering transparency and communications, building institutional capacity, and strengthening partnerships."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!$!TP","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":29},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":14},"sector5":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rule of law","Percent":16},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Program Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Program Information Document","countrycode":"TP","sectorcode":"YZ,LT,EP,BG,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Rule of law","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"25,37,65,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8,3,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Other rule of law","code":"37"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":29},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":29},{"Name":"Education","Percent":14},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":14},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080808012030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080808012030","DocDate":"26-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000014464_2006040714051406","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006040714051406","DocDate":"12-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2006040714051406","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006040714051406","DocURL":"12-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000090341_20050920125211","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050920125211","DocDate":"07-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"005824597_2005052518051797","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005824597_2005052518051797","DocURL":"25-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"005807045_2005051716330745","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005807045_2005051716330745","DocURL":"10-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050407093706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050407093706","DocDate":"06-APR-2005"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
