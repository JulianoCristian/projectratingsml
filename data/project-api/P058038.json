The project has three main components. The first, promotion of input use and distribution systems, includes farmer access to seasonal credit for modern farm inputs; advisory services for the adoption of modern farm inputs; and access to credit, multiplication, and distribution of improved seeds. The second, support to local agricultural marketing systems, is comprised of crop conservation, processing, and marketing technologies; strengthening of rural agricultural marketing poles; and support to private trader investment in marketing services. The final component consists of technical support, monitoring, and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":39},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"BC,FE,YA,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,78,79,75","mjthemecode":"10,10,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":39},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":31},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040630105625","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040630105625","DocDate":"28-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99072307564741","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99072307564741","DocDate":"01-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99062306380953","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99062306380953","DocDate":"08-JUN-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda"}},"facets":{}}
