It will support productive investments, and improved farming practices, and will further improve the ability of the Trust Fund for Shared Risk (FIRCO), in the transformation of those technologies, for the benefit of the agriculture sector. The components include: a) a promotion campaign targeting renewable energy for agricultural productive purposes, and, training to technicians, agricultural extension experts, and energy system vendors, will be provided. Technical specifications and certification procedures will be introduced for farm-based energy equipment, and market studies will focus on the potential for agricultural applications; b) installation of solar and wind-powered water pumping systems, and solar-powered refrigerated milk storage tanks, for participating farmers as demonstration units; c) technical assistance, which will be provided by renewable energy-trained agricultural extension experts, to advise farmers on the new energy operation procedures; d) a pilot program will test innovative vendor financing mechanisms for farm-based energy systems in four states; and, e) project management will be implemented and coordinated by FIRCO."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"sector3":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"8,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Renewable energy"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Animal production"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"AJ,BC,LE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,82,81,78","mjthemecode":"10,11,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20070215101555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20070215101555","DocDate":"29-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042911453222","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042911453222","DocDate":"14-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060212213223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060212213223","DocDate":"26-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99120905323943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99120905323943","DocDate":"24-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99092905334655","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99092905334655","DocDate":"14-SEP-1999"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
