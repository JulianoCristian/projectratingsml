The objectives of the project include:  (a) improving and extending sewerage service to 70 percent of the population of Istanbul by the end of 1994; (b) providing for appropriate disposal of sewage to protect the waters and shorelines of the Sea of Marmara and the Bosphorus; and (c) reducing unaccounted-for water.  Finally, the project hopes to (d) strengthen ISKI's operation and maintenance and industrial waste management capabilities.  To that end, the project includes rehabilitation of parts of the water distribution system; installation of a system for water supply monitoring and control; and construction of sewage collection and sewage treatment facilities.  A technical assistance component of the project would provide advice and training to strengthen ISKI institutionally."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":24},"sector2":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":76},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"218,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sewerage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"WS,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,85,84,73","mjthemecode":"9,11,11,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":24},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":76}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000178830_98111703552490","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703552490","DocDate":"22-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926121902","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926121902","DocDate":"02-NOV-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926121811","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926121811","DocDate":"02-NOV-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
