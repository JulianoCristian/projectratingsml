It is thus a key component of the Bank's program of re-engagement in Haiti, as described in the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS). Technical assistance (TA) for the implementation of the economic governance reform supported by the EGRO will be provided by the Bank through a recently approved Low Income Countries under Stress (LICUS) grant, and a technical assistance IDA project. The EGRO supports reform measures in the following main areas: fiscal management, budget processes and financial control; public sector procurement; anti-corruption strategy; human resource management; efficiency and transparency in the management of public enterprises, and road maintenance; public-private partnerships, and governance in the education and health sectors; civil society monitoring of economic governance reforms; and, enhanced public information system. Nevertheless, in addition to the political, and security risks faced by the country, two critical risks are: 1) weak institutional capacity; and, 2) the short time framework for implementation of the reforms supported by the EGRO. Since the transition period may prove too short to allow for lasting reforms in the civil service, the donor community has responded with proposed significant technical assistance, and efforts to coordinate it effectively. And, by supporting capacity building efforts, the proposed operation would also contribute to increasing the national absorptive capacity and therefore a faster disbursement of badly needed external assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Haiti!$!HT","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Power","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":4},"sector5":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"61,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"HT","sectorcode":"WZ,CT,LD,TZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Human development","Public sector governance","Economic management"],"themecode":"23,27,70,29,30","mjthemecode":"2,2,8,2,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":75},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":12},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":5},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":4},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000011823_20061218120504","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000011823_20061218120504","DocDate":"25-OCT-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000090341_20060320090856","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060320090856","DocDate":"17-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010031114055933","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031114055933","DocURL":"06-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010031114055933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031114055933","DocDate":"06-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000014464_2010043010595337","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010043010595337","DocDate":"06-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20041215094549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041215094549","DocDate":"10-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20041129135119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20041129135119","DocDate":"23-NOV-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Haiti"}},"facets":{}}
