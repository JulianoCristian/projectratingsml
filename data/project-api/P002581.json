The project, situated on both sides of the Blue Nile river from about 30 kms upstream of Singa to Sennar, will cover 52,500 feddans and about 50,000 feddans respectively inside and outside the Shasheina Region. The project will improve levels of productivity, particularly for cotton (in both regions), sorghum, groundnuts and vegetables, and introduce fodder crop for livestock (in Shasheina only). As a result, cotton exports will be increased, incomes for the BNAC and the tenants will rise and the schemes will once again be placed on a sound management and financial footing. This will be achieved through provision of: (i) agricultural machinery, equipment and spare parts; (ii) new pumphouses and improved irrigation distribution systems; (iii) buildings for administration, workshops and staff housing; (iv) operating vehicles and a telecommunications network; (v) service roads and potable water supply; and (vi) technical assistance and consultancy services for strengthening management for project implementation and operation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Sudan!$!SD","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SD","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925035959","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925035959","DocDate":"22-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925053319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925053319","DocDate":"17-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902370313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902370313","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e041e4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e041e4_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e041e2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e041e2_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912510144","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912510144","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Sudan"}},"facets":{}}
