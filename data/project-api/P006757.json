The project is an unusually low-cost power development, as large dams are unnecessary. The Mesitas facility would meet about 95% of projected incremental energy demand in the EEEB system during 1982-84, including that attributable to 70,000 new subscribers to be connected annual over this period. Improvement of EEEB's structure of tariffs and rates would be a major institutional focus of the proposed loan. The project is subject to the risks normally associated with underground civil works under difficult geological conditions. However, the actions that have been taken to minimize risk should ensure that the project will be carried out as scheduled."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"84,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902314676","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902314676","DocDate":"30-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912401387","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912401387","DocDate":"30-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3a7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3a7_1_0","DocDate":"14-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3a6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3a6_1_0","DocDate":"14-NOV-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
