The project is the first of a series of large-scale, fully mechanized coal mining operations in the country. It will contribute to: (a) increasing coal production by about 4.5 mtpy by the early 1990s; (b) transferring technology in mine design, engineering and construction (especially the highly productive, mechanized longwall exploitation technology); (c) introducing modern coal washing technology; and (d) fostering improved management techniques for project scheduling, monitoring and cost control. The project will finance: (a) construction of the Changcun mine, including vertical shafts, underground roadways, and longwall faces; (b) construction of a coal preparation plant; (c) equipment for coal extraction, washery and loadout operations; and (d) surface infrastructure including a railway spur line, an electrical substation, water supply lines, workshops, and warehouses."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u5e38\u6751\u7164\u70ad\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u52302000\u5e74\u5e74\u5e95\u524d\u7164\u70ad\u5e74\u4ea7\u91cf\u7ffb\u756a\uff08\u8fbe\u523012\u4ebf\u5428\uff09\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5373\u662f\u8be5\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u91cd\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u62e5\u6709\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5927\u578b\u7164\u70ad\u7efc\u91c7\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5373\u662f\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\uff1a\uff081\uff09\uff08\u4e8c\u5341\u4e16\u7eaa\uff09\u4e5d\u5341\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u671f\u4e4b\u524d\u7164\u70ad\u4ea7\u91cf\u6bcf\u5e74\u589e\u957f\u7ea6450\u4e07\u5428\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u8f6c\u8ba9\u7164\u77ff\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u65bd\u5de5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u751f\u4ea7\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7efc\u91c7\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u957f\u58c1\u5f00\u91c7\u6280\u672f\uff09\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5f15\u8fdb\u73b0\u4ee3\u6d17\u7164\u6280\u672f\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u57f9\u80b2\u9879\u76ee\u8ba1\u5212\u5236\u5b9a\u3001\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u6210\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u826f\u597d\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u8d44\u52a9\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5185\u5bb9\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5efa\u8bbe\u5e38\u6751\u7164\u77ff\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ad6\u4e95\u3001\u5730\u4e0b\u901a\u9053\u548c\u957f\u58c1\u7efc\u91c7\u5de5\u4f5c\u9762\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5efa\u8bbe\u4e00\u5bb6\u9009\u7164\u5382\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u7164\u70ad\u5f00\u91c7\u3001\u6e05\u6d17\u548c\u5916\u8fd0\u8bbe\u5907\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u5efa\u8bbe\u5730\u9762\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u6761\u94c1\u8def\u652f\u7ebf\u3001\u4e00\u5ea7\u53d8\u7535\u7ad9\u3001\u4f9b\u6c34\u7ba1\u7ebf\u3001\u8f66\u95f4\u548c\u4ed3\u5e93\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"126,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"NN","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining","code":"NX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","code":"NN"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007023519","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007023519","DocDate":"02-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135656","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135656","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904163119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904163119","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
