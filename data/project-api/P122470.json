Mozambique's economic performance for the past decade has been very strong and the government has been implementing an active program of structural reforms. Following political stabilization and market-oriented reforms, and steady improvements in infrastructure, the economy has registered an average annual growth rate of 8 percent between 1993 and 2009, and incomes have risen considerably. There is a very strong momentum for continuing the reforms program and striving to reach even higher growth rates. However, economic growth has also been negatively affected by the financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, and there are now fewer public and private financial resources available to finance investments. The economic policies that have served well Mozambique in the past and have contributed to strong economic growth have started to show some signs of fatigue. The PRSC series is an important component of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) approved by the Board in 2007, and closely aligned to the government program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":16},"theme2":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"85,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"AZ,YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"27,45,42,83","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,4,5,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":33},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20130725111021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130725111021","DocDate":"12-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"090224b081af6a36_3_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081af6a36_3_0","DocDate":"17-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20101124014237","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20101124014237","DocDate":"17-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20101105150606","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20101105150606","DocDate":"05-NOV-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
