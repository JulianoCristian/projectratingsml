The project is the first phase of a long-term national program to support the development of SROs.  The project finances equipment, vehicles and operating costs associated with preparation/appraisal/execution of SROs and improvement of extension services; training and technical assistance; and investments such as bottomland improvements, small irrigated perimeters, soil conservation, watershed management and social forestry including village tree nurseries and studies.  Beneficiary farmer groups would contribute part of the investment costs, bear all operating costs and accumulate savings to replace renewable assets such as pumps.  The most important benefit of the project would be the development of an institutional capability in Niger to make sound investment decisions for SROs and manage investment funds."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Niger!$!NE","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"9,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NE","sectorcode":"BH,BC,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"79,78","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":55},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99031910581029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910581029","DocDate":"10-FEB-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120360414","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120360414","DocURL":"14-SEP-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120360113","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120360113","DocDate":"14-SEP-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120355912","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120355912","DocURL":"14-SEP-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120360113","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120360113","DocURL":"14-SEP-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120360414","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120360414","DocDate":"14-SEP-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120355912","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120355912","DocDate":"14-SEP-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07ec7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07ec7_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926182452","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926182452","DocDate":"22-FEB-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Niger","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
