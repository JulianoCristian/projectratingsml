The project will support about 140 local communities in their efforts in constructing new senior secondary schools in educationally underserved rural areas.  Classrooms, laboratories, libraries, staff facilities and houses will be constructed in time for January 1992 and January 1993 intakes, creating a total of more than 18,000 new student places.  In addition, library books will be provided in sufficient quantities for the school library to serve the local community as well as students and staff. Finally, a truck will be given to those schools that construct or provide hygienic toilets with their own resources."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"14,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,71,78","mjthemecode":"10,9,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019181135","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019181135","DocDate":"20-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121035150","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121035150","DocURL":"08-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121035150","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121035150","DocDate":"08-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121035351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121035351","DocDate":"08-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121035351","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121035351","DocURL":"08-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e3931e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3931e_1_0","DocDate":"25-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001045926","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001045926","DocDate":"31-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001045724","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001045724","DocDate":"29-MAY-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
