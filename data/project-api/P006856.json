It is part of Fondo Nacional de Caminos Vecinales (FNCV) 1990-1993 Investment and Maintenance Program. The main components are: (a) maintenance, including resurfacing works on roads; (b) improvement of civil works along existing dry-weather roads, including completion of bridges and drainage structures; (c) construction of civil works for rural roads; (d) studies, including the review of road-funding strategies and engineering designs, and supervision of civil works; (e) spare parts to rehabilitate and operate maintenance equipment; and (f) training, technical assistance and other services. The project will directly benefit the rural population and production by improving access to social and market services and lowering farmers' and consumer's transport costs. Equally important, it will facilitate the decentralization process in the roads sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"55,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,78,75","mjthemecode":"10,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170757","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170757","DocDate":"20-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041914511782","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041914511782","DocDate":"07-MAR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032214363083","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032214363083","DocDate":"07-MAR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171537","DocDate":"30-DEC-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171308","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171308","DocDate":"30-DEC-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
