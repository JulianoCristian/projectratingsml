The components are : 1) Cultural and institutional strengthening, and capacity building of participating communities, which consists of a) generation and strengthening of the organizational, technical and administrative capacities of indigenous communities regarding the application of their cultural values to the management of their natural resources; b) standardization and criteria formation for traditional ecosystem management of indigenous communities, including a certification process for them to engage in effective ecosystem management, and; c) strengthening empowerment capacities of community organizations for traditional ecosystem management. 2) Promotion of sustainable cultural land use and traditional ecosystem management entails the development of a progressive series of community conservation, and sustainable cultural land use plans that together can form a network of land use areas, to yield greater collective conservation impacts, actually focused on actual planning and management of conservation areas. 3) Development of culturally appropriate products, markets, and services for environmental sustainability in indigenous communities will channel grant
