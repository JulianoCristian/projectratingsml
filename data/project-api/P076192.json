The Credit supports the restoration of assets and production levels immediately after the civil disturbances that seriously disrupted the Borrower's economy during 2001 by providing immediate financing for a positive list of imports identified as necessary to an effective recovery program while supporting macroeconomic objectives by providing financing for the budget. It also encourages resource mobilization from the donor community as a whole by setting an example of rapid assistance. While this type of operation does not include conditionality linked to macroeconomic policies, IDA/Bank monitoring of economic developments and close collaboration with the IMF will help ensure adequate macroeconomic and fiscal diligence on the part of the Government."},"country_namecode":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of!$!MK","sector1":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Petrochemicals and fertilizers","Percent":33},"theme1":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Petrochemicals and fertilizers"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MK","sectorcode":"YD,YB,YW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Economic management","Economic management"],"themecode":"23,21,58","mjthemecode":"7,1,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Petrochemicals and fertilizers","code":"YD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":34},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":33},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":33}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030708123657","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030708123657","DocDate":"03-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201261841","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201261841","DocURL":"18-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201261841","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201261841","DocDate":"18-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_01120404004587","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01120404004587","DocDate":"20-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01101904282414","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01101904282414","DocDate":"02-OCT-2001"}],"countryname":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of"}},"facets":{}}
