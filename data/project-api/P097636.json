This proposed credit will complete the series of annual programmatic development policy credits (DPC) in support of PESRP. Phase II of PESRP is being prepared by the Punjab Government, and the Bank has been requested to support it through a new series of annual DPCs. Key pillars of the PESRP are: (A) public finance reforms to increase public spending for education (and other pro-poor services) and to ensure fiscal sustainability; (B) reforms that strengthen devolution and improve the fiduciary environment and governance; and (C) education sector reforms to improve quality, access, and sector governance. There has been steady progress during the past two years, and the Program is showing improvements in enrolment and in reducing the gender gap at the primary and middle school levels. The proposed third credit will assist the Government in completing the agreed reform framework."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":40},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"BH,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,26,65,59,27","mjthemecode":"2,7,8,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":60},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080307013641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080307013641","DocDate":"31-JUL-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"006881420_2006073116022120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006881420_2006073116022120","DocDate":"05-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"006881420_2006073116022120","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006881420_2006073116022120","DocURL":"05-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000020953_20070206120111","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070206120111","DocDate":"28-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20060424102125","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20060424102125","DocDate":"12-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20051220105453","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20051220105453","DocDate":"28-SEP-2005"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
