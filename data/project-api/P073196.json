The project includes a quick disbursement mechanism that uses a positive list of emergency imports, to generate counterpart funds to finance rapid project implementation. The primary benefit is the return of veterans to their communities, to resume a productive social, and economic life. A secondary benefit will be the reallocation of resources from defense expenditures, towards poverty reduction and accelerated economic growth. However, the resumption of hostilities is the major external risk, while project specific risks are linked to weak implementation capacity, and the expected rapid pace of demobilization. Full disbursement is expected by December 31, 2003, and a retroactive financing of up to thirty five percent of the total amount of the credit, has been agreed against a positive list of imports made after June 18, 2000."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"170,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Resettlement Plan,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"54,58","mjthemecode":"7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080402012119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080402012119","DocDate":"21-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000160016_20051220122528","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051220122528","DocDate":"07-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20030606104640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20030606104640","DocDate":"05-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03062104154546","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03062104154546","DocDate":"31-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_03061404155562","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03061404155562","DocDate":"23-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201170960","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201170960","DocURL":"21-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201170960","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201170960","DocDate":"21-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_00111505400622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00111505400622","DocDate":"09-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00112305434034","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112305434034","DocDate":"22-SEP-2000"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
