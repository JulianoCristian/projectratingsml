This strategy focuses on the control of education expenditures, more efficient use of education resources, improvement of the quality of education, and strengthening of vocational training.  To that end, the project aims to (a) promote institutional development; (b) to improve the quality of primary and lower secondary education; and (c) to meet some of the country's human resource needs.  In order to accomplish the above, the project consists of:  (a) institutional development including strengthening of planning and management; (b) quality improvement in upgrading of the skills of about 2000 primary and 350 lower secondary teachers; and (c) manpower development with establishment of a National Center for Technical Education and Vocational Training at Ouani.  This latter component will train skilled workers for industry, and establishment of a new business school at Moroni to train office clerks, accountants and secretaries."},"country_namecode":"Union of the Comoros!$!KM","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"7,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"KM","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019171316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019171316","DocDate":"29-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36815_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36815_1_0","DocDate":"06-JAN-1987"}],"countryname":"Union of the Comoros"}},"facets":{}}
