Three subsequent, follow-on country projects under the ASP-P1 are: the Mali Project objective is to assist the Government of Mali to dispose of publicly-held obsolete pesticide stocks at priority selected sites, to support the clean-up preparation of contaminated soils of priority sites, and to support actions to help prevent the future accumulation of new stocks of obsolete pesticides; the objective of the ASP-P1 Morocco Project supports the overall ASP-P1 objective to eliminate inventoried publicly-held-obsolete pesticide stockpiles and associated waste, and implement measures to reduce and prevent future related risks; and the Tanzania Project will assist the Government of Tanzania to dispose of publicly-held obsolete pesticide stocks at priority selected sites and to support
