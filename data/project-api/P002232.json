It consists of actions in four areas: (a) resource mobilization; (b) urban management; (c) promotion of artisans and construction of industry; and (d) program management. Specific actions under resource mobilization would include the introduction of a property tax and improved financial management. Support would also be given to the Inter-Communal Development Credit agency (CID). Actions to promote better urban management consist primarily of strengthening the capacity of communes in major cities and towns to maintain infrastructure and improve land tenure. Production workshops will be established and other assistance will be provided to artisans. Support to the domestic construction industry will consist of measures to increase the supply and quality of local building materials. Finally, the program will be carried out primarily by the communes. A coordination unit in the public works ministry will provide guidance during implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"UM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban management","code":"UM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007150219","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007150219","DocDate":"26-OCT-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120494299","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120494299","DocDate":"13-SEP-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120494299","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120494299","DocURL":"13-SEP-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100430012158","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100430012158","DocDate":"30-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07fe9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07fe9_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926234908","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926234908","DocDate":"26-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926235042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926235042","DocDate":"26-MAY-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda"}},"facets":{}}
