There are three project components. The first finances technical assistance, training, office equipment, hardware, and software to improve the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, and Family (MOLSAF), the Social Insurance Agency (SIA), and the National Labor Office (NLO). In particular, it assists the MOLSAF in developing a multi-pillar pension reform. The component also targets training on actuarial projections, public information campaigns, policy analysis for other social programs, and human resource training. The second component finances technical assistance, hardware, software, and services to put in place and manage an efficient infrastructure to process the financial flow to and from the social sector agencies, initially, to collect social insurance contributions and employment program contributions. Activities under this component include technical assistance for joint collection system and client services, and for audit and enforcement. The third component develops a client database and information systems to support social sector programs. Activities included under this component include an application environment to support individual client accounting for pensions and sickness insurance; and database migration."},"country_namecode":"Slovak Republic!$!SK","sector1":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":66},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":34},"theme1":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"23,540,000","sector":[{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"SK","sectorcode":"BC,BE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rule of law","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"28,33,87","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,3,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":66},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":34}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20081020025954","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081020025954","DocDate":"29-SEP-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200465843","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200465843","DocURL":"29-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200470145","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200470145","DocURL":"29-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200465944","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200465944","DocURL":"29-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02013004010620","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02013004010620","DocDate":"17-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99082605313313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99082605313313","DocDate":"19-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061112391021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061112391021","DocDate":"15-FEB-1994"}],"countryname":"Slovak Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
