Component 1 - Regional Laboratory and contingencies, will support the establishment of a regional laboratory to implement highly-specialized functions, as a single regional institution. These functions include: a) acting as a regional reference diagnostic; b) becoming a specialized regional training center on HIV/AIDS related technologies for laboratory workers; c) developing information systems for laboratories specialized in HIV/AIDS tests; d) carrying out specialized research on technologies for testing HIV/AIDS viruses; e) becoming the regional center for quality control of HIV/AIDS national laboratories; and f) assessing and transferring technologies to national laboratories. Component 2 - Epidemiological Surveillance - will support the implementation of a regional second-generation epidemiological surveillance system, to enable improved characterization of the nature of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Central America.
