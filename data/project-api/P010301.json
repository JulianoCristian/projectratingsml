It aims to enable the State Cement Corporation of Pakistan (SCCP) to modernize its facilities, reduce operating costs, improve environmental controls, train operating personnel and formulate a Corporate Strategy in order to respond to the new competitive market environment. To this end, the project intends to assist SCCP in converting one plant from wet process to dry process, and rehabilitating and modernizing five other SCCP plants for improvement of energy efficiency, productivity and environmental controls. In addition, the project hopes to improve SCCP management through the establishment of a Corporate Strategy for SCCP, supported by a modern Management Information System and a human resources development program for training of personnel.
