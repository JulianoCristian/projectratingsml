The project includes the following components:  (a) strengthening of the natural resources monitoring and forest policies; (b) strengthening of land policies and institutions; and (c) strengthening of regional and district forest services in Mwanza and Tabora regions.  The first component will support the collection of natural resource information and development of a natural resource information system; development and implementation of improved practices for royalty collection and for afforestation based on private sector nurseries and active participation from local people; and preparation of an action plan for the long-term financing of the forestry subsector.  The second component will support the development of land policies and government's ongoing program of village demarcation, titling, and registration; and the third component will support the development of regional forest management plans and associated forest service reorganization and training."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":39},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":21},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"18,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"AB,BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83,79,25,27","mjthemecode":"2,2,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":39},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":21}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99122006032323","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99122006032323","DocDate":"15-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121080044","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121080044","DocURL":"24-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121080044","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121080044","DocDate":"24-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121080245","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121080245","DocDate":"24-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e39461_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e39461_1_0","DocDate":"11-FEB-1992"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
