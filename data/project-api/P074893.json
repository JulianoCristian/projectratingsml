The project will pursue five major areas of reform: 1) budget formulation, to increase the usefulness of the budget as a strategic policy instrument, and ensure that the Government is capable of formulating a budget within macroeconomic constraints; 2) budget execution, to strengthen the Treasury's control over spending commitments and extra-budgetary funds; 3) audit, to establish an internal audit department in the Ministry of Finance, and units in other key Government agencies, and, strengthen the State Audit Office's ability to focus on high risk entities; 4) procurement, to support the enactment of a new procurement law, and the creation of a specialized procurement bureau in the Ministry of Finance; and, 5) civil service, to create a mechanism to enforce civil service hiring requirements, and introduce a uniform, decompressed salary structure for civil servants. In addition, the project will support specific reforms in the health sector, including improvements in the internal control system of the Health Insurance Fund, and in the procurement of pharmaceuticals. Linked donor finance will also support technical assistance, and policy studies, aimed at improving the administration and targeting of health insurance subsidies, pension contributions, social assistance, and child allowances. Political and implementation risks shall be minimized, because key reforms will be completed prior to Board presentation, and the inclusion of a second tranche release will be contingent full compliance with reform implementation."},"country_namecode":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of!$!MK","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MK","sectorcode":"JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,27,51,67","mjthemecode":"8,6,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":70},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100810034821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100810034821","DocDate":"29-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20051221170906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051221170906","DocDate":"21-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"005092751_2007061516244151","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005092751_2007061516244151","DocURL":"15-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"005092751_2007061516244151","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005092751_2007061516244151","DocDate":"15-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20040423113019","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040423113019","DocDate":"13-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000160016_20040209150154","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040209150154","DocDate":"17-NOV-2003"}],"countryname":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of"}},"facets":{}}
