Priority training programs will be identified, and subsequently, contract the provision of training with qualified providers. Training proposals will be evaluated on the basis of economic interest, social equity, technical feasibility, cost estimates, and financial planning; 2) develop a strong monitoring, and evaluation system, to generate timely information on the implementation of the training program, on the market for training, i.e., beneficiary groups' knowledge, and appreciation of the Fund's program, and, on the impact of training. Longitudinal studies will measure the economic impact, to allow progressive policy adjustments, and rationalized financial allocations; and, 3) will strengthen the institutional development of the Fonds de Developpement de la Formation Professionnelle Continue et de l'Apprentissage, and finance overseas study, training, and technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"59,66,53,25,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,2,6,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20060308095408","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060308095408","DocDate":"01-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201145470","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201145470","DocURL":"26-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201145470","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201145470","DocDate":"26-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201145168","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201145168","DocURL":"26-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201145168","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201145168","DocDate":"26-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201145269","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201145269","DocDate":"26-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00063005311636","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00063005311636","DocDate":"09-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00101905451459","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00101905451459","DocDate":"14-MAR-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
