There are three components. The first purchases irrigation operations and maintenance equipment including wireless sets, motorcycles, vehicles, computers, cranes, winches and small backhoes/loaders, trucks, gradalls (truck-mounted machines with telescopic booms and wide buckets), graders, bulldozers, excavators, and draglines. The second component provides for consultants, training and study tours, computers, office and training equipment, and field vehicles. The third component helps a WUO purchase and install a drip irrigation system, which receives water from a small dam through an installed pipeline system, thus eliminating the need to use electricity for pumps to create pressure."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":72},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"BC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,86,78,77","mjthemecode":"10,10,11,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":72},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050303090832","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050303090832","DocDate":"10-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200335794","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200335794","DocURL":"28-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980728143129","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980728143129","DocDate":"18-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
