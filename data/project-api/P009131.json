There are six components. The first provides technical assistance to selected banks addressing treasury and financial risk management, strategic planning, accounting, internal audits, management information systems (MIS), and credit risk management. Experts will be placed in participating banks in order to design and implement reforms. The second component provides technical assistance to all commercial banks, and funds training in critical risk management areas. The third component strengthens the legal/regulatory and supervisory capacity of the central bank. The fourth component strengthens the MIS available to support bank manager decisionmaking; upgrades payments systems, improves telecommunications performance supporting MIS and payments systems; and establishes a global security system to safeguard the commercial banks' data transfer networks. The fifth component funds bank privatization and restructuring. The sixth component supports the strengthening of the project implementation unit."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uzbekistan!$!UZ","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","Percent":18},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"UZ","sectorcode":"FG,BC,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,42,38,34,43","mjthemecode":"4,3,4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","code":"FG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":32},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":18}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040702112716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040702112716","DocDate":"22-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200410998","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200410998","DocURL":"23-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200410998","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200410998","DocDate":"23-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200411199","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200411199","DocDate":"23-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200411199","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200411199","DocURL":"23-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9905260826221","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9905260826221","DocDate":"28-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911063558","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911063558","DocDate":"30-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060911502396","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060911502396","DocDate":"18-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052115581478","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052115581478","DocDate":"18-AUG-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uzbekistan"}},"facets":{}}
