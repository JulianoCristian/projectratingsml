These changes are required for the following reasons. The current project development objectives (PDOs) are too ambitious and the indicators cannot be accurately measured. These problems were identified by a review conducted by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) on October 6, 2008. The current project closing date needs to be extended due to protracted implementation delay resulting from: (a) unanticipated changes in leadership in the Ministry of Fish Wealth (MFW), the project's implementing entity, which resulted in inconsistent support for sector reforms; and (b) the initial underestimation of project cost that resulted in a financial gap of about USD7 million. Furthermore, the underestimation of project cost has resulted in a need to reallocate the proceeds among the project's categories, some of which have already been over withdrawn."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Central
