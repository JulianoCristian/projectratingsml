The project comprises the construction of a 500 MW (4 x 125 MW) hydro-power station including all equipment, civil works and a transmission line to the Western Regional grid. Main works include a 90 m high, 1650 m long combined gravity and rock-fill dam, about 4500 m of tunnels and shafts, a powerhouse, and 5 km of discharge channels. The project also includes a pilot thermal plant rehabilitation program designed to provide for more efficient use of MPEB's thermal stations, which will serve as a basis for eventual development of an India-wide rehabilitation program, and improvement and expansion of MPEB's data processing unit and services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"300,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029221317","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029221317","DocDate":"24-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e061c8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e061c8_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99d1b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99d1b_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99d19_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99d19_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e99d18_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99d18_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902441988","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902441988","DocDate":"30-APR-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
