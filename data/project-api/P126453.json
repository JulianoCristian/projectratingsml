Tonga's economy is beginning to recover from the series of crises that have buffeted it in recent years, but the incipient recovery is dependent on external support. Tonga is a small, remote economy that is highly vulnerable to external shocks and dependent on a limited number of sources of foreign exchange. In recent years, Tonga has undertaken a number of important public sector and economic reforms, but robust economic growth has remained elusive. Over the last four years, the series of crises that have buffeted the Tongan economy have caused economic contraction, a significant fiscal gap, and rising poverty. The multi-year programmatic series of operations will assist the GoT to appropriately sequence key public sector and economic reforms over a medium-term time horizon, while supporting the GoT's capacity to deliver services in a challenging fiscal environment. The operation carries a high risk on account of the limited institutional capacity of the GoT, the recent nature of Tonga's political reforms, and Tonga's uncertain external environment."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Tonga!$!TO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":58},"sector2":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":14},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Other Renewable Energy","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":44},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"},{"Name":"Other Renewable Energy"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Summary of Discussion,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"TO","sectorcode":"LR,LA,JB,LC,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Economic management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"54,25,27,23,24","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"1,1,2,2,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"},{"name":"Other Renewable Energy","code":"LR"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":58},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":14},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":14},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":7},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20131226145157","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20131226145157","DocDate":"13-DEC-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012040923385400","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012040923385400","DocDate":"09-APR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000333038_20111124000012","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20111124000012","DocDate":"22-NOV-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20111101004947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20111101004947","DocDate":"21-OCT-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000003596_20110714100912","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000003596_20110714100912","DocDate":"10-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000020953_20110929150425","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20110929150425","DocDate":"10-JUN-2011"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Tonga","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
