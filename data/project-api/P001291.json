The project will develop indigenous renewable energy resources and create new job opportunities, particularly during the construction period, and reduce the country's heavy dependence on imported oil. The main project components are: (i) a rock and earthfill dam (approximately 100 m high with a crest length of about one km), a saddle dam with a concrete-lined spillway, and two diversion tunnels; (ii) an intake, a concrete and steel-lined shaft and a tunnel to connect the reservoir to an underground powerhouse, and a reinforced concrete surge shaft near the downstream end of the tunnel; (iii) an underground powerhouse with two 70 MW vertical turbines, and a short tailrace tunnel; (iv) a 220-kV switchyard; (v) 80 km of 220-kV transmission lines to connect the powerhouse to the existing grid; and (vi) consultants' services for detailed design and construction supervision, project team leader, and a panel of experts to advise on civil works."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"95,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a50_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a50_1_0","DocDate":"06-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a4e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a4e_1_0","DocDate":"06-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a4d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a4d_1_0","DocDate":"06-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101652","DocDate":"30-NOV-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810190101566","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190101566","DocDate":"30-NOV-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
