The project has the following three components: Component 1) the proposed activity would support the ESSP 2004-08 Education Facilities Development Program providing lower secondary schools in communes without them, prioritizing communes with the highest poverty incidence levels. The provision of scholarships to poor children-especially poor girls and ethnic minority children-is an actionable measure under the NPRS to foster universal basic education and is operationalized in the ESSP 2004-08 under the Secondary Scholarships for the Poor Program. Component 2) will focus on strategic interventions around decentralized quality improvement in order to encourage right-age enrollment, foster promotion of students in lower primary, increase retention of students in upper primary, foster transition to lower secondary education and ultimately enhance student learning. Component 3) will address the implementation of additional selected interventions under the ESSP, to be agreed with IDA during project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of
