The project will also entail an investment component involving the implementation of a four-year time-slice of WAPDA's investment program, while improving the reliability of the system; and a technical assistance component involving consulting services and training for strengthening WAPDA's environmental capability."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"230,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"BG,BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"34,40,43,82","mjthemecode":"11,4,4,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0206060401141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0206060401141","DocDate":"08-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200145524","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200145524","DocURL":"14-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200145725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200145725","DocDate":"14-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200145524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200145524","DocDate":"14-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200145725","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200145725","DocURL":"14-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99e4d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99e4d_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99e4a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99e4a_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003122608","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003122608","DocDate":"03-JUN-1994"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
