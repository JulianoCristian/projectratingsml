The components call for: 1) civil works to install interceptors, and laterals to collect the northern, and southern areas' waste-waters, and in part, the collection of the central area's discharge into the western, and eastern trunk mains; 2) construction, and installation of reinforced concrete pipe for the western trunk main , and related tunnels; 3) installation of the eastern trunk main, to be constructed as a tunnel, to connect to a culvert before reaching the treatment works; 4) waste-water treatment works, to allow an acceptable waste-water quality, to be diluted with surface water, and enable unrestricted irrigation practices in the surrounding areas. Secondary treatment chlorination will dissinfect treated effluents for suitable irrigation purposes, and a further tertiary treatment will be extended if required. Treated effluents, and sludge will be reused for agricultural purposes under the irrigation scheme; 5) strategic operation, and maintenance works will be contracted, under the supervision of the Tehran Sewerage Company (TSC) ; and, 6) technical assistance, to strengthen TSC's capacity, allow private sector participation, and, achieve flexibility for staff deployment."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Iran!$!IR","sector1":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"145,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"IR","sectorcode":"BC,WS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,27,85,84,71","mjthemecode":"9,11,11,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090730024939","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090730024939","DocDate":"29-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201455484","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201455484","DocURL":"26-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2008040211255685","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2008040211255685","DocURL":"26-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0004200546513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0004200546513","DocDate":"03-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00021105302869","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00021105302869","DocDate":"30-SEP-1999"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Iran"}},"facets":{}}
