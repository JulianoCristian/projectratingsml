The Project aims at ensuring that public resources are both available, and effectively used to meet Lao PDR's development outcomes. Three broad benefits can be identified: improved public expenditure management performance; alignment of public expenditures with pro-poor National Growth and Poverty eradication Strategy (NGPES) goals; and, enhanced environment for growth and revenue generation. While the project also entails benefits such as policy prioritization and donor coordination, predictability of funding and donor support, and, budget support within macro stability, five main risks could affect the impact of the proposed operation: the authorities' uneven commitment to reforms; a weak public financial management system leads to a high fiduciary risk; provincial autonomy hinders implementation of national Policies, and an equitable distribution of resources; short-term fiscal un-sustainability; and, severe capacity constraints in the civil service. The project benefits outweigh its risks, and furthermore, an explicit recognition by the Government of weaknesses, will place Capacity Enhancement (CE) at the center of the reform program. As a result, capacity is being strengthened through reforms, and by the active engagement of other donors."},"country_namecode":"Lao People's Democratic Republic!$!LA","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"LA","sectorcode":"AT,EZ,JA,FA,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"67,25,43,27,40","mjthemecode":"4,2,4,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":60},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":12},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":12},{"Name":"Education","Percent":12},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20090820022504","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090820022504","DocDate":"01-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000021321_2005100713125175","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005100713125175","DocDate":"03-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2005100713125175","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005100713125175","DocURL":"03-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050315090133","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050315090133","DocDate":"11-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050317102402","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050317102402","DocDate":"19-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20050106144815","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050106144815","DocDate":"06-DEC-2004"}],"countryname":"Lao People's Democratic Republic"}},"facets":{}}
