It will also provide for the strengthening of BNT's and the Ministry of Agriculture's credit extension program. The Third Agricultural Credit Project will improve the organization and effectiveness of BNT's agricultural lending operations. The incomes of the direct credit beneficiaries, about 2,250 small and medium farmers, 900 large farmers, the members of 170 production cooperatives and 25 service cooperatives will be substantially increased. This will affect about 11,800 farm families totalling 70,000 members of whom 43 percent, or 30,000, are expected to come from the target group. About 1,100 permanent jobs, 900 seasonal jobs and 1,200 man-years of additional family labor will be generated from investments in farm development. This employment generation will affect another 12,000 people in farm families, of whom about 11,000 are expected to come from the target group."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925043539","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925043539","DocDate":"21-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000020953_20081219152151","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20081219152151","DocDate":"21-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902355168","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902355168","DocDate":"30-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191249437","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191249437","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20111116023532","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20111116023532","DocDate":"27-MAY-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
