The complex will include facilities to produce the following end products: sulfuric acid - 660,000 tpy, phosphoric acid - 198,000 tpy, nitric acid - 215,000 tpy, ammonium nitrate - 270,000 tpy, diammonium phosphate - 275,000 tpy, and compound fertilizers - 250,000 tpy. In view of the steps being taken to promote the use of high analysis fertilizers and of their inherent advantages, the market risk is acceptable. The company is taking steps to reduce the management risk by improving methods in some fields. Overall, the project presents a moderate level of risk."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"IC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","code":"IC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8dbf3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8dbf3_1_0","DocDate":"12-APR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8dbf2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8dbf2_1_0","DocDate":"12-APR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902323778","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902323778","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912423262","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912423262","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
