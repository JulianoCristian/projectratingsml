These works are intended to reduce the danger to livelihoods and property from future flooding; (ii) address the medium and long term requirements for sustainable watershed development by preparing a Watershed Management Plan which will serve as the basis for more integrated, conservation-minded development of key watersheds; and (iii) strengthen the Government's capacities in environmental management and flood preparedness. Hence, the Government will seek the direct participation of the population in the project's activities and also attempt to build greater local capacity of Saint Lucian professionals to engage in
