The project consists of four components;1)construction of a new highway between Karachi and Hyderabad; 2) construction of three major bridges across the Jnelum, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers; 3) the employment of management consultants to advise and assist the Building and Roads Branch (B & R) of the Provincial Government, and 4) the employment of consulting engineers to carry out feasibility studies of access to Karachi and Hyderabad. An adequate and efficient system of transport is essential where an accelerated economic development program is planned, as it is in West Pakistan. The Government has recognized this need and is giving high priority to the development of its transport facilities. It is aware that the execution of large agricultural and industrial projects and the growth of supporting economic activities will require the rapid and reliable movement of building materials, equipments machinery, and consumer goods and foodstuff. This project will assist in the extension and rehabilitation of the main National Highway System linking all the major population, and commercial centers."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"17,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903474199","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903474199","DocDate":"31-MAY-1964"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902435443","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902435443","DocDate":"31-MAY-1964"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
