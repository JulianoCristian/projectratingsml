Some of the quantifiable benefits expected to result from the road improvements are reduced vehicle operating costs, reduced produce spoilage and induced increases in agricultural production. Institution building represents a major, if unquantifiable benefit. About one-third of the benefits from increased cash crop production are expected to accrue to farmers and the Government while most benefits resulting from increased foodcrop production will go to farmers. Benefits from reduction in transport costs are expected to be shared by transporters, traders and the local communities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Togo!$!TG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Agreement","countrycode":"TG","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924193835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924193835","DocDate":"09-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902302740","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902302740","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912383852","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912383852","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228be1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228be1_1_0","DocDate":"23-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Togo"}},"facets":{}}
