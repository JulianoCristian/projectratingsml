The project will contribute in minimizing the impacts of the emergency, by defraying substantial, unexpected expenditures incurred in the implementation of the comprehensive containment, and recovery plan. Although the achievement of a rapid, sustainable reinstatement of a sanitary status, will enable the country regain access to premium export markets, and re-activate livestock production, risks associated with the deteriorating sanitary situation in the region, and the effectiveness of similar, neighboring countries' efforts, will require extreme caution to avoid recurrence of the current FMD outbreak. To this end, a regional task force has been created, to coordinate efforts, and ensure measures are being enforced region-wide, and, project activities will directly support these measures."},"country_namecode":"Oriental Republic of Uruguay!$!UY","sector1":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"18,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"UY","sectorcode":"BC,AJ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Trade and integration","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,45,52","mjthemecode":"6,5,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":86},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20100810025551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100810025551","DocDate":"26-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"007527627_2007082909085827","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007527627_2007082909085827","DocDate":"28-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"007527627_2007082909085827","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007527627_2007082909085827","DocURL":"28-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201554297","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201554297","DocURL":"08-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_01071404024673","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01071404024673","DocDate":"09-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01081004134688","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01081004134688","DocDate":"03-JUL-2001"}],"countryname":"Oriental Republic of Uruguay"}},"facets":{}}
