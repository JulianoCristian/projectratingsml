The connection from Rio Lindo to the Sula Valley and the Atlantic coast with a 138 kV line would supply power for the agricultural and industrial needs of a fertile and economically active area. Other important 69 kV connections would be from San Pedro Sula, the country's largest industrial town, to the port of Puerto Cortes; from the port of La Ceiba to the Aguan Valley, as yet relatively undeveloped, where promising agricultural schemes are already or soon to be under way; and from the capital of Tegucigalpa to the southern zone, which is slated to receive some priority in national development. The project would also include installation of a 15 MW gas turbine in Tegucigalpa, a training program, feasibility studies on hydro projects and a tariff study."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Guarantee Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912401386","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912401386","DocDate":"05-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903172251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903172251","DocDate":"30-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b0822b8ada_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0822b8ada_1_0","DocDate":"16-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da5721_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da5721_1_0","DocDate":"16-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67f81_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67f81_1_0","DocDate":"16-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a2f9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a2f9_1_0","DocDate":"16-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903331224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903331224","DocDate":"31-MAY-1970"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras"}},"facets":{}}
