The project consists of four components. First, subproject financing represents the core of the project. This component will include social and economic infrastructure identified by communities, nongovernmental organizations, and local government representatives. The majority of the demand will be for education, health, water supply and sewerage, and social projects. Second, capacity building of municipalities/communities will support training activities for local governments, special projects for indigenous people, and programs specifically targeted at women. The third component will support analysis of 1998 and future Living Standards Measurement Surveys, updating of Social Investment Fund's (FISE's) poverty maps; and analysis of the 1998 and future FISE impact evaluations. Fourth, project management will cover operating costs, office expansion and rehabilitation, staff training, as well as improvement of office technology equipment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
