The measures supported by the PRSC-8 are expected to have a significant positive direct impact on poverty reduction. Specifically, the improvement in the investment climate and the promotion of exports supported by the proposed operation will sustain economic growth. The reforms in public service provision through decentralization will improve access of the poor to education, health, water, and sanitation services, support their greater participation in the growth process and sustain progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The strengthening of public financial management is expected to enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability in public resources use. Such measures will also increase the country's absorption capacity for external resources. Burkina Faso continues to be vulnerable to commodity price fluctuation, further increases in oil and food prices could undermine macroeconomic stability and progress made in poverty reduction. High oil prices drain international reserves and increase petrochemical, electricity and transportation costs with adverse impact on the overall economy. Increased world prices on basic food commodities translate into higher inflation and hurt the poor, particularly in urban centers."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Sixi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le huiti\u00e8me Projet de cr\u00e9dit d\u2019appui \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-8) vise \u00e0 appuyer l\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration de la croissance r\u00e9elle et la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 incidence au Burkina Faso en soutenant une action visant \u00e0 : i) am\u00e9liorer le climat de l\u2019investissement et promouvoir les exportations ; ii) am\u00e9liorer l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services de base gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une d\u00e9centralisation plus pouss\u00e9e ; et iii) promouvoir l\u2019efficacit\u00e9, la transparence et la responsabilisation dans l\u2019utilisation des ressources publiques gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une am\u00e9lioration de la gestion des finances publiques.
