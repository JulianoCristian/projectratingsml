The project includes two main contracts: (a) a turnkey contract for the provision of civil works and electrification for the 12.8 km of metro line which is financed by the Bank, Japanese Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and State; and (b) a concession to operate the system for 30 years, in exchange for the provision of the rolling stock and systems, financed mainly by the private sector and the State. The Bank may provide additional financing through additional loans in the context of ongoing, well-performing projects. The additional financing requested by the State is being requested solely to cover a portion of the financing gap due to the devaluation of the US$ in relation to the Brazilian currency. The additional financing will also cover the cost of extending the supervision services and project management oversight consultant. The additional financing operation can be accommodated in the context of the ongoing project, with the Sao Paulo Metro organization responsible for implementation as it has proven its ability to handle such contracts with good results."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de la L\u00ednea 4 del
