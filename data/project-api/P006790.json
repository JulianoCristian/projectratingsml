The project consists mainly of the 1985-90 time-slice of EEEB's distribution and subtransmission program, including the expansion and improvement of Bogota's network, studies to improve EEEB's distribution and operational planning, a training program for EEEB's staff and a program for reducing the system's losses.  Around 240,000 new customers will be connected to the power services, 1,100 MVA in subtransmission substation will be built, and about 10 km of 230 kV and 75 km of 115 kV lines will be constructed, together with 350 MVA in distribution substations and 1,000 MVA of distribution transformer capacity and more then 1,400 km of new primary and secondary distribution circuits."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"171,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019120625","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019120625","DocDate":"19-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702140210","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702140210","DocDate":"30-NOV-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
