The project has the following four components: Component 1) will strengthen the National Authority for Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety (ANSVSA) and Phyto-sanitary units so that they are better able to (i) implement the new food safety regulations adopted by Romania in compliance with EU accession requirements; and (ii) provide the necessary control and verification of fresh and processed products to enable farmers, ago-industry and food processors to supply local and international markets. Component 2) will strengthen the capacity of the national agricultural research system (NARS) to provide agricultural knowledge, skills and information to farmers and agro-processors based on the needs of the agro-food sub-sector and in line with the EU requirements. Component 3) will provide support for advisory and information systems. Component 4) will provide for project co-ordination and administration, procurement, financial management, reporting, monitoring and evaluation activities for all components."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
