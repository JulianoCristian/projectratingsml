It finances supplies, equipment, medicines and medical supplies as well as incremental operating costs for supplemental feeding of children up to 6 years, pregnant and lactating women, and adolescent girls; and regularly monitors malnutrition. It immunizes against 6 childhood diseases to reduce infant and child mortality; and provides appropriate and timely health care. It promotes overall psychosocial development of the child, including pre-school education, and promotes caregiver awareness. 2) It provides adolescent girls with iron supplements and de-worming treatment. The second component 1) supplies equipment at the district, state, and central project management unit (CPMU) levels, as well as vehicles, salaries, rent, and other operating costs; 2) strengthens district training teams; and 3) supports material and media services, communication training and campaigns as well as community mobilization activities.
