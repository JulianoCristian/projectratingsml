The groundwork will also be laid for eventually extending SRDP management and financial control to all rubber-producing provinces.  To increase rubber production, the proposed project will establish about 76,000 ha of rubber, provide planting materials for an additional 19,500 ha to be established by partially-assisted farmers, and maintain about 57,000 ha of previously established rubber.  To promote institution building, the project will emphasize manpower training and help develop the institutional and financial arrangements required for successful PMU rubber establishment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"131,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925210714","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925210714","DocDate":"29-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151725","DocDate":"31-JAN-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
