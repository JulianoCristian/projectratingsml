The Bank loan is a combined operation:  sectoral for PROSANEAR, and a project loan for the municipality of Campinas in the State of Sao Paulo.  The project consists of two main components: one for  (a) low income areas which will improve health and environmental conditions by providing water and sanitation services to the extremely poor urban families; and (b) an expansion of the City of Campinas water supply to eliminate existing water rationing.  The low income areas sector component consists of:  (a) a group of subprojects benefitting approximately 200,000 and 700,000 low income urban population with water and sewerage services, respectively; (b) provision of complementary sanitation services; and a (c) technical assistance program for PROSANEAR and for increasing the evaluation and supervision capabilities of the Federal Savings Bank (CEF). The Campinas component consists of works to improve and expand the city's water supply system to  meet demand through 2002 benefitting more than 860,000 people."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":3},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":52},"sector3":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":42},"sector4":{"Name":"Solid waste management","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Solid waste management"}],"docty":"Other Agricultural Study,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Project Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"WB,WS,WC,WA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,57,84,71","mjthemecode":"9,11,7,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Solid waste management","code":"WB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":3},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":52},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":42},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Other Agricultural Study (AGRS),  Vol.1","DocType":"AGRS","EntityID":"000333037_20081026234720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20081026234720","DocDate":"01-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980313101611","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980313101611","DocDate":"11-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042713563511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042713563511","DocDate":"19-FEB-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042615451814","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042615451814","DocDate":"30-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042009174212","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042009174212","DocDate":"30-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032512094913","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032512094913","DocDate":"30-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926164735","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926164735","DocDate":"10-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926164611","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926164611","DocDate":"10-JUN-1988"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
