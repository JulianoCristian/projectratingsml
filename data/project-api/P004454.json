The project would increase yields and farm incomes on about 9,400 ha dispersed in Northern Luzon and in Western and Central Visayas. At full development, this would result in additional annual paddy production of about 29,000 tons. Some 8,500 families, most of whom are below the poverty line, would benefit directly from the increased production and subsequent employment. The road component is tentatively expected to improve access for some 78,000 families by linking relatively isolated villages to the mainstream of economic life of the provinces. About 47,000 poverty level families would benefit from the health facilities to be provided under the project, while the 300 village wells would improve the availability and quality of water for some 100,000 families."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"28,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924200802","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924200802","DocDate":"30-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924200629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924200629","DocDate":"30-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228bac_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228bac_1_0","DocDate":"11-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902302537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902302537","DocDate":"31-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912375985","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912375985","DocDate":"31-MAR-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
