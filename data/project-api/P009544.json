This will be achieved by: (a) providing wider and more equitable access to minor irrigation through the introduction of more affordable and manageable irrigation technologies; (b) institutionalizing policy changes recently introduced by the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) to liberalize trade and siting of equipment; (c) upgrading the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation's (BADC) capability to support the private sector through advice, market information and quality enhancement; (d) facilitating  access to deep tubewell (DTW) ownership by opening ownership to various forms of association besides traditional cooperatives; and (e) assisting GOB in introducing and maintaining a nation-wide consistent approach to minor irrigation development. To that end, the project provides for irrigation development on some 265,000 ha through financing: (i) procurement of new DTWs; (ii) rehabilitation of about 1,800 existing DTWs; (iii) improvement of drainage canals; and (iv) installation of pontoon mounted pump schemes.  The project also finances: (a) demonstration irrigation systems covering about 10,000 ha; (b) capacity building technical assistance in such areas as environment protection, information dissemination, and private sector support; and (c) technical assistance to support project implementation."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"54,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,44,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123283160","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283160","DocURL":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123282959","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123282959","DocDate":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123282657","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123282657","DocURL":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123282758","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123282758","DocURL":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123282959","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123282959","DocURL":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123283160","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283160","DocDate":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123283261","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283261","DocURL":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123283261","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283261","DocDate":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123282657","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123282657","DocDate":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123282758","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123282758","DocDate":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e3929b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3929b_1_0","DocDate":"23-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929110003","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929110003","DocDate":"26-APR-1991"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
