There are six project components. The first supports the government's program for sector reform and privatization in telecommunications and power infrastructure; finances preparation and execution of public enteprise divestiture transactions in the other sectors; finances competitively selected investment advisers and legal and technical advisers; and finances consultant studies. The second component finances and strengthens the government institutions responsible for undertaking the privatization program and sector reforms. The third component helps mount a major communications and public relations campaign at home and abroad to explain and publicize the reforms. The fourth component develops a national policy on telecommunications; reviews, develops, and implements new and comprehensive telecommunications legislation and regulations, among other telecommunications reforms. The fifth component develops a national power policy and a legal and regulatory framework, among other power sector reforms. The sixth component restructures the Lagos State Water Corporation (LWSC), and implements private sector participation and an emergency action plan to support LWSC during the transition."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"Power","Percent":11},"sector3":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"114,290,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Board Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"BG,WC,LD,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,43","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":78},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":11},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20110417233444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20110417233444","DocDate":"28-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20080201033824","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080201033824","DocDate":"30-JAN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333038_20080131082139","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080131082139","DocDate":"01-JAN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000160016_20050617122647","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050617122647","DocDate":"02-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201215754","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201215754","DocURL":"23-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201215955","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201215955","DocURL":"23-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0106050402141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0106050402141","DocDate":"21-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01030205432593","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01030205432593","DocDate":"31-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00062305373231","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00062305373231","DocDate":"13-OCT-2000"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
