To date, 90 percent of the loan or US$ 36 million has been disbursed and more than 1,000,000 m of polluted soil has been safely disposed in the constructed and operational hazardous waste landfill. Works on the Intumak Reservoir Rehabilitation are approximately 50 percent complete. In accordance with the developed action plan and the plan of works by the contractors, the majority of works can be completed by the end of 2010, with the final closure of the landfill in spring 2011 after the flood season. All procurement under the project is finalized. The total costs of the project increased from the original US$ 67.82 million to US$ 97.42 million during the detail design phase (financed under the project after the loan effectiveness due to its complexity and costs). Subsequently, the ministry of finance preferred to finance the increase of costs from additional government co-financing rather than an increase of the loan."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
