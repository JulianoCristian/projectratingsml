The additional financing will help finance the costs associated with a financing gap for micro-projects that are underway and are therefore prerequisite in fulfilling the expectations of the poor communities. The additional financing to the current participating States to complete the original project activities will therefore: (i) ensure that all micro-projects are completed at the close of the project; (ii) increase the project's impact and development effectiveness; and (iii) serve as a bridging fund - pending the commencement of the National Community Driven Development Program (National CDD) as a follow-on to the Community-based Poverty Reduction Project (CPRP). The National CDD would build on the CPRP, scaling it up both geographically to cover other states, and thematically to cover additional activities. Implementation, financial and procurement arrangements will remain the same. The indicators for the additional financing will be the same as in the current project but the targets are to be revised as a result of the increased funding for micro-projects. The expected outcomes from the additional funding will be: (a) improved services and infrastructure in participating poor communities; (b) increased capacity of government to support, monitor, and evaluate poverty reduction activities; and (c) increased capacity at state level for implementing community-driven development, and for financing community-generated projects."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":24},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social
