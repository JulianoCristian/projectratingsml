The Southern Conveyor Project's primary objectives are (i) to ensure adequate water supplies to four major population areas and nearby villages, and (ii) to maintain vitally important irrigated crop production in an area threatened by aquifer seawater intrusion and extend irrigation in other selected areas.  The project also aims to rationalize further the utilization of the country's scarce water resources through appropriate institutional reform and the implementation of realistic cost recovery measures for both domestic and irrigation water.  The second phase of the project supplements phase I through the following:  (a) the Dhiarizos diversion works, including a tunnel; (b) irrigation distribution networks for 4,335 ha; and (c) domestic water treatment works at Limassol and Tersephanou, the Tersephanou-Nicosia conveyor and about 20 rural water supply schemes.  In addition, phase II provides (d) on-farm development through the medium-term; (e) provision of O&M and miscellaneous equipment; and (f) provision of technical services and training."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cyprus!$!CY","sector1":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Flood protection"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CY","sectorcode":"BC,WD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,85,75,82","mjthemecode":"11,10,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":94},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926095304","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926095304","DocDate":"28-JAN-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cyprus"}},"facets":{}}
