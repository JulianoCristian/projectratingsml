The project includes rehabilitation of:  (i) the Owen Falls Power Station; and (ii) the transmission and distribution network. The first component consists of the rehabilitation of ten turbogenerator units and structural repairs to the dam and power house at Owen Falls.  The transmission component consists of the uprating of the transmission lines between Owen Falls and Kampala and the strengthening of the lines between Kampala and Nkenda, and between Tororo and Lira.  (iii) The provision of vehicles, tools and equipment for maintenance and repair services as well as the rehabilitation of UEB's Staff Training Center, operational buildings, staff housing and the implementation of a training study aim to support the first two components.  (iv) The project further includes studies of UEB's tariff structure, level, billing and collection system, and the provision of a computer for UEB.  In addition, the venture provides technical assistance which focuses on the new Energy Department, a forest and fuelwood plantation inventory, fuelwood marketing and a household energy survey in major towns of Uganda."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"28,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019174932","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019174932","DocDate":"26-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e06111_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e06111_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0610f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0610f_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135804","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135804","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101107","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101107","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
