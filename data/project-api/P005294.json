It extends the use of improved planning and design standards to smaller towns and cities in the country.  Specifically, the project finances, through a line of credit, subprojects located throughout Jordan.  These subprojects comprise:  (a) upgrading and new site development to benefit about 8,000 households; (b) mortgage loans for about 5,000 families in these sites to enable them to purchase plots and finance house construction or improvements; and (c) community facilities, such as schools, clinics, and community and training centers.  It also entails (d) advisory services, training and logistical support for institutional strengthening.  The principal benefit of the project will be improved provision of shelter and related services at prices affordable to low-income households without resorting to large Government subsidies.  At least 60 percent of the investment will benefit households between the 10th and the 40th percentiles of the urban income range."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban development adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"26,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban development adjustment"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"JO","sectorcode":"UU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban development adjustment","code":"UU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961219132804","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219132804","DocDate":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040712032994","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040712032994","DocDate":"13-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010043014293895","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010043014293895","DocDate":"13-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926075502","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926075502","DocDate":"18-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan"}},"facets":{}}
