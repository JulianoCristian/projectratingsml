The traditional system of channel maintenance involving large-scale excavation would be changed by introducing balanced work-cycles of weed mowing, chemical treatment and desilting for various channels.  The loan, itself, would finance the upgrading of the equipment fleet of contracting agencies, including private sector companies; cycle-based maintenance schedules to be introduced over the entire 48,000 km network of public channels; and technical assistance for the agencies organized under the Ministry of Irrigation for channel maintenance.  These include the Irrigation Sector, the Weed Research Institute, and the Public Sector Excavation Companies."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"70,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122124910","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122124910","DocURL":"10-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122124609","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122124609","DocURL":"10-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122124609","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122124609","DocDate":"10-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122124910","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122124910","DocDate":"10-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092741","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092741","DocDate":"30-JUN-1986"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
