There are four components to the project, the first component being nature of services to be subsidized. Although the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) funded technical audit (TA)-study proposed the funding of 40,000 facilities, the project will be substantially larger than GPOBA has normally considered. Therefore it is an alternative where there is already an agreement on the neighbourhoods that are considered priority and the reduction on the number of septic tanks to be subsidized. The second component is the targeting of subsidies. Poverty is prevailing in the perimeter of the Periurban Communities of Dakar (PAQPUD). Therefore, the program relies on geographic targeting. Within each targeted commune, a single level of contribution per household is applied. However, inclusion and exclusion risks are low: within this area, well-off households are already equipped with proper sanitation system; the only inclusion risk will be well-off households recently settled in the perimeter, which remains marginal. No major change to the targeting strategy has been identified as this approach turned out to be already well adapted and efficient. However, one of the key part of the project's design consisted in identifying further mode of kind payment (participation to the work) in order to reduce the closing financial contribution of the poorest households. The third component is the mechanisms for monitoring and verification of outputs. The project team recommends enhancing this mechanism by recruiting an independent auditor in charge of periodical control of the reality of works, through sample onsite control for the initial four years of th"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"7,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sanitation"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Program Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"WA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"71","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20120706031741","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120706031741","DocDate":"27-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012010114574617","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012010114574617","DocDate":"01-JAN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011070915360787","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011070915360787","DocDate":"09-JUL-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010121214074635","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010121214074635","DocDate":"12-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000310607_20070328162753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070328162753","DocDate":"26-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000020953_20070123105156","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070123105156","DocDate":"01-DEC-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000090341_20061208114632","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061208114632","DocDate":"21-NOV-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000020953_20070405083732","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070405083732","DocDate":"01-JAN-2006"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
