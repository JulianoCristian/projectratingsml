The project objective is one of confirming in more LGUs that the project design concept in APL1 (i.e., with appropriate technical and financial designs, pricing rules and institutional incentives, water supply systems, irrespective of size, can be made both viable and sustainable), is robust enough to be mainstreamed into the water supply sector of the Philippines. There are four project components. The first finances civil works, equipment, and supervision for improved water supply systems in LGUs, water utilities where private operators were selected under procedures acceptable to the Bank, and regional water utilities. The second component finances physical infrastructure in household toilets, on-site sanitation facilities, including soakaway pits for septic tank effluents or the disposal of wastewater flows arising from augmented water supplies hygiene education. The third component finances investments and consultant services in micro-drainage infrastructure. Finally, the fourth component funds the hiring of a construction supervision consultant and of specialized consultants."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Water
