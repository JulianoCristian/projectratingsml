The specific medium-term objective is to increase technical and managerial services delivery to small-scale irrigation producers. Furthermore, the project will, through training, strengthen: (a) financial institution expertise in appraising investment projects in irrigation; and (b) technical performance of individual consultants and firms. The project's seven components are: (1) support to the implementing agency, aimed at building institutional and technical capacity; (2) technical and managerial services and training, aimed at improving capacity of small-scale irrigation producers, private sector entities, and financial institutions; (3) legal services and technical studies to formalize land tenure arrangements, and create legally registered producer groups; (4) testing of irrigation equipment; (5) capacity building aimed at strengthening producer organizations and individual private irrigators; (6) environmental monitoring and mitigation of water-borne diseases and soil degradation; and (7) socio-economic surveys and studies aimed at monitoring incentives and development impact."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":48},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"4,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"General finance sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"FZ,BG,BC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,77,39,78","mjthemecode":"10,4,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":48},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":34},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000020953_20071010111756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20071010111756","DocDate":"25-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040213101148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040213101148","DocDate":"01-JAN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172116","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121415358","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121415358","DocURL":"03-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121415861","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121415861","DocURL":"03-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102922","DocDate":"29-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000386194_20120921040703","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120921040703","DocDate":"20-APR-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
