In pursuit of stable macroeconomic frameworks, policy reforms will be consolidated, and, poverty alleviation accelerated. The project will improve the supply of power, water, and sanitation systems, increasing the operational and end-user efficiency of infrastructure sectors. Renewable energy sources will be developed, as will a sound management of water resources. The components of the project call for: 1) reforms and development of the power sector, supporting privatization of public entities, its financial restructuring, and, the implementation of regulatory and legal frameworks. Demand-side management and energy efficient equipment are included as marginal economic extension and environmental liability mitigation; 2) renewable energy promotion and development, decentralizing wind/solar photovoltaic systems; 3) reform and development of the water sector, supporting new regulatory/legal frameworks, new autonomous water companies, and, extending water networks; 4) sanitation development and improvement, through the construction of wastewater reuse systems; and, 5) Project coordination/management, supporting institutional strengthening."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cabo Verde!$!CV","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":44},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":39},"sector3":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"17,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Renewable energy"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CV","sectorcode":"LE,WA,WC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,74,81,44,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,11,9,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":44},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":39},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20090728015620","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090728015620","DocDate":"30-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123540295","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123540295","DocURL":"03-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123540496","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123540496","DocDate":"03-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123540295","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123540295","DocDate":"03-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99043005314088","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99043005314088","DocDate":"15-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101844","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101844","DocDate":"22-FEB-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cabo Verde"}},"facets":{}}
