The project would support the Government's new policy of Free Primary Education (FPE), and it would also assist the country to move towards the Millennium Development Goal of having all children throughout Kenya able to complete a full course of primary schooling by Year 2015. There are three components to the project: 1) The bulk of project funds would be used for the scaling-up of the recently evaluated Government/DFID textbook program, using school grants, the existing procurement system (which is considered to be competitive), and the existing financial management system (though with additional training of school staff and local community representatives). 2) The proposed capacity building component would have four sub-components: (i) school-based teacher development and support; (ii) school accounting system; (iii) education management information system; and (iv) system design and program preparation. 3) This component has three activities: (i) monitoring; (ii) evaluation; and (iii) external audit. Monitoring would focus on the key performance indicators at outcome and output level. Project monitoring will be the responsibility of the Project Coordinator and the component/sub-component managers. Project activities and expenditure would be reviewed through the regular monthly meetings convened by the Project Coordinator, against the annual plan and budget approved by the Project Steering Committee at the start of each year."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"65","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080827004300","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080827004300","DocDate":"20-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20050615160452","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050615160452","DocDate":"01-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20030603102622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030603102622","DocDate":"23-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03031804015732","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03031804015732","DocDate":"14-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03032004092769","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03032004092769","DocDate":"12-MAR-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
