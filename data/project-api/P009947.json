The project comprises the installation of three combined cycle power stations located at Kawas (Gujarat), Anta (Rajasthan), and Auraiya (Uttar Pradesh), as well as associated transmission lines for connection to the transmission grid.  This project will introduce combined cycle operation as a new technology as well as the use of natural gas as a fuel for power generation in India.  The gas will be provided primarily from the offshore South Bassein gas field and through the Hazira-Bijaipur-Jagdishpur (HBJ) pipeline."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"485,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"PY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","code":"PY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019173520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019173520","DocDate":"29-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094614","DocDate":"31-MAR-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095715","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095715","DocDate":"28-FEB-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
