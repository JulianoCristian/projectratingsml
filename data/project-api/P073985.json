The project has the following four components. Component 1) will includes the implementation of a three-year program of promotional actions, with the overall objective of increasing bicycle use in the three Comunas. Component 2) will provide technical assistance for evaluating the economic and environmental impact of clean technologies for buses. The tests will be developed using a state of the art emissions laboratory for heavy duty vehicles located at the 3 CV facilities. The business structure of bus services in Santiago has resulted in a costly and environmentally unsustainable surface public transport system. Key issues include: (a) lack of an organizational model that would facilitate efficient public transport operation, (b) dispersed operations that hinder the effective control of bus services and contribute to traffic congestion, (c) lack of professional management among bus operators, and (d) an unattractive image which induces potential bus passengers to use private vehicles instead. The implementation of the bus routes, and more specifically of the trunk routes on segregated busways is expected to allow the road-based public transport system to run more efficiently with a reduced number of buses. Component 3) current tools for policy making rely on the use of transport models inter-phased with an emission model assessing emission changes due to changes in direct transport measures. 4) Developing the Central Ring of Santiago (Anillo Central).
