The proposed project forms part of EEEB's 1979-82 Investment Program, and is aimed at expansion, rehabilitation and modernization of the urban distribution network, including strengthening of the company's distribution planning, design, operating and maintenance practices. The impact of the project on Bogota's development would be considerable; it is estimated that it would supply electricity to an estimated 157,000 new residential, commercial and industrial subscribers. About thirty-five percent of the new subscribers are expected to be in the lower income group. The project would also contribute to enhancing the reliability of electricity services throughout the urban area. The project is not subject to significant risks and is expected to be carried out as scheduled. All appropriate provisions have been made to minimize the environmental impact of the facilities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"87,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96115_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96115_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e96114_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96114_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902341279","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902341279","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912471634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912471634","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
