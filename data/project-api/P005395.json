The project will finance: (i) upgrading of squatter settlements; (ii) provision of affordable serviced residential plots; (iii) credit for self-help housing improvement; (iv) construction of community facilities; (v) development of serviced land for business activities; (vi) provision of facilities, equipment and technical assistance to improve municipal services in the project cities; and (vii) studies for the preparation of new urban development projects. About 66,000 persons in the urban poverty group, representing 39 percent and 57 percent of the urban poor in Meknes and Kenitra, will benefit directly from the project. Improved municipal services will benefit about 70 percent of the urban poor in the project cities. The primary risks relate to the need for adequate staffing of the project implementing agencies in order to monitor, supervise and coordinate project implementation, particularly in view of the relatively limited experience in Morocco with beneficiary selection and cost recovery for this kind of project."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"36,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"UH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban housing","code":"UH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925015657","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925015657","DocDate":"28-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925054458","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925054458","DocDate":"23-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e975e4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975e4_1_0","DocDate":"22-JAN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902364471","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902364471","DocDate":"31-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912512378","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912512378","DocDate":"31-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333037_20100318022029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100318022029","DocDate":"15-DEC-1980"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
