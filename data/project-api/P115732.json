Given the deep impact Latvia has suffered in the wake of the global crisis, and due to the emergency nature of this program, the first operation will focus mainly on the first and second objectives. The second operation will expand this focus to the third objective. The financial crisis hit Latvia at a time when the country was particularly vulnerable, and its impact has been felt more deeply than elsewhere in the region, the economy is estimated to have declined by 18 percent in 2009 and to further contract by 4 percent in 2010. The program of World Bank support will focus on measures designed to mitigate the social impact of fiscal consolidation, and on the implementation of the Government's cross sector Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy (ESSNS). To increase transparency and accountability, the ESSNS includes procedures for and adequate financing to closely monitor its implementation and rigorously evaluate its impact."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Latvia!$!LV","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":27},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":30},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":60},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":10},"totalcommamt":"143,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"LV","sectorcode":"EZ,JA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"themecode":"67,54,65","mjthemecode":"8,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":45},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":28},{"Name":"Education","Percent":27}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20120719005052","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120719005052","DocDate":"25-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010081316085884","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010081316085884","DocDate":"12-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20100221232341","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100221232341","DocDate":"12-FEB-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090811124147","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090811124147","DocDate":"07-AUG-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Latvia"}},"facets":{}}
