The restructuring is intended to: a) extend the project closing date by 12 months from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013; and b) adjust the results framework indicators and targets to reflect the extension periods, facilitate measuring progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO) and track the required core indicators. The extension was requested by the Mongolian Ministry of Finance in a letter dated October 25, 2012. The extension is necessary to complete the construction of a school complex in the Baganuur district of Ulaanbaatar, which is a high priority educational intervention for the government. The changes to the results framework have been discussed and agreed with the Ministry of Education and Science during the course of project supervision."},"country_namecode":"Mongolia!$!MN","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"8,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan","countrycode":"MN","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"65","mjthemecode":"8,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20140703122021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20140703122021","DocDate":"30-JUN-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b08216d24e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08216d24e_1_0","DocDate":"23-DEC-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081edb10c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081edb10c_1_0","DocDate":"17-SEP-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081838d4a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081838d4a_1_0","DocDate":"24-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012070411082456","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012070411082456","DocDate":"04-JUL-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b0812362e5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0812362e5_1_0","DocDate":"10-FEB-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20130912115027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130912115027","DocDate":"07-FEB-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011070512570563","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011070512570563","DocDate":"05-JUL-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011010112183174","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011010112183174","DocDate":"01-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20101221011806","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20101221011806","DocDate":"03-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20101221010518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20101221010518","DocDate":"03-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000356161_20110524011440","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110524011440","DocDate":"05-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000020953_20071119150211","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20071119150211","DocDate":"18-NOV-2007"}],"countryname":"Mongolia"}},"facets":{}}
