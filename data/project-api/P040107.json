There are three components. Component One modernizes judicial administration and improves judicial performance in selected districts. Its first sub-component strengthens district offices and gives judges economic autonomy, designs a preferential fee scheme for low-income groups, and supports a public information campaign. Its second sub-component improves the quality, predictability, and timeliness of judicial decisionmaking; implements pilot programs in selected districts; forms forums discussing specific judgments; develops incentives; expands court libraries; implements pilot-tested court organization and case processing procedures; holds workshops; studies quantitative and qualitative indicators measuring performance; implements judicial information systems and statistics; and remodels physical facilities.  Component two establishes a judicial career system and improves judicial ethics and accountability. Its sub-components strengthen judicial selection and evaluation; develop judicial institutions and implement training programs; and strengthen the disciplinary system of the office supervising magistrates. Component three implements training programs for popularly elected lay judges and community authorities, refines laws and regulations; promotes alternative dispute resolution; and develops the Public Defender."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Access to law and justice","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"22,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"BG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Rule of law"],"themecode":"31,32","mjthemecode":"3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Access to law and justice","code":"31"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000094946_00091605302761","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00091605302761","DocDate":"30-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3971229181044","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229181044","DocDate":"27-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182313","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
