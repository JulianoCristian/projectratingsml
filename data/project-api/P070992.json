This is consistent with broader efforts to reduce public spending and focus it on priority needs, and to address regional imbalances within each Entity. These objectives are key elements of the recently approved Medium Term Development Strategy (PRSP). Specifically, the priority program goals are to: (1) ensure that protection for disabled veterans and survivor families is better focused on the most disabled, while gradually reducing public spending on veterans' programs; (2) improve the impact and efficiency of the social safety net for the poorest, in particular social welfare benefits and services, including a strengthened role for the non-government sector; (3) consolidate an appropriate institutional structure for employment services at State and Entity levels, and reorient active labor policies to increase cost effectiveness, transparency and employment outcomes; (iv) improve the efficiency and equity of pension and disability programs, including pensions policy harmonization between the Entities of BH; and (v) ensure that social policy reforms are done on the basis of better information, within the system and to the public, and that living standards monitoring is  more effective and timely."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"51,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"BA","sectorcode":"BE,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"58,61,51,54,87","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,6,6,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":75},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000020953_20070124143853","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070124143853","DocDate":"03-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010030111525253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111525253","DocDate":"21-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010030111525253","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111525253","DocURL":"21-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20040526095726","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040526095726","DocDate":"17-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042314275052","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042314275052","DocDate":"31-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02030704011194","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02030704011194","DocDate":"29-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02022204105884","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022204105884","DocDate":"20-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061715560653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061715560653","DocDate":"19-JAN-2001"}],"countryname":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
