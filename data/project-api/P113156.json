There is an immediate need to minimize the risk of a repeated food shortage. In the short-term, this can be achieved by ensuring adequacy of resources to: (i) continue to effectively support food-insecure households through the PSNP; and (ii) import critical agricultural inputs, primarily fertilizer. Unless the livelihoods of food-insecure households are protected and unless Ethiopian farmers have adequate supply of fertilizers, the food shortage Ethiopia is currently experiencing is almost certain to recur on a much larger magnitude, even with good rains. Over the longer term, complementary efforts to boost agricultural productivity and reduce vulnerability to shocks must be further strengthened."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>ETHIOPIE / REPONSE A LA CRISE ALIMENTAIRE MONDIALE</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le Projet sur le programme de riposte \u00e0 la crise alimentaire de l\u2019\u00c9thiopie a pour objectif de prendre une part active aux efforts que le gouvernement d\u00e9ploie pour maintenir une couverture ad\u00e9quate du Programme pour la pr\u00e9servation d\u2019un filet de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (PSNP) en \u00c9thiopie en 2009, garantissant ainsi que les objectifs de d\u00e9veloppement du projet du PSNP peuvent \u00eatre atteints.
