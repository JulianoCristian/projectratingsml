This loan supports sustained progress in all reform areas covered in the first programmatic operation and gives particular recognition to accelerated implementation of major and difficult financial sector reforms, beyond the scope of the first programmatic operation (report no. P7448). Areas covered include: progress concerning program actions to enhance access to and raise efficiency in financial intermediation, to promote banking system soundness and prevent financial crises, to improve governance, and reduce systemic payments risks, as well as major restructuring of federal banks, and privatization of state-owned public banks. The loan also covers the passage/submission of major legal reforms pertaining to the financial sector."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Housing finance","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"International financial architecture","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"404,040,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Capital markets"},{"Name":"Housing finance"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"FG,FE,FC,FK,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"42,46,40,38,44","mjthemecode":"4,4,4,5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"},{"name":"Housing finance","code":"FC"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","code":"FG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"International financial architecture","code":"46"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":50},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":13},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":10},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20030930101806","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20030930101806","DocDate":"26-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201574584","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201574584","DocDate":"23-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201574584","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201574584","DocURL":"23-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000094946_02061304013224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02061304013224","DocDate":"20-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02050204345140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02050204345140","DocDate":"15-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02042504022359","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02042504022359","DocDate":"08-APR-2002"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
