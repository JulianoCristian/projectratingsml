The Highway Sector Investment Program Project will support this by: 1) reducing vehicle operating costs through maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction of roads; and 2) ensuring that improvements are sustained by developing and implementing cost recovery policies, building and utilizing indigenous capacity in the public and private sectors, and improving financial management and control. The main components of the project are: 1) maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction of the road network; 2) institutional strengthening and capacity building, which consist of strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Roads and Highways, the Ghana Highway Authority, the Department of Feeder Roads, the Department of Urban Roads, the National Development Planning Commission, and the domestic construction industry through appropriate institutional reforms, technical assistance, training and logistical support; and 3) policy reform including the following issues: cost recovery, private sector financing, increased environmental sensitivity, axle load control and road safety."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"78,82,76","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"10,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":85},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0207120403189","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0207120403189","DocDate":"21-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121282225","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121282225","DocURL":"26-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121282225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121282225","DocDate":"26-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022105246","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022105246","DocDate":"19-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110210","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110210","DocDate":"30-JUN-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
