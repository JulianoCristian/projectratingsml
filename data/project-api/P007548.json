Special emphasis will be given to meeting the needs of enterprises located outside the main urban concentrations. FOGAIN will provide credit through financial intermediaries and guarantee credit from financial intermediaries to finance fixed assets and associated working capital; minority equity investments will be made directly by FOMIN; industrial estate facilities, building and equipment leasing services on industrial estates will be provided through FIDEIN, and technical assistance will be provided by Nacional Financiera and other specialized institutions. The project faces no special risks,though some components may develop more slowly than others."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"47,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"IL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","code":"IL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902303250","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902303250","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912334076","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912334076","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c54_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c54_1_0","DocDate":"27-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c53_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c53_1_0","DocDate":"27-APR-1978"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
