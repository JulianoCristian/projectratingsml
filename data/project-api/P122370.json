The loan would provide emergency assistance to preserve social expenditures in education and health as Guatemala devotes significant fiscal resources to recovery and reconstruction after severe flooding and other natural disasters suffered between May and September 2010. The loan would be a reallocation of financing from within the existing country lending envelope, taking funds from a previously planned third phase Development Policy Loan (DPL) that will have supported continued progress on governance, transparency, and fiscal reform. The Bank is also to restructure an existing World Bank financed rural development project to provide US$15 million for reconstruction of bridges in addition to an approved World Bank financed project, expanding opportunities for vulnerable groups. Other bilateral and multilateral donors are providing emergency humanitarian assistance as well as funds for infrastructure, rural development, climate change risk mitigation, and disaster risk
