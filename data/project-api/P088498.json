To this end, the financing system for tertiary education will be revamped in order to enhance the quality, and relevance of tertiary education; ensure access to tertiary education; and, improve internal efficiency, and accountability for results. The Tertiary Education Finance for Results Project's development objective is to increase the effectiveness of public funding for tertiary education, so as to enhance coherence, responsiveness, and, equity and quality in the system, through stronger accountability for performance. The project has two main components as follows. The first component will strengthen the institutional framework for tertiary education. It entails: improved sector oversight, and regulation; strong policies and strategies for tertiary education; consolidation of the national system for quality assurance; establishment of a national observatory within tertiary education; and, project management activities. The second component comprises sub-projects to enhance coherence, efficiency, equity and quality. These subprojects will be innovative within tertiary programs, and, shall stimulate institutional effectiveness in critical areas, implemented through performance agreements. Beyond the program, the goal is to support the Government in completing the transition from the current funding system, to a performance-based system applied to an agreed proportion of base funding for universities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Chile \u2013 Proyecto de financiamiento por resultados de la educaci\u00f3n terciaria \u2013 Primera fase de pr\u00e9stamo adaptable para programas</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"25,130,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Indigenous Peoples Plan,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"66,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20110810005858","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110810005858","DocDate":"24-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011011118180719","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011011118180719","DocDate":"11-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2006012611482978","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006012611482978","DocDate":"19-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2006012611482978","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006012611482978","DocURL":"19-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20050616092300","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050616092300","DocDate":"19-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20050304110633","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050304110633","DocDate":"02-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20050304102817","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050304102817","DocDate":"02-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000090341_20050210113026","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050210113026","DocDate":"01-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000090341_20041022112309","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041022112309","DocDate":"06-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20040928092304","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040928092304","DocDate":"10-SEP-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
