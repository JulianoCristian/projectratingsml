The extension is necessary to start the implementation of MOF's Strategic Plan (SP), which was recently finalized after extensive work following the Mid-Term Review (MTR), to identify priority capacity development needs across MOF. The SP provides a detailed roadmap to strengthen MOF capacity for prudent, effective and accountable planning and management of public finances. The extension period will enable MOF to start preparations for any follow on program of support beyond November 2012, to be based on its SP. The extension also takes into account the need to provide a smooth transition during the presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled in 2012. The closing date of the project will be extended to November 30, 2012. This will be the first extension of the project."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!$!TP","sector1":{"Name":"Central government
