The change is to cancel XDR 6.1 million, as requested by the government of Cameroon in its letter received by the bank December 4, 2012. The change has no impact on project performance. Its implementation was prepared after the Bank mission in March 2012, and consisted of the suspension of project activities after June 30, 2012.
