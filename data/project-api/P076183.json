Three main components will support: 1) governance, by developing a strategy and medium-term development plan for the education sector, and a legislative and institutional framework, promoting improved management. Activities include a participatory higher education reform development, and the preparation of medium-term investment program, comprising as well capacity building to the Ministry of Higher Education staff, and, technical training to the two universities involved, for their management, and accountability assumption; 2) financing of the redesign process of the universities' budget structures, and procedures, to facilitate flexible allocation of resources, and efficient expenditures. Moreover, assistance for the development of equitable funding mechanisms for universities will be provided, to increase girls' education, and attendance by diverse income-level groups. Information management systems, and related training will be adapted to provide institutional management services; and, 3) quality of education, by upgrading the faculty in selected disciplines (medicine, education, and commerce), and piloting strategic initiatives, such as evaluation methods, and teaching skills, educational programs redesign, and an information communications technology network linking central, and faculty libraries via intranet access to Internet resources."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":32},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Rule of law","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,33,66","mjthemecode":"8,3,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":68},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":32}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000386194_20110701052124","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110701052124","DocDate":"22-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090602002701","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090602002701","DocDate":"27-JAN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201305952","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201305952","DocURL":"17-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02061104061183","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02061104061183","DocDate":"28-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02011804102635","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02011804102635","DocDate":"02-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02011804113939","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02011804113939","DocDate":"15-APR-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
