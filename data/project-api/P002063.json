On a nationwide but selective basis, the project will support the development of cattle and goats and to a small extent, sheep and poultry, emphasizing the small-scale private producer.  The main objective will be to increase livestock production through improved nutrition and animal health and thereby increase farmers' incomes. The project will include:  (i) credit for the purchase of farm inputs, including imported trypano-tolerant N'Dama cattle; (ii) equipment for participating institutions; and (iii) settling of pastoralists on grazing reserves.  It will also provide for (iv) livestock systems research; (v) a manpower development and training program; (vi) technical assistance; and (vii) greater involvement of the private sector in supporting services.  Furthermore, funds will be allocated for the (viii) establishment of a livestock sectoral planning capacity for the Federal Government; and (ix) for special studies of veterinary services, livestock census, and project monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"81,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214170535","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214170535","DocDate":"21-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092745","DocDate":"30-JUN-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095518","DocDate":"31-MAY-1986"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
