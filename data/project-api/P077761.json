The key components of the project are: 1) grid-connected renewable energy power generation, by enabling, on a large scale, the refinancing support for mini-hydro projects, and, by extending support to two other commercially available renewable energy sources - wind and biomass; 2) solar photovoltaic (PV) investments, by integrating refinance, grants, and technical assistance (TA) support, aiming at solidifying the existing middle-range solar home system market, and expand to smaller systems accessible to the poor, and community applications for health clinics, schools, public services; 3) independent grid systems, which will support commercialization of village hydro, and other community-based independent grid systems, through refinancing, and grant support. TA will address issues such as electricity use for income generation activities, once the grid connection is in place, while the status of independent grids within the sector reform agenda, will be emphasized in the broader sector TA; 4) TA, and limited credit support to prod private sector development in the provision of energy efficiency services, and demand side management will be provided, including the integration of sustainable implementation of such programs into sector reforms; 5) cross-sectoral energy applications, i.e., provision of credit support to rural enterprises, TA to service institutions for energy development, and co-financing support for investments in selected areas; and, 6) TA (in addition to the component-specific assistance) for project administration, subproject promotion, technology and"},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Renewable energy"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"LE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,39,81,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120628031602","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120628031602","DocDate":"20-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20110309020454","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110309020454","DocDate":"06-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333038_20100708005645","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100708005645","DocDate":"30-APR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02060504020489","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02060504020489","DocDate":"24-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0205170414508","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0205170414508","DocDate":"10-MAY-2002"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
