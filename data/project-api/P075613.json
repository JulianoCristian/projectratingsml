There are 3 components to the Project. Component A is the Ankang-Maoba Expressway (AME). This component includes the construction of an 87 km expressway connecting Ankang and Maoba and includes the construction of the relevant ancillary buildings and the acquisition of the relevant electrical and mechanical (E&M) facilities. It will also require the acquisition of land and the resettlement of people. The design of the AME has paid adequate consideration to road safety features and has minimized the social and environmental impacts, based on the analysis undertaken at the feasibility stage and further adjustments required upon completion of the preliminary engineering designs. A joint local-foreign consulting firm will supervise the construction of the AME, in a manner similar to the one implemented under the AME component o f the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project. Component B is the Local Roads Improvement Program (LRIP). The LRIP aims at improving of interconnection between provincial, county and village roads in the rural areas surrounding the corridor Ankang - Maoba Expressway.
