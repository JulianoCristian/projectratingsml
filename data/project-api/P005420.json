It is intended to direct efforts toward expansion, improvement and modernization of the telecommunications network. Major emphasis is placed on institutional development as the principle means of strengthening implementation capacity. Once completed, it will add about 290,000 new lines of exchange capacity and local cable distribution networks for 300,000 subscriber connections, including rehabilitation of obsolete local line systems. In addition, long distance systems will be modernized and expanded, thus reducing congestion and improving the overall efficiency of networks."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"125,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"CC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","code":"CC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019120301","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019120301","DocDate":"23-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091858","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091858","DocDate":"31-MAR-1987"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
