The additional credit will help finance the costs associated with activities aiming to enhance the impact and development effectiveness of CEP in the economic and financial crisis environment. The AF will aim to maintain and enhance the competitiveness of the Moldovan enterprise sector through a combination of: (i) scaling up of the existing matching grant component in order to assist enterprises with upgrading their labor skills and management practices, and introducing new products; and (ii)a new Line of Credit (LOC) component that will support the investment and working capital needs of exporting enterprises. The main expected outcome of the AF will be the improved access of private enterprises to credit and business development services. A secondary outcome will be the improved ability of Moldovan banks to provide term financing to the enterprise sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"General
