The project aims at increasing rural incomes and foreign exchange earnings by import substitution and promoting private sector export marketing over a five-year period.  The project will accomplish this through a combination of policy reforms and investment to: alleviate malnutrition of the rural population by raising production, strengthening agricultural research and extension services, and supporting the organization of farmers and traders, including women.  The policy reforms will cover: (a) improving price incentives through reforms of cocoa pricing and the taxation system; (b) restructuring marketing and input supply systems of the traditional export sub-sector; (c) preparing and implementing programs aimed at removing technical constraints on higher cocoa output, including uncertainties over land tenure; and (d) promoting food crop production and non-traditional exports.  Project investments will comprise marketing, agricultural extension and applied research and institutional development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Equatorial Guinea!$!GQ","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"6,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GQ","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,77","mjthemecode":"10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":60},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008074725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008074725","DocDate":"23-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120583619","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120583619","DocURL":"21-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120583619","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120583619","DocDate":"21-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120583820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120583820","DocDate":"21-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120583820","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120583820","DocURL":"21-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000362596_2011120617070784","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000362596_2011120617070784","DocDate":"12-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082229114_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082229114_1_0","DocDate":"30-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929231241","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929231241","DocDate":"09-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929231029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929231029","DocDate":"14-SEP-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of Equatorial Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
