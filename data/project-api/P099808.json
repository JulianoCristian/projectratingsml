To achieve this, project support is in three areas: (1) prevention; (2) preparedness and planning; and (3) response and containment. There are three project components. Component 1 has three subcomponents that 1) strengthen the regulatory and institutional environment; develop detailed implementation guidelines and manuals as part of a national action and contingency plan; and establish a national compensation policy and fund; and strengthen disease monitoring and containment, diagnostic capacity and disease surveillance, and animal disease information systems; 2) enhance public health program planning and coordination, the national public health surveillance systems, and the health system response capacity; and 3) promote awareness and improve coordination to implement the contingency plans and the National \"Avian flu\" strategy."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration
