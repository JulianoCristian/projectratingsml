The specific objectives of the project are to: 1) strengthen human development program effectiveness through application of an improved framework of fiscal federalism, including inter-governmental cost sharing, better policy coordination, transparent budgetary planning and consumer voice; 2) reduce inequality by redirecting federal financial support to targeted interventions that benefit the disadvantages groups; and 3) eliminate disparities between high and low performing providers of public social services through enhanced quality and efficiency.
