The proposed operation is expected to help the implementation of the poverty reduction program by: (i) fostering macroeconomic and financial stability; (ii) improving budgeting and public expenditure management and basic service delivery (health, education, and water services); and (iii) improving the environment conducive to private-sector development. Four main risks could influence the expected outcomes of the proposed credit: (i) domestic political unrest and or external factors, including a shortfall in donor support, adverse climatic conditions, and social and political upheavals in neighboring countries; (ii) weak institutional, managerial and administrative capacity; (iii) slippages in key reforms; and (iv) growth and macroeconomic scenarios may not materialize. These risks are mitigated by the strength of the Government's ownership and commitment to implement the proposed measures, by an active policy dialogue between the Bank and the Government, and by donor's efforts to provide technical assistance to improve capacity-building , The project will be released in two tranches."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Niger!$!NE","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":16},"totalcommamt":"65,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Policy Research Working Paper,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"NE","sectorcode":"WC,LC,EZ,JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance","Human development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,78,65,27,67","mjthemecode":"8,2,8,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":15},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Policy Research Working Paper (WPS),  Vol.1","DocType":"WPS","EntityID":"000158349_20081106162239","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000158349_20081106162239","DocDate":"01-NOV-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050701134442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050701134442","DocDate":"29-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031114521488","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031114521488","DocDate":"04-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20040202092944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040202092944","DocDate":"25-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20040130161747","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040130161747","DocDate":"10-AUG-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Niger"}},"facets":{}}
