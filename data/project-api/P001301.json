Specifically the project would: (i) improve equity and quality of the education system by constructing a limited number of primary schools in deprived remote areas, by providing additional teacher training facilities, and by raising the level of educational quality through curriculum development and increased capacity to deliver educational media; and (ii) promote institutional development through strengthening the capability of the Government to plan effectively for the education sector and to manage its expansion at all levels."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"37,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"EY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other education","code":"EY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019170205","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019170205","DocDate":"01-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36b14_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36b14_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094555","DocDate":"28-FEB-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095902","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095902","DocDate":"31-DEC-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
