The project will be developed as an environmental/energy management project in the city of Klaipeda. It consists of two complementary components: 1) a technical assistance and training component for: (a) design of the geothermal loop including all necessary equipment for extracting the heat from the geothermal water and transferring it to the district heating system; (b) preparation of detailed drilling, testing and completion programs; (c) management support for project implementation, including support in preparing tender documents, and construction supervision; and (d) training of Lithuanian staff and management in the operation of a similar geothermal plant in Thisted, Denmark to optimize the transfer of technology; and 2) an investment component for: (a) establishment of two production wells and one injection well; (b) above ground facilities including building and necessary equipment such as absorption heat pumps, heat exchanger, and auxiliary equipment for control and regulation of the plant and the heat transfer to the district heating system; and (c) piping between production wells and geothermal plant, and between the geothermal plant to the injection well, and piping between the geothermal plant and the district heating network."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Lithuania!$!LT","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"5,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Agreement,GEF Project Document,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LT","sectorcode":"LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,74,81","mjthemecode":"11,9,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030625143058","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030625143058","DocDate":"11-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200234371","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200234371","DocURL":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200234371","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200234371","DocDate":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200234169","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200234169","DocURL":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200234270","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200234270","DocURL":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200234169","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200234169","DocDate":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200233968","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200233968","DocDate":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200234270","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200234270","DocDate":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"GEF Project Document (PD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PD","EntityID":"000009265_3961019233343","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019233343","DocDate":"30-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022105331","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022105331","DocDate":"11-APR-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Lithuania"}},"facets":{}}
