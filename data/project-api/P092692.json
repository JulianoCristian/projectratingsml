Damage to Grenada as a result of Hurricane Ivan was extensive. A comprehensive damage assessment prepared by the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), in collaboration with the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), puts the total damages at US$900 million, more than twice the country's GDP. Health and education infrastructure was particularly impacted, with the second biggest hospital, and most schools on the island rendered unusable. The project will provide the additional funds, available to support the overall recovery program, through the financing of critical imports, the rehabilitation of schools and education infrastructure, and recovery activities in the health sector. The focus of this project will therefore be to rehabilitate infrastructure in these areas. The project components include: I) Financing of critical imports; II) Assistance to the recovery of the education sector; III) Assistance to the recovery of the health sector; and, IV) Support to Project Management and Supervision."},"country_namecode":"Grenada!$!GD","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Technical Annex","countrycode":"GD","sectorcode":"JB,JA,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"52","mjthemecode":"6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":25},{"Name":"Education","Percent":25},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20091231004304","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20091231004304","DocDate":"14-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010022515011271","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010022515011271","DocDate":"19-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010022515011271","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010022515011271","DocURL":"19-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2006052508424980","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006052508424980","DocURL":"19-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2006052508424980","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006052508424980","DocDate":"19-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20041014124306","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20041014124306","DocDate":"12-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20041018130459","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20041018130459","DocDate":"12-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20041014113947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20041014113947","DocDate":"12-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20041018131034","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20041018131034","DocDate":"12-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000012009_20041105094109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041105094109","DocDate":"10-OCT-2004"}],"countryname":"Grenada"}},"facets":{}}
