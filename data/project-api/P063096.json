The project directly benefits an estimated 1000 poor rural families from congested communal areas through improved access to land and direct participation in complementary community investment subprojects. The project has four components. It establishes a land acquisition fund for a community-initiated, market-assisted approach. That is, self-identified communities or community groups of poor households purchase farms with resources from the fund. The second and third components support infrastructure investments through funding subprojects on a matching grant basis, a one-time cash start-up grant, and technical assistance to establish the land settlement and improve land productivity. The fourth component provides technical assistance, institutional support, project administration, and monitoring and evaluation, and possibly includes mobilization assistance for beneficiary communities and rural district councils, specialized skills training, publicity campaigns, and specialized studies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zimbabwe!$!ZW","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ZW","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,83,78,26","mjthemecode":"2,10,11,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000090341_20040721093704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040721093704","DocDate":"27-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0007210532514","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0007210532514","DocDate":"19-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99082405303973","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99082405303973","DocDate":"16-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99061205324693","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99061205324693","DocDate":"17-MAY-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zimbabwe"}},"facets":{}}
