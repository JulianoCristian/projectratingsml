This operation focuses on the power and gas sector, where there are more urgent reform needs. The hydrocarbons sector is also covered through some special issues on gas and to a more limited way on oil, although the scope of institutional strengthening embodies all areas under the purview of the energy sector authority. The ESTAL would consist of five components, aimed at furthering reforms in five main priority areas identified by the Government: 1) Market development and regulation - correcting problems with the regulatory system and with the wholesale and retail markets, with a view to providing the correct incentives for contracting and expansion in the sector; 2) Benefits to the poor - increasing access to and affordability of electricity, natural gas and LPG including through tariff reform with targeted, smart subsidies focused on those who are most in need; 3) Environmental management - enhancing the sector's environmental framework, management, capabilities, and licensing procedures; 4) Expansion planning - developing a strategy and methodologies for meeting future demand, integrating multiple sources of energy, as well as demand and supply side possibilities; and 5) Institutional strengthening - enhancing the Government's capacity for policy-making, and its ability to implement reform measures, coordinate multiple initiatives, and monitor their progress."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de Asistencia T\u00e9cnica para el Sector Energ\u00e9tico</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"12,120,000","sector":[{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Agreement,Disbursement Letter,Procurement Plan,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"LZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"86,40,30","mjthemecode":"2,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010122717024016","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010122717024016","DocDate":"27-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2010120114322502","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010120114322502","DocDate":"30-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Disbursement Letter (Disbursement Letter),  Vol.","DocType":"Disbursement Letter","EntityID":"014348236_2011061311264736","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=014348236_2011061311264736","DocDate":"08-APR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20090810020339","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090810020339","DocDate":"01-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010041612503314","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010041612503314","DocDate":"23-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20030605165226","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030605165226","DocDate":"29-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02031404021730","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02031404021730","DocDate":"12-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02031404050934","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02031404050934","DocDate":"12-MAR-2002"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
