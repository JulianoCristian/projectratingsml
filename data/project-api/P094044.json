The extension is necessary to ensure that the remaining project activities, related to the Igoeti-Sveneti road construction section of the E-60 highway, are completed. The civil works contract for this section was first awarded to Ashtrom International, Ltd in February 2008. This first contract was terminated by the roads department in July 2010 due to non performance by the contractor. A second civil works contract was subsequently awarded to New Energy - Al Hamra - Zimo Joint Venture in June 2011 to complete the remaining civil works comprising: (a) completion of the road construction; (b) remedial repairs; (c) construction of access and local roads; (d) construction of additional road safety measures; (e) environmental remediation activities; and (f) compensatory tree planting to rectify non-compliance with the Environmental Management Plans (EMP) due to the poor performance of the first contractor."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"Rural and
