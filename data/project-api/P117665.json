The Croatian authorities have been managing the impact of the global crisis relatively well through an appropriate mix of proactive policies. Due to declining tax revenues, the fiscal policy had to go through significant adjustments to protect macroeconomic stability and ensure regular debt service. Politically-challenging measures on both the revenue and spending sides had to be implemented, while protecting the effective part of the social safety net. Some of these measures, e.g., reduction of wages, suspension of pension indexation or the introduction of a solidarity tax, focused on the short term in order to maintain macroeconomic stability. Building on long-standing efforts in this area, the authorities have also taken necessary measures to safeguard financial intermediation. While the single-tranche DPL supports the authorities in these more immediate efforts, the engagement continues on the broader medium-term reform agenda. The Bank has for instance been providing analytical and financial assistance to Croatia in support of its medium-term competitiveness agenda, including through the recent European Union (EU) convergence report, investment operations in infrastructure and science and technology, and the forthcoming judicial reform project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Croatia!$!HR","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":73},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":18},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":11},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":45},"totalcommamt":"296,750,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Program Document,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"HR","sectorcode":"JB,FZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development","Economic management","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"27,23,40,54,67","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,6,4,1,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":73},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":18},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000356161_20101019032052","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101019032052","DocDate":"01-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20101001003615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20101001003615","DocDate":"23-AUG-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20091213225211","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091213225211","DocDate":"30-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100114031239","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100114031239","DocDate":"30-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20091112114356","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20091112114356","DocDate":"20-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000101930_20091001134643","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000101930_20091001134643","DocDate":"24-SEP-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Croatia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
