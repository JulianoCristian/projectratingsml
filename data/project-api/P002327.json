As such it will continue the process of channelling funds and technical services to small groups of rural people, who will provide labor and some cash for the development of several types of productive activities. The project introduces various producer groups to new technology and new activities and reinforces the local capacity for identification and preparation of small rural projects. Eight subprojects have been appraised, covering cereal, vegetable, fruit and honey production in different regions of the country. The project will finance land development works, irrigation systems and equipment, vehicles, inputs, training of farmer groups and staff, and operating costs of subprojects and a management unit. It also includes a provision for identifying and financing new subprojects in the course of project implementation. Beneficiaries are expected to make important contributions in cash and kind to the investments, replace all medium-term assets and bear all recurrent operating costs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":47},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":23},"sector4":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"16,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Animal production"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"AJ,AI,AZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,75,59,78","mjthemecode":"10,7,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":47},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":29},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":23},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00100305302370","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00100305302370","DocDate":"30-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030915370603","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030915370603","DocDate":"03-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e07f75_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07f75_1_0","DocDate":"21-MAR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07f73_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07f73_1_0","DocDate":"21-MAR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07b9c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07b9c_1_0","DocDate":"21-MAR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927131359","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927131359","DocDate":"28-FEB-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927131146","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927131146","DocDate":"06-FEB-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
