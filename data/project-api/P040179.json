The project consists of four components. The first component will implement the piloting of a new model for providing, organizing, and financing health services in San Miguelito Health Region. The second component will initiate the strengthening of the Ministry of Health (MOH) central level in the areas of policy making, regulation, and financing in order to support the pilot. It will also implement the corporate agreement between the MOH and Social Security Institute in key strategic areas. The third component will carry out studies, pilots, technical assistance, and training activities to scale up the reform to other health regions. It will also facilitate the constitution of health reform teams in other health regions together with the adaptations of the San Miguelito pilot to local conditions. Finally, the fourth component will finance administrative and operating costs of both the Project Coordinating Unit and the health region over a period of three years."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Panama!$!PA","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":52},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":48},"theme1":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"4,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PA","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,25,67,26","mjthemecode":"2,8,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":52},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":48}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050728110207","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050728110207","DocDate":"20-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200390512","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200390512","DocURL":"15-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200390512","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200390512","DocDate":"15-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980728143242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980728143242","DocDate":"26-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929094818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929094818","DocDate":"29-OCT-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Panama"}},"facets":{}}
