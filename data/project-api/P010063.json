Its lending has concentrated heavily on the export-oriented industries of textiles and jute. IDBP has, moreover, made special efforts to assist in East Pakistan, where 41 percent of the total amount of past lending has been directed; IDBP hopes to increase this percentage in its future operations. For the next phase of Pakistan's industrialization, adequate facilities for the financing of industrial investment will be very important. Among the chief priorities for investment are the expansion of the domestic jute processing industry, the modernization of the textile industry and the encouragement of certain engineering and chemical industries. IDBP should continue to play a key role in financing these developments."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"18,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081da56f5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da56f5_1_0","DocDate":"10-FEB-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da56f3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da56f3_1_0","DocDate":"10-FEB-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228aea_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228aea_1_0","DocDate":"10-FEB-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228ae9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228ae9_1_0","DocDate":"10-FEB-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228ae8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228ae8_1_0","DocDate":"10-FEB-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901580256","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901580256","DocDate":"31-JAN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903164385","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903164385","DocDate":"31-JAN-1970"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
