Both the World Bank and IMF are providing financial assistance to this effort. Concurrently, the Government has committed itself to protect and enhance social sector spending and program efficiency in the immediate term, and initiate reforms in key social sectors -health, social protection, and education- to provide a regulatory and institutional platform for medium and longer-term structural improvements in those areas. This project would be the first phase of the Bank's support to achieving these goals. The HDRL, like the overall program would focus on three critical aspects of social service reforms: (i) protecting and enhancing Ecuador's public sector investment in social sectors by supporting rationalized institutional budgets and financing for key social programs; (ii) increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of social programs through refocusing program objectives, improving targeting of social services, raising consistency in their administration, and promoting resource sharing among institutions; and (iii) enhancing the public consultations, transparency and accountability in the implementation of social programs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Non-compulsory health finance","Percent":8},"sector5":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory health finance"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Indigenous Peoples Plan,Program Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"BE,FB,JA,EZ,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"68,57,54,27,63","mjthemecode":"8,2,6,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Non-compulsory health finance","code":"FB"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":40},{"Name":"Education","Percent":25},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040726112536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040726112536","DocDate":"29-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031816005765","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031816005765","DocDate":"27-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000094946_03041704054756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03041704054756","DocDate":"30-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20030520161326","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030520161326","DocDate":"28-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03042504075136","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03042504075136","DocDate":"28-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03041004025749","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03041004025749","DocDate":"28-MAR-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
