The proposed project includes:  (a) recruitment of 6000 field extension workers, 3000 extension supervisors, 1000 subject matter specialists and 200 animal health officers.  It further involves (b) construction of 400 new Rural Extension Centers (REC); expansion of about 1,400 existing RECs; and construction of 200 animal health posts and 210 staff houses.  Finally, it aims to provide (c) procurement of the necessary vehicles, equipment and furniture; (d) overseas and local training of extension personnel; and (e) technical assistance and studies.  The unified extension service would help increase production of secondary crops, horticultural crops, estate crops, livestock and fisheries in order to provide the population with a more balanced and nutritious diet, as well as to increase tree crops and fisheries exports."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"70,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007151234","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007151234","DocDate":"25-OCT-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
