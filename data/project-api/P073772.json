Specifically, the project will enhance access to care, quality of care, and, health outcomes at the district level, while strengthening health work-force policy, management, and development in a decentralized context. A corollary development objective is to empower the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Ministry of National Education (MONE), and the Indonesian Medical Association (IMA), the three key stakeholders in the sector, through assistance to redefine their roles and responsibilities, vis-a-vis health work-force policy, planning, and management; and, by building their institutional capacity towards fulfilling policy making, legislation, regulation, quality assurance/control, and technical assistance. The project will have three components, each applicable to all three levels of governance: (1) improved health system stewardship, including policy and planning, management and system regulation; (2) sustained and expanded health services financing and delivery; and, (3) strengthened health workforce policy, management and training, including enhanced quality of medical education."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government
