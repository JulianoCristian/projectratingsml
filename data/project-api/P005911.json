This will be achieved through a Planned Change Program (PCP) designed to: (a) enhance the learning achievements of secondary students with special emphasis on science and mathematics education and equality of teaching; (b) improve the access of girls to secondary education; and (c) establish labor market oriented two-year post-secondary education programs covering business, commerce and industry. The project includes national and school-based subprojects designed to address the broad policy objectives in eight change areas: physical facilities, teacher performance, curriculum development, school management, learning resources, student evaluation, female access and community colleges. The reforms pursued under the PCP have a long-term perspective which requires evaluation and adjustment at different stages. The sector approach provides the necessary flexibility for making adjustments as the Program progresses, promotes the application of objective criteria for the allocation of funds to subprojects, and encourages cooperation and coordination among beneficiaries through an Intermediary Agency."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":56},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"BC,ET,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Human development","Human development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,78,66,65,71","mjthemecode":"9,8,8,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":56},{"Name":"Education","Percent":32},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050401085323","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050401085323","DocDate":"30-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122013585","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122013585","DocURL":"23-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122013585","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122013585","DocDate":"23-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122013886","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122013886","DocDate":"23-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122013886","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122013886","DocURL":"23-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b57a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b57a_1_0","DocDate":"17-FEB-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005121237","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005121237","DocDate":"01-FEB-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005120956","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005120956","DocDate":"01-FEB-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
