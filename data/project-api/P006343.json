The main categories of investment will be street paving, storm drainage, water and electricity distribution, street lighting, sewage disposal facilities, slum upgrading, schools and kindergartens, health posts, community centers and sport grounds. Equipment will be purchased to improve and maintain farm-to-market roads and to expand local stone quarries; vehicles will be procured to convey children to school; and technical assistance will be extended, mainly by state corporations and utility companies. The project is likely to induce rural migrants to settle in these towns, instead of crowding into the larger centers."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"52,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"UM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban management","code":"UM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171020","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171020","DocDate":"17-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925062014","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925062014","DocDate":"26-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925172127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925172127","DocDate":"30-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902421550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902421550","DocDate":"31-AUG-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a1c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a1c_1_0","DocDate":"23-AUG-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a16_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a16_1_0","DocDate":"23-AUG-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901023567","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901023567","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
