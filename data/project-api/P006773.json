It would also strengthen rural road maintenance and FNCV's overall administration. The project consists of: (a) construction of about 710 km of rural roads; (b) rehabilitation of about 710 km; (c) engineering for about 710 km; (d) purchase of hand tools for labor-intensive maintenance; (e) procurement of maintenance equipment and related spare parts; and (f) technical assistance to improve FNCV's management information system. The project faces no unusual risks. The works included under the project are considered to be well within the capability of FNCV. The Working Capital Fund to be set up under the project will ensure the timely availability of financial resources and thus provide for speedy project execution."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Rural roads","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Rural roads"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"TR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Rural roads","code":"TR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925063901","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925063901","DocDate":"28-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97629_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97629_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e97628_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97628_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902371030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902371030","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912522071","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912522071","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
