There are three project components. The first component focuses on controlling tuberculosis with training and education, diagnosis, treatment, public awareness campaigning, and monitoring and evaluation. The second component provides finance to stabilize the epidemiological situation in the country, reduce risky behavior among young people, and reduce the social tension in the society and negative consequences of the epidemic. Specifically, this component finances a pilot project to help Ukraine develop capabilities to treat a limited number of adults and children infected with HIV, with anti-retroviral drugs. The successful implementation of this pilot will help Ukraine access added funds from the Global Alliance. The third component comprises the financing of TB and AIDS control activities in the prison system. It was designed as a separate component because of the institutional nature of the prison system, a self-contained and centrally managed system."},"country_namecode":"Ukraine!$!UA","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"UA","sectorcode":"BC,JB,BG,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"93,88,67","mjthemecode":"8,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":75},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100107232846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100107232846","DocDate":"28-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201512318","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201512318","DocURL":"15-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201512721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201512721","DocDate":"15-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201512318","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201512318","DocDate":"15-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02120404020582","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02120404020582","DocDate":"22-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00071906411277","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00071906411277","DocDate":"20-JUN-2000"}],"countryname":"Ukraine"}},"facets":{}}
