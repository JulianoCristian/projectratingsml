The second component 1) sets up a surface water drainage system that includes pipework to the existing culvert and a treatment plant to treat vehicle spillage and surface water; and 2) installs pipelines to connect the sewage system and the drinking water system, and connects the wholesale market to a gas supply line as well as interfacing with the public electricity and telecommunications networks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"15,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"39","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01070704011982","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01070704011982","DocDate":"19-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041411304817","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041411304817","DocDate":"29-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042014284516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042014284516","DocDate":"29-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980728143210","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980728143210","DocDate":"30-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182617","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182617","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3971104184813","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971104184813","DocDate":"31-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
