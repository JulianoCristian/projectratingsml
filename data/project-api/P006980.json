The main canal capacity would be adequate to serve 40,000 ha, a feature which would allow for future expansion of the project. Project works would include: (a) headworks on the Yaque del Norte river at Santiago de los Caballeros, consisting of a diversion dam, a sluice structure, a desilting works and intake structure; (b) a concrete lined main canal of about 73 km; (c) a distribution system of concrete lined canals with a total length of about 300 km; (d) a drainage system of about 500 km, about half of which would consist of reconditioned natural drains; (e) on-farm irrigation and drainage canals and land leveling; (f) a pumping plant to serve about 1,600 ha above the main canal; and (g) about 375 km of roads along the main and secondary canals."},"country_namecode":"Dominican Republic!$!DO","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"13,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"DO","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901063182","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901063182","DocDate":"20-OCT-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902194223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902194223","DocDate":"31-JAN-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de3520_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de3520_1_0","DocDate":"16-JAN-1973"}],"countryname":"Dominican Republic"}},"facets":{}}
