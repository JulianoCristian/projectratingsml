Disadvantaged children are broadly defined as school-aged children who are not enrolled or are at-risk of not completing their primary education; children who attend schools thatdo not meet fundamental quality standards; and disabled children or children from other highly vulnerable groups, such as street children, migrant children, or girls in certain ethnic minority areas. There are three project components beside the project management component. The first component raises all schools in the 189 most disadvantaged targeted districts to a fundamental school quality level (FSQL) through a two-pronged approach: 1) it provides necessary support to district administration to improve planning, management, and monitoring capabilities; and 2) it enhances school capacity to provide effective instruction at poorly resourced satellite campuses. Specifically, the component strengthens district school data collection systems; supports the development of a district-wide FSQL action plan; procures a teacher's guide, materials, and training modules; provides workshops; places teacher assistants; upgrades infrastructure; and strengthens parents' associations, among other activities. The second component prsents interventions that address the educational needs of disabled children; and addresses the educational needs of vulnerable groups, such as street and working children, children living in fishing communities, and others. The third component assists the Ministry of Education and Training (MoET) to lay down a pathway for reaching national school standards by using FSQL as a first step. It will propose FSQL criteria and raise awareness at all levels of the education system about how to bring ever"},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":2},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"138,760,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Indigenous Peoples Plan,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"BC,EC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"62,78,87,65","mjthemecode":"8,6,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":97},{"Name":"Education","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20110828234820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110828234820","DocDate":"29-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011010112475378","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011010112475378","DocDate":"01-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20100113233208","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100113233208","DocDate":"16-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123594030","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123594030","DocURL":"14-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200534315","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200534315","DocDate":"14-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200534114","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200534114","DocDate":"14-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03042404004720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03042404004720","DocDate":"03-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000094946_03013104014262","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03013104014262","DocDate":"24-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02072404015548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02072404015548","DocDate":"17-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00121906040860","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121906040860","DocDate":"11-DEC-2000"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}},"facets":{}}
