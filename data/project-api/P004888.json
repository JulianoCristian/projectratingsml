Specifically, the project would supply engineers and higher technicians in mechanical engineering, workshop instructors for an expanded network of vocational training centers, and technical/workshop teachers for the civil engineering technology sections of a new network of technicums. The loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of: (a) architectural design, construction, furniture and equipment; (b) 62 man-years of technical assistance for key expatriate staff for the start up of the project institutes; (c) 128 man-years of fellowships to train Algerian staff abroad to replace the expatriate staff; and (d) 7.5 man-years of short-term consultants to prepare studies on the development of (i) a network of training centers and a national institute of rural maintenance trades; (ii) a system of educational radio and television for vocational training; and (iii) a national institute for pedagogical research on vocational training."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925023130","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925023130","DocDate":"08-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e33a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e33a_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902294059","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902294059","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912363336","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912363336","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100215052807","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100215052807","DocDate":"26-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
