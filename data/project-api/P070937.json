The additional financing will address the financing gap arising from the increase in project costs associated with a change in the Government of Uruguay's (GoU) strategy on civil works, and the significant escalation of construction costs in the country. The new civil works strategy will ensure that the Project Development Objectives (PDO) target of 47,000 new student places in Full Time Schools (FTSs) will be met. No changes are to the design or implementation arrangements of the project. The additional financing will continue to finance ongoing activities including: (i) the construction, rehabilitation and equipping o f schools; (ii) the procurement of didactic materials (school equipment, learning materials, and school libraries); (iii) teacher training for FTS; and (iv) project management."},"country_namecode":"Oriental Republic of
