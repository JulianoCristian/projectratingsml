The completion of this contract will increase the likelihood of sustainability by allowing for the: (i) replacement of aged high lift pumps; and (ii) the procurement of necessary spares deemed essential to the continued functioning of the Upper Ruvu and Lower Ruvu plants. Both have been experiencing frequent breakdowns that have disrupted service delivery to Dar es Salaam. Efforts to procure the pumps begin in June 2009, however, there have been significant delays. The borrower first requested the association's approval to proceed with the purchase of the pumps on July 6, 2009. However, the first attempt to procure the pumps failed as quotations from shortlisted suppliers were considered expensive and the proposed delivery period extended beyond the initial project closing date of December 31, 2009. Processing of a second request for bids was therefore suspended until an extension of the project was granted up to June 30, 2010."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of
