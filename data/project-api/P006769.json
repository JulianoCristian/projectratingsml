Maintenance would be improved and obsolete equipment for operation and maintenance would be replaced. Technical assistance would be provided to small farmers and lands in rice districts would be leveled to save water reduce production costs and increase cropping intensity. The project would also strengthen HIMAT's (Instituto Colombiano de Hidrologia, Meteorologia y Adecuacion de Tierras - Colombian Institute for Hydrology, Meteorology and Land Improvement) capacity to appraise and supervise irrigation/drainage projects and train beneficiaries to manage their own irrigation systems. It is expected that the project would benefit about 4,700 farm families, including nearly 1,500 land reform beneficiaries. The major risk is that beneficiaries would be reluctant to adopt technological changes including land leveling, thus delaying or reducing project benefits. This risk, however, is relatively small, and training, technical assistance, access to credit and increased water charges are all expected to encourage farmers to adopt improved farming and irrigation practices."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"37,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e972dd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e972dd_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e972dc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e972dc_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902372048","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902372048","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912533392","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912533392","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100319025709","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100319025709","DocDate":"29-APR-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
