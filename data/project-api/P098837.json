The changes involve: a) an extension of the project closing to complete the on-going road project which is stalled due to insecurity situation in the Blue Nile State; b) reallocation within and among components to: 1) avail funds to institutional development to continue with the capacity building activities; 2) provide additional funding to supervision services to cover the increased cost of supervision, during the extended period of roads contracts execution; and 3) allocate the balance of the Multi Donor Trust Fund for Sudan National Secretariat (MDTF-NS) allocation for the first section of the Damazin-Kurmuk road to the second section of the Damazin- Kurmuk road contract to cover additional financing requirements due to the insecurity, increase in quantities of existing bill items and escalation of prices; c) drop activities that will not be implemented under the NETRP; and d) revision of targets to reflect the changes. The closing date of the project will be extended to June 30, 2013, to allow the completion of ongoing contracts."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the
