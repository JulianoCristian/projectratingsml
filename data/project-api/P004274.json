It will assist the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) and the Public Works Department (PWD) in the provision of roads and water supply works for existing land settlement schemes, and strengthen PWD's construction and waterworks operation and maintenance practices. The project will complement agricultural development of some 105,000 ha and thereby raise living standards and incomes of some 26,000 settler families in Peninsular Malaysia. It will include: (a) construction of about 840 km of access and village roads and 18 bridges; (b) construction of seven water treatment plants, about 90 km of distribution mains, and reservoirs and reticulation systems for 44 settlement villages; and (c) development and implementation of a training program and technical assistance for improvement of waterworks operation and maintenance in the State of Pahang.
