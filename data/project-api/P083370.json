Focusing on strategic areas, the project will have three distinct capacity building objectives: 1) broad-based professional development of public sector officers; 2) capacity enhancement in key ministries and agencies at the forefront of design, implementation and monitoring of policy reforms; and 3) strengthening of regulatory agencies. The Civil Service restructuring is a significant administrative feature of the Civil Service Reforms under the Economic Revival Program of 1999. The first component will address the capacity, and technical skills gap in the civil service, largely focusing on the professional development of federal and provincial civil service, and ex-cadre officers. It will be undertaken through a professional training program, on priority areas for degree programs abroad, and, in-country training capacity through support of training institutions. The civil service recruitment process will be improved through support to the Federal Public Service Commission. The second component will strengthen economic policy and management, through capacity building of key federal and provincial ministries and divisions, including finance, planning, commerce, central board of revenue, etc., who are in the vanguard of design and implementation of the reform agenda. Finally, the third component will support capacity building of the newly established regulatory agencies through a specialized training of officers, and, specialized technical consultancies for analytical studies, and, includes procurement of equipment and related materials. An unallocated amount will be disbursed to interested ministries/agencies, once their individual proposals are approved by the National Steering and Coordination Committee ("},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":76},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"55,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"ET,BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"28,40,25,27,21","mjthemecode":"1,2,2,4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":76},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20131015095558","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20131015095558","DocDate":"29-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2010032314442520","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010032314442520","DocURL":"16-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000021321_2010032314442520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010032314442520","DocDate":"16-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20040430112206","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040430112206","DocDate":"20-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000334955_20090709042052","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090709042052","DocDate":"20-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20040121093103","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040121093103","DocDate":"16-JAN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20040120101732","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040120101732","DocDate":"16-JAN-2004"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
