The project will support institutional and policy reforms of Albania's forest and pasture sector and provide resources for investment in the following five main components: 1) institutional development of the forest/pasture administration including related training, education and research and the establishment of a project environmental management unit; 2) improved management of state forests; 3) rehabilitation of forest roads; 4) management of communal forest and pasture areas; and 5) management of protected areas."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":46},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":41},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"AL","sectorcode":"AB,BC,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,83,26,82","mjthemecode":"11,2,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":46},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":41},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20041217104821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041217104821","DocDate":"30-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123393716","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123393716","DocURL":"03-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123393716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123393716","DocDate":"03-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123393917","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123393917","DocDate":"03-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961022110310","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022110310","DocDate":"15-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022110228","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022110228","DocDate":"15-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970716150121","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716150121","DocDate":"29-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062315274202","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062315274202","DocDate":"15-APR-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Albania"}},"facets":{}}
