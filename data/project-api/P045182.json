The four main components call for: 1) provision of grants to communities, for the construction of water, and sanitation facilities. Furthermore, technical assistance, training, and outreach activities will be financed to strengthen community capacity in the operation and maintenance of those facilities; 2) demand-responsiveness in the rehabilitation of major water supply systems, and establish sustainable management of these systems; 3) strengthening stakeholder capacity to perform the tasks required within the rural water supply, and sanitation strategy, and ensure appropriate services to the community. Thus, the component will support private sector, and non-governmental organizations' in the provision of computer services, and, the public sector will facilitate the sub-sector development, and management process; and, 4) inclusion of incremental project management costs, and technical assistance to community development committees."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":62},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":38},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"WA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,71,85","mjthemecode":"11,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":62},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":38}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080804233018","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080804233018","DocDate":"26-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00082205412366","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082205412366","DocDate":"31-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00051905305043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051905305043","DocDate":"10-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911062746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911062746","DocDate":"21-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185648","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185648","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda"}},"facets":{}}
