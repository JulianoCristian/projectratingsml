In Sindh Province, there are about 42,000 watercourses, of which 17,000 watercourses have so far been improved under various on-farm water management programs, including SOFWMP. In the canal command areas of three Area Water Boards (AWBs) alone, where SOFWMP is being implemented, more than 6,000 watercourses remain unimproved. The GoSindh had a plan to improve all its watercourses by 2010 through the National Program for Improvement of Watercourses (NPIW). But, due to the current economic crisis and funding cuts for NPIW, it is unlikely that the plan will be implemented fully. The Bank's additional financing will meet a significant part of this unmet demand in watercourse improvement."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of
