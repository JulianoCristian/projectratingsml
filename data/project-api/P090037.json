The reallocation is necessary to allow for the scaling up of a number of project activities using existing project savings. More specifically, the Government of Moldova requested the reallocation of proceeds for the following activities: i) the clean-up of the 400 KW Vulcanesti transformer station site; ii) expanding POPs communication and awareness raising activities; iii) additional training for staff of the state Hydrometeo service chemical lab for POPs testing and analysis; iv) additional information technology
