There are seven project components. The first constructs a shiplock and shiplock gates and hoists. The second component constructs a dam and powerhouse; and supplies and installs turbines and power generators, sluice gates, and hydraulic hoists as well as providing trash screens, roof covers, and other small equipment; and provides transformers and a switch yard and builds transmission lines. The third component funds access roads from existing roads to the project site along with access roads within the project complex. The fourth component finances river bank protection works and reservoir area protection. The fifth component upgrades channels. The sixth component strengthens institutional capacity by developing a waterway management strategy and providing for training, a containerization study, and construction supervision. The seventh component finances land acquisition, compensation for resettlement, cleaning of the reservoir area, and other resettlement-related activities."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
