The main objectives are to bring sector investments in line with economic priorities, primarily by: (a) concentrating resources on the preservation of existing roads; (b) strengthening the overall institutional framework by optimizing the use of funds for road resurfacing and maintenance; (c) pursuing efficiency improvements in the road transport market; and (d) pursuing efficiency improvements in the construction industry. The project consists of two components. First, the investment component will consist of a three-year slice of the road investment and maintenance program including: (a) civil works; (b) equipment for road maintenance, traffic counting, workshops and road safety; and (c) studies, technical assistance and overseas training. The adjustment and institutional development component provides a comprehensive time-bound framework for pursuing the key policy and institutional development objectives under the project with particular reference to the organization of the road freight transport market, road user charges and improvements in road maintenance planning."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"79,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,39,78,40","mjthemecode":"4,10,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165820","DocDate":"11-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042910094399","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042910094399","DocDate":"02-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040809402000","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040809402000","DocDate":"15-MAR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928163857","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928163857","DocDate":"08-JAN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928164103","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928164103","DocDate":"08-JAN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100503002337","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100503002337","DocDate":"08-JAN-1990"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
