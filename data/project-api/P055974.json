There are five components. The first consists of flood prevention works, drought mitigation works, and essential equipment such as bailey bridges, temporary power plants, and other equipment needed for managing an emergency response. The second flexibly allocates resources to 1) rehabilitate and rebuild flood-damaged public infrastructure facilities; and 2) regenerate productive capacity in the drought areas by drilling wells, rebuilding small irrigation systems, building earthen dams, and procuring and distributing seeds. The third component provides technical assistance to strengthen the technical operations unit, for sub-project identification and implementation, and for a medium term monitoring and prevention strategy.  The fourth and fifth components consist of a project preparation advance and unallocated funding."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":29},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":19},"sector5":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Flood protection"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"WD,TA,BZ,AI,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Urban development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"39,78,71,52","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,9,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":29},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":29},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":19},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0107110403300","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0107110403300","DocDate":"14-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200594750","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200594750","DocURL":"27-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200594549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200594549","DocDate":"27-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200594148","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200594148","DocURL":"27-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200594549","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200594549","DocURL":"27-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200594750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200594750","DocDate":"27-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200594148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200594148","DocDate":"27-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429111319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429111319","DocDate":"24-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101132","DocDate":"23-JAN-1998"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
