There are 5 components. The first, road rehabilitation and bridge restoration, reinforces the pavement structures of national roads and strengthens, widens, or replaces existing bridges. Component 2 uses performance-based CREMA contracts (contracts for rehabilitation and maintenance) to rehabilitate and maintain road networks. Component 3, funded by the National Directorate of Highway's (DNV), consists of a contract maintenance program and incremental operational costs of force account maintenance activities managed by field districts. Component 4 caries out departmental maintenance subprojects over the project period in the participating departments. The last component 1) strengthens the technical capacity of the ministry of transport and public works in road financing and user-charge areas, strengthens the DNV's institutional and operational capacity, and transfers technology to and strengthens the maintenance management practices of participants in the Departmental Roads Maintenance program; and 2) improves pavement markings and road signs along highways and implements a pilot program for road safety."},"country_namecode":"Oriental Republic of Uruguay!$!UY","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"64,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Agreement,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"UY","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"47,74,39,48,44","mjthemecode":"4,5,4,9,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":94},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000362596_2011121915051653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000362596_2011121915051653","DocDate":"27-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040520143628","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040520143628","DocDate":"10-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200394539","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200394539","DocURL":"06-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200394539","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200394539","DocDate":"06-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903312397","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903312397","DocDate":"25-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3981005112254","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3981005112254","DocDate":"26-AUG-1998"}],"countryname":"Oriental Republic of Uruguay"}},"facets":{}}
