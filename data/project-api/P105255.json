The PRSO reform program focuses on four critical reform pillars: (i) strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency; (ii) improving electricity and gas sector services; (iii) improving the environment for private sector development; and (iv) improving social protection, education, and health care services. The reforms aim at developing a dynamic and competitive private sector as the main engine of growth, with the state playing a supportive role by providing basic public goods and services. These development strategies, reflected in Georgia's poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), have served the country well. Driven by rapidly rising foreign direct investment (FDI) flows of about $1.5 billion per year, which translated into domestic investment of 28 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), GDP growth averaged 10.5 percent per year over the last three years and reached 12.4 percent in 2007. During the same period, inflation was on average 8.7 percent per year, though it accelerated to 11 percent in 2007. Private capital inflows financed the large external current account deficit while international reserves increased from $881 million in 2006 to $1,361 million in 2007, and to $1,550 million by end-July 2008 (or about 2.6 months of imports). At the same time, external debt declined from 46 percent of GDP in 2003 to 16.7 percent in 2007."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"22,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Project Paper,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document","countrycode":"GE","sectorcode":"YZ,JB,LZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"55,29,27,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,2,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20100113015515","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100113015515","DocDate":"23-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2009061014465567","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009061014465567","DocDate":"03-OCT-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2009061014465567","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009061014465567","DocURL":"03-OCT-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20080925030509","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080925030509","DocDate":"19-SEP-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2009061014430825","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009061014430825","DocURL":"12-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2009061014430825","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009061014430825","DocDate":"12-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20080506032109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080506032109","DocDate":"25-APR-2008"}],"countryname":"Georgia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
