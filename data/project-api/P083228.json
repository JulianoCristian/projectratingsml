The credit is the first of a series of three adjustment credits to support the Government of Punjab's medium-term sector-wide reform program to enhance access and quality of education. Punjab is reallocating public expenditures towards education and other pro-poor programs, and implementing national initiatives on decentralization and the accompanying public finance and management reforms, using the education sector as the leading sector. The Government has developed a Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) Strategy that is consistent with the National Education Sector Reform Program. The Punjab ESRP has three pillars: (A) public finance reforms to realign expenditures at the provincial and district level toward education and other pro-poor expenditures; (B) devolution and public sector management reforms; and (C) education sector reforms to improve quality, access, and governance of the education system. These reforms will be fully implemented over a three-year period. The first two pillars of the reforms are also supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the Punjab Resource Management Program (PRMP). The Punjab Government has also developed a Provincial PRSP, which, among other things, supports the devolution of decision making and finances to districts and provides the impetus for public finance and management reforms. These reforms are being undertaken concurrently. As earlier experience in Pakistan shows, education sector reforms cannot be successful without reforms in public finance management and governance.
