This will be achieved by: (i) reducing the risk of sexual, intravenous and vertical transmission of HIV; (ii) improving the health status and quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS; and (iii) mitigating the socio-economic impact of the epidemic on vulnerable groups. The restructuring aims to: (i) separate the functions of the coordinator of the Bank project implementation unit and the coordinator of the national body charged with coordinating HIV/AIDS programs, in order to allow more focus on project implementation and at the same time ensuring sustainability of the national response ; (ii) modify activities under the community component to shift from multiple community micro-projects to community outreach programs using a limited number of large actors ; (iii) revise the project's key indicators and targets to adjust to the revised project activities and address the current difficulties in obtaining some of the data ; and (iv) reallocation of budget categories into a single expenditure category for the uncommitted proceeds of the grant to facilitate disbursement as the project nears completion."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of the Congo!$!ZR","sector1":{"Name":"Other social
