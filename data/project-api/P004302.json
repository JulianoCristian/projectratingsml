The time-slice is estimated as necessary for FRIM to become proficient in new fields of research. Specifically, the project funds an agreed program of research and development activities through the engagement of scientists and experts, on a consulting basis, to supplement the cadre of 50 professional staff already working in FRIM.  The project also funds vehicles, scientific equipment, and infrastructure, including laboratories, office buildings and roads, required to strengthen FRIM's ability to sustain its R & D program, and staff training. The research program has been defined in detail and supports the government's shift in forest research priority away from logging for export to one of conservation, reforestation, environmental protection and domestic processing of timber."},"country_namecode":"Malaysia!$!MY","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MY","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007172528","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007172528","DocDate":"10-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041310364474","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041310364474","DocDate":"14-AUG-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926072644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926072644","DocDate":"13-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Malaysia"}},"facets":{}}
