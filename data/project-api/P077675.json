The additional loan will finance activities started under the Serbia Health Project (SHP) to reform hospital payment methods and improve quality of health care services. The loan will finance the provision: (i) of management information technologies (hardware and software) for hospitals and the Health Insurance Fund (HIF); (ii) of technical assistance to hospitals, the HIF, and the Ministry of Health (MOH) to support institutional and management reforms on a sector and hospital level so that hospitals can react to the new financial incentives set by case-based payment systems such as Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) and eventually improve hospital productivity and efficiency, and (iii) of technical assistance to support monitoring and evaluation of the payment reform within hospitals and the HIF and on a sector level in order to evaluate and adjust the impact of the payment change and to prevent adverse effects and cost escalations. These activities will contribute to the effectiveness and financial sustainability of the health system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
