The project will consist of four components: 1) the National System of Competency Standards, Skills Testing and Certification component which will establish national competency standards defined by workers and employers for 20 key occupational clusters. Based on these new competency standards, a system of skills testing and certification will be established to serve as an objective evaluation tool of both worker skills and training programs; 2) the Modernization of Training Program will help selected training institutions, both public and private, redesign their training courses into modular courses based on the new competency standards, providing for teaching materials development, instructor retraining, and equipment updating; 3) the Stimulation of Demand for Competency-Based Training and Certification component will promote the benefits of the new system of competency standards and certification to potential users of the system; and 4) the Information Systems, Studies and Project Administration component will support establishment of registries of data pertaining to the new training and certification system for monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican
