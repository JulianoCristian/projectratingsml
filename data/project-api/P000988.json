To support the Government's major policy objectives for educational development, the project will upgrade the quality and increase access to education. This will be accomplished in two ways. Firstly, the project will improve the content and relevance of the primary education curriculum and teaching materials and improve pre-service and in-service primary teacher training programs. To the same end, the project will strengthen the teacher inspectorate services, train 3,000 primary teachers, and rehabilitate dilapidated primary schools. Secondly, the project will develop the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECD) by establishing an efficient organizational structure for MECD and providing basic office equipment, materials and improved physical facilities. Finally, the project will introduce budgetary and efficiency measures to reduce costs and link expenditures to educational development priorities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea-Bissau!$!GW","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"4,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GW","sectorcode":"ET,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"65,30","mjthemecode":"2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":68},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970619110738","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970619110738","DocDate":"31-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120381867","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120381867","DocURL":"16-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120381466","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120381466","DocDate":"16-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120380265","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120380265","DocURL":"16-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120381466","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120381466","DocURL":"16-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120381867","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120381867","DocDate":"16-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120380265","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120380265","DocDate":"16-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08284_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08284_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926174122","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926174122","DocDate":"18-MAY-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea-Bissau"}},"facets":{}}
