The closing date for the project will be extended from June 30, 2011 until January 31, 2012. Activities in project components are progressing well and project objectives continue to be achievable. The project development objective and overall implementation progress are rated as moderately satisfactory and satisfactory, respectively. The framework for creating a conductive environment for private sector growth has been initiated. A trade and investment policy and a national microfinance policy were prepared and are in the process of being finalized, a draft mining bill and accompanying regulations have been completed, and five trade-related bills have been drafted. An industrial competitiveness strategy has also been completed. In the area of access to finance and building entrepreneurship among Southern Sudanese, loan able funds and technical assistance for capacity building have been availed to microfinance institutions and block collateral has been provided for loans from Kenya Commercial Bank-Sudan to 44 entrepreneurs who emerged winners in the business plan competition. The collateral will eventually be turned into equity for the entrepreneurs who successfully pay off the initial loans. In terms of disbursements, the project has disbursed US$7.58 million out of a total of US$8.46 million, representing a disbursement rate of 90 percent.
