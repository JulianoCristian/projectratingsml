The project aims to achieve this through financing credit to private farmers and other private businesses for: (a) the establishment and expansion of rural enterprises; and (b) on-farm investment.  The loan will finance private investment in viable agricultural and other rural businesses through a credit line expected to take five years to disburse.  It is intended to be wide ranging and demand led excluding those ineligible subsectors which are assessed not to be economically viable.  It will cover both investment items and incremental working capital for:  (a) agricultural production including certain types of livestock agricultural machinery and related services; (b) processing of agricultural products, particularly small- and medium-scale investment to increase value added in the rural areas; (c) marketing and trade of agricultural products, especially for transport, wholesaling and retailing of both agricultural outputs and inputs; and (d) other rural businesses."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":47},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":36},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"FE,YB,YA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"75,76","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":47},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":36},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200090295","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200090295","DocURL":"15-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200090295","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200090295","DocDate":"15-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200090194","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200090194","DocURL":"15-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200090396","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200090396","DocDate":"15-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200090396","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200090396","DocURL":"15-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200090194","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200090194","DocDate":"15-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003000026","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003000026","DocDate":"18-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052712450437","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052712450437","DocDate":"04-FEB-1992"}],"countryname":"Romania","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
