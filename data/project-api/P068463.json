The project expands access to and improves the quality of services that address young children's basic needs. There are five project components. The first improves child health by providing on-the-job and pre-service training to health workers and caregivers; financing drugs, medical equipment, and supplies and strengthening procurement, storage, and distribution mechanisms; promoting adoption of healthy practices such as breastfeeding and the correct treatment of infections; using environmental health interventions to control childhood illnesses; and improving communications for behavioral change; The second component builds capacities for families and communities for improving the nutritional and health status of children, by reducing micro- and macro-nutrient deficiency and improving food security; and builds capacity within ministries to implement the nutrition component. The third component improves quality and access to early childhood education, and institutional capacity at all administrative levels. The fourth component strengthens the traditional safety nets for child care and protection through community-based reintegration and pycho-social support for orphans. Beside supporting the over-all management of the multi-sectoral program, the fifth component funds advocacy and sensitization campaigns and establishes an innovation fund."},"country_namecode":"State of Eritrea!$!ER","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":23},"sector4":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Agreement,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ER","sectorcode":"BZ,EP,EC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"themecode":"63,54,65,51,68","mjthemecode":"8,6,8,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":35},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25},{"Name":"Education","Percent":23},{"Name":"Education","Percent":13},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2010102715141513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010102715141513","DocDate":"29-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080303030512","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080303030512","DocDate":"31-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030409435182","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030409435182","DocDate":"31-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0006020538277","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0006020538277","DocDate":"15-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9911240531145","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9911240531145","DocDate":"16-FEB-2000"}],"countryname":"State of Eritrea"}},"facets":{}}
