The two main components are: 1) Investments in civil works, which will include the rehabilitation of breakwaters at the port entrance, through detailed investigations, and, build an extension of both the northern, and southern breakwaters, to limit wave energy from entering the port. In addition, the channel entrance will be dredged, widened, and deepened, allowing a realignment away from the oil terminal, in accordance with international agreements. Specifically designed monitoring fenders will be installed, combined with steel mooring lines. Safe maneuvers will be ensured following the installation of a wave/current monitoring system. Studies will determine the requirements for marine environment protection, and the financing of necessary equipment, and training. 2) Technical assistance will be provided, through studies to estimate the appropriate level of land lease rates, to avoid cross subsidies with harbor dues, and review lease management contracting, and procurement procedures, and, will focus on privatization practices for port services, and management. Training will be provided for port pilots on skillful navigation practices."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Lithuania!$!LT","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"35,360,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"LT","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,39,84","mjthemecode":"11,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000356161_20100805032327","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20100805032327","DocDate":"17-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20090820020913","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090820020913","DocDate":"24-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200460607","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200460607","DocURL":"03-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200460506","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200460506","DocURL":"03-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0004200542420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0004200542420","DocDate":"10-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00031605303373","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00031605303373","DocDate":"30-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00031605303474","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00031605303474","DocDate":"30-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99111305443540","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99111305443540","DocDate":"30-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052810231399","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052810231399","DocDate":"30-MAR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Lithuania"}},"facets":{}}
