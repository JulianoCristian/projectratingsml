A subsidiary objective is to increase productivity in the road and port sectors and improve efficiency while reducing subsidies to the national rail carrier (AFE) through private sector participation in the operations of forest products transport.  The project's components are as follows: 1) infrastructure and equipment component for the road network, AFE's track, pier extensions, transfer stations and departmental roads maintenance; and 2) institutional and policy development component including AFE reorganization, increase in private sector participation, road user charges, trucking industry study, economic, engineering and
