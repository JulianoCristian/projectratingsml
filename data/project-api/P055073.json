The goal is to develop flexible systems and procedures for delivering technical support services and financing to providers/beneficiaries which permit scaling-up to a larger country-wide constituency. The project has three components. The first component, testing functional literacy programs, funds the selection of sub-projects proposed by provider/beneficiary groups that are community developed, and provides technical support to nongovernmental organizations to build staff capacity in all required areas of expertise while creating an operational network of resource institutions. The second component develops and tests essential strategies for post-literacy to ensure the scaling up and sustainability of the program. It finances the preparation and broadcasting of post-literacy programs. Component 3 finances project management, supervision, and evaluation. It establishes an autonomous institution with government sponsorship, the National Fund to Assist Literacy (FNAA), which receives and manages public, private, and donor funds. This institution provides technical support and financing to non-governmental literacy, and develops and field tests required systems and procedures."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire!$!CI","sector1":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":54},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":46},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CI","sectorcode":"JB,EL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,61,65,57,78","mjthemecode":"10,7,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":54},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":46}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050623100013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050623100013","DocDate":"16-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201091832","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201091832","DocURL":"05-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9907270943130","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9907270943130","DocDate":"09-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99081506040880","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99081506040880","DocDate":"29-MAR-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire"}},"facets":{}}
