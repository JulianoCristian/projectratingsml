Specific objectives will be: (a) to strengthen institutional capacity to lead the reform process and achieve specific improvements in justice services delivery, in particular in the Judiciary and in selected project districts; (b) to establish human resource management systems that ensure independence, transparency and integrity; and (c) to enhance access to justice services for the Peruvian society, in particular the poor (the three main components beside project management).  The three main components have an interrelated national and regional focus. The Justice Services Delivery component will support central as well as regional planning, plus court administration and operation improvements. It will focus initially on 4 selected judicial districts, which are representative of the variety of the Peruvian demand for justice services, including such factors as workload and social and demographic aspects (poverty indicators o f beneficiary populations, access needs, proportion of indigenous populations). While the Justice Services Delivery component includes both national and regional level support, the Judicial Human Resource Professional Development component is national in scope, as is the Enhanced Access to Justice component. Both these two components include broad policy aspects and promote inter-institutional coordination to improve the supply of justice services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Mejoramiento de los servicios de justicia</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Access to law and justice","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rule of law","Public sector governance","Rule of law"],"themecode":"31,26,32,57,25","mjthemecode":"2,7,3,2,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Access to law and justice","code":"31"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000370910_20110215094756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000370910_20110215094756","DocDate":"25-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2010041616012594","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010041616012594","DocDate":"30-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2006052611193794","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2006052611193794","DocURL":"30-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20040305104653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040305104653","DocDate":"05-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20040217094954","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040217094954","DocDate":"09-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20031113095455","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20031113095455","DocDate":"10-NOV-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
