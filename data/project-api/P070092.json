The credit amount is fully committed and all activities under the project will be completed by the current closing date of October 31, 2010. The outcomes and outputs recorded in the recent Implementation Status and Results (ISRs) reveal that the impact of the project has been consistent with the expectation set out in the Project Paper. The ISR ratings for both the implementation progress and development objectives have been satisfactory. The reallocation is required mainly to offset the deficit in the consultancy category as a result of inclusion of a study to prepare detailed plans, engineering designs and bidding documents for priority flood protection investments and an integrated storm water management plan. The study was initiated in response to a request from the government based on which an allocation of US$30 million was included in the 2009 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to cover the investment costs for priority flood protection works that would come out from this study."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"Flood
