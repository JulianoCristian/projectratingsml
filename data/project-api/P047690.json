The project components call for: a) the development of program and policy coordination, to manage technology systems, and coordinate public sector support for agricultural research, and extension, in addition to facilitating institutional reforms; b) the establishment of an agricultural technology fund, to co-finance adaptive research, and extension projects, based on competitive bases, to be selected regionally. Farmers and research/extension institutions, - private sector participants, government technical institutions, or non-governmental organizations - will co-finance projects to be implemented at regional, and community levels; c) an increased capacity building, for the development of strategic programs, within national technology systems. Training and information systems regarding institutional analyses, and planning for selected programs of applied, and strategic research, and extension, will be provided; and, d) development grants, to finance additional projects on a competitive basis, are envisaged."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":71},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":29},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"9,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,57,78,83,77","mjthemecode":"10,11,10,7,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":71},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":29}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20090818025823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090818025823","DocDate":"30-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20051229160548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051229160548","DocDate":"19-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031710144350","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031710144350","DocDate":"20-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99111006010582","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99111006010582","DocDate":"25-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9903191107395","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903191107395","DocDate":"07-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061111050035","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061111050035","DocDate":"21-OCT-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
