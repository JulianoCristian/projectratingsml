It is aimed at improving production technologies for foodcrops, cash crops, livestock and fisheries; strengthening resource management capabilities in agriculture and related fields; and developing a model county extension station to be replicated nationwide.  Principal features of the project will be construction and renovation of laboratories, offices, farm buildings and staff housing; scientific and farm equipment needed for research and experimentation; library equipment, books and materials.  The project will also include local and overseas training in the agricultural sciences and library science; and technical assistance (about 96 man months) applied to review of center research programs, program formulation for extension stations, and future project preparation."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u519c\u4e1a\u6559\u80b2\u79d1\u7814\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5bf9\u9009\u5b9a\u768415\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u4f5c\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u5730\u533a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ee5\u53ca10\u4e2a\u519c\u6280\u63a8\u5e7f\u7ad9\u8fdb\u884c\u5347\u7ea7\u6539\u9020\uff0c\u5176\u5b97\u65e8\u662f\u6539\u8fdb\u7cae\u98df\u4f5c\u7269\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f5c\u7269\u3001\u755c\u7267\u4e1a\u548c\u6e14\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u519c\u4e1a\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u53bf\u7ea7\u793a\u8303\u519c\u6280\u63a8\u5e7f\u7ad9\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u5168\u56fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u65b0\u5efa\u6216\u7ffb\u4fee\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3001\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u3001\u519c\u573a\u5efa\u7b51\u548c\u804c\u5de5\u4f4f\u623f\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u79d1\u6280\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u519c\u7528\u8bbe\u5907\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u56fe\u4e66\u548c\u8d44\u6599\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u5f00\u5c55\u519c\u4e1a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u56fd\u5185\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u57f9\u8bad\uff1b\uff085\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u6280\u672f\u63f4\u52a9\uff08\u7ea696\u4e2a\u4eba\u6708\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5ba1\u9605\u5404\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u519c\u6280\u63a8\u5e7f\u7ad9\u5236\u5b9a\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u51c6\u5907\u4eca\u540e\u9879\u76ee\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Research"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"AR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Research","code":"AR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05ca2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05ca2_1_0","DocDate":"11-SEP-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151029","DocDate":"31-AUG-1984"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
