The project consists o f six components, which in combination will fund key innovations in horizontal management processes and capacity building in specific institutions in the Armenian Public Administration. The ministry and agency-specific interventions aim to have a demonstrative effect and are expected to generate further reforms in other ministries. The components related to horizontal management processes focus on strengthening Civil Service Management, introducing e-Procurement, Financial Oversight by strengthening the Chamber of Control (the supreme audit institution), Policy Management and local level policy implementation. Ministry and Agency specific components focus on the Office o f the Government, the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministry o f Economic Development and Trade and four selected agencies working in the area o f standardization, certification and Metrology. These components assist the government in addressing weaknesses in the policy formulation and implementation process in the central state administration, in particular through the development of electronic document management systems and systems for tracking policy implementation. In addition the project will pilot other public management innovations to enhance transparency and accountability and address priority capacity building needs in selected institutions (the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, and the Office of the Government)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Armenia!$!AM","sector1":{"Name":"Central government
