The project will provide efficient and sustainable water and sanitation services in Yemen's urban areas through: a) increase in urban water supplies initially through improved operation and reduction of water losses (phase one), and subsequently, through development of new water resources including the reuse of wastewater (phase two); b) improvement of sector management through establishment of financially viable regional corporations with significant participation of the private sector; and c) provision of affordable sewerage facilities that assure protection of the environment and permit the reuse of wastewater for agriculture or artificial recharge. The project is entering its final year of implementation. The project management unit (PMU) is working diligently to ensure that all ongoing and planned activities are completed during the final year of implementation without the delays that have affected the project in previous years."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":45},"sector3":{"Name":"Central
