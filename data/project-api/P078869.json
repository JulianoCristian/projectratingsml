A key aspect of the proposed program is the design of a multi pronged effort to first dispose of the financial system's residual loan assets by developing more agile and modern financial instruments and fiduciary arrangements to package, and sell loan assets. The project also aims to strengthen and diversify the participation of the housing mortgage market including improved access to finance for the micro sector, as well as strengthening non bank financial services, and securities institutions in the financial system. The securitization industry will be further developed to support bank asset sales, to provide more liquidity to the mortgage industry, and to help develop the capital markets. A reform of the entire securities legislation will be conducted as part of the program's second phase, to promote a more agile development of the local capital market. This will involve reforming corporate governance and disclosure standards as well as proper criteria for securities industry participants."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Housing finance","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"International financial architecture","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Capital markets"},{"Name":"Housing finance"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"FD,FC,FK,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,46,40,38,34","mjthemecode":"3,4,4,5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"},{"name":"Housing finance","code":"FC"},{"name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","code":"FD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"International financial architecture","code":"46"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":40},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":30},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000310607_20070810111534","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070810111534","DocDate":"26-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20031230141235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20031230141235","DocDate":"22-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202195361","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202195361","DocURL":"28-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202195361","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202195361","DocDate":"28-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000094946_03041004024443","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03041004024443","DocDate":"03-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03060504061247","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03060504061247","DocDate":"21-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03041004025748","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03041004025748","DocDate":"21-MAR-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
