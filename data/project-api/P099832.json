The risk of avian influenza remains an ongoing concern but recent outbreaks of African Swine Fever (ASF) and concurrent zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis are deemed to be of equal relevance and are now a high priority for the government. This paper is based on a formal request from the minister of agriculture indicating the pressing need to broaden the scope of the project to cover other animal and public health issues. The ongoing epidemic of ASF, which began in April, 2007, is causing substantial economic losses affecting the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and the incomes of medium sized swine enterprises. The required changes in the project essentially involve a revision to the project's development objectives to allow the project to encompass some of these other pressing issues yet preserve the integrity of the original project design related to avian influenza. Many of the project activities that are intended to control avian influenza are also effective approaches for the prevention and control of other animal diseases of public health concern. These activities include disease surveillance, information systems, compensation funds, communication, etc."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Armenia!$!AM","sector1":{"Name":"General public
