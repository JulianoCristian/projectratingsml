Since teak is one of the principal export commodities, the project is designed to address the unique and immediate transport problems pertaining to timber distribution. The project would include improvements in specific roads and rail lines, provision and rehabilitation of rolling stock, and consolidation and upgrading of log depots and loading stations. Innovative cost-effective measures include containerization of forestry products, use of push tug and barges in river systems and more efficient shipside loading of lumber. In addition to technical assistance and training, a Comprehensive Study would be undertaken to identify and address long-term issues of timber distribution in Burma."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar!$!MM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other transportation","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"17,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other transportation"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MM","sectorcode":"TY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other transportation","code":"TY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e061cb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e061cb_1_0","DocDate":"20-JUN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094934","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094934","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970723103052","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970723103052","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar"}},"facets":{}}
