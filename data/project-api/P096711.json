The objective of the PFDPLs is to support three policy areas: (i) further improve the business environment to encourage new business and to attract foreign direct investments (FDI); (ii) strengthen financial discipline by enhancing hard budget constraints in the enterprise sector through privatization or bankruptcy, of large Socially-Owned Enterprise (SOE), and the restructuring of public utilities; and (iii) build a more efficient and stable financial sector through continuing the divestment of state ownership in the banking and insurance sectors, enhancing prudential supervision of banking and encouraging development of the capital markets.  The PFDPL is designed to support the government in advancing its financial and private sector related reforms. It is envisioned to be complemented by another Development Policy Loan (DPL) operation aimed at supporting Serbia's public expenditure management. The policy actions set in the PFDPL program will largely conclude the era of fast-track transition reforms in private and financial sectors of the Serbian economy. The private and financial sector reforms outside the PFDPL context will require a shift from immediate, near-term needs to medium- and longer-term results."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Serbia!$!YF","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":63},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":13},"sector3":{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":12},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":63},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"YF","sectorcode":"BC,FD,FA,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"43,40,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","code":"FD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":63},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":13},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20110801003551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110801003551","DocDate":"17-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20090212231601","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090212231601","DocDate":"04-FEB-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000020953_20081217154024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20081217154024","DocDate":"01-JAN-2008"}],"countryname":"Republic of Serbia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
