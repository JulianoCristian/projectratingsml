This is the second reallocation of proceeds of the project. The project continues to play an important role in improving the quality and implementation of power and energy policy reforms; strengthening institutional capacity in the Power and Energy Ministry, the utilities and the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC); preparing and promoting investment projects; and improving the quality of power generation transactions in the public and the private sectors. This restructuring reallocates XDR 230,000 of credit funds to categories originally identified to be financed only through grant funds, to cover shortfall of funds for committed contracts. In addition, a number of new, relatively small, contracts are also approved to be financed through the credit funds. Of the original credit and grant amounts of $15.5m, 81 percent has already been disbursed. Of the balance, the grant funds are fully committed and expected to be disbursed by the project closing date of December 31, 2012; committed contracts financed through credit funds are also expected to be completed by the closing date. A few additional activities are currently under procurement and some of them are expected to be completed by the closing date. Of the original credit and grant amounts of $15.5m, 81 percent has already been disbursed.
