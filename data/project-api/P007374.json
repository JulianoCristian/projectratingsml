The project comprises: (a) an underground investigation program with deep rock borings with corresponding instrumentation, followed by high pressure injection of sealants into the rock mass; (b) impermeabilization of the power plant sump, construction of about 300m of additional drainage galleries to evacuate filtrations by gravity flow, and plugging of the diversion tunnel; (c) installation of additional electrical and mechanical equipment to substantially increase service reliability of the auxiliary electrical system of the power plant; (d) supply and installation of new and complementary instrumentation to monitor foundation pressures and water filtrations; (e) consulting services to:  (i) supervise the impermeabilization works; (ii) carry out a structural and electro-mechanical review of the dam; and (iii) prepare an emergency preparedness and evaluation plan; and (f) training of ENEE staff in underground investigations, pressure sealing of foundations, monitoring of hydrostatic foundation pressures and water leakages in high dams and electrical system stability."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Renewable energy"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"BC,LE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,78","mjthemecode":"10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214165104","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214165104","DocDate":"08-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121574695","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121574695","DocURL":"19-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121574896","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121574896","DocDate":"19-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121574695","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121574695","DocDate":"19-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121574896","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121574896","DocURL":"19-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1251e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1251e_1_0","DocDate":"04-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1251c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1251c_1_0","DocDate":"04-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003014647","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003014647","DocDate":"10-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003014505","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003014505","DocDate":"10-JUL-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras"}},"facets":{}}
