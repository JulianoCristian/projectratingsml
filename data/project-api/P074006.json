By prioritizing areas in infrastructure, such as roads, social infrastructure and private sector rehabilitation, the credit will benefit the jump-start of the economy, and create conditions for long-term development, while tackling immediate economic and social needs of the most vulnerable, i.e., employment creation. Specifically, the project will benefit local entrepreneurs, and national consulting firms, and improve living conditions. Nonetheless, political and social risks, associated with the failure of the transition process to democracy, and to building a political system that will resolve differences without recourse to violence, may hinder success, in addition to weak institutional, and administrative capacities, and the Government's inability to service its debt with the Bank. However, the project will use simplified implementation arrangements, and streamline procurement processes, as well as provide support to the upcoming Public Expenditures Review, to mitigate risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Congo!$!CG","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":33},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":27},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Procurement Plan,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CG","sectorcode":"BZ,JA,JB,TA,TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Social protection and risk management","Human development","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"58,39,88,51,71","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"9,6,8,4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":33},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":27},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000334955_20080512084055","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080512084055","DocDate":"01-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070829120010","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070829120010","DocDate":"25-JUL-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201290970","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201290970","DocURL":"10-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201290970","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201290970","DocDate":"10-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_02041704244313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02041704244313","DocDate":"08-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02012510021082","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02012510021082","DocDate":"17-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01072006081859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072006081859","DocDate":"17-JUL-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Congo","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
