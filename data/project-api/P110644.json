More specifically, the project has two components: the first component being strengthening the capacity of DAB; and the second component is the Development of basic infrastructure in the financial sector. The project, with funding totaling SDR5.5 million (equivalent to US$8 million), was approved on April 30, 2009 and became effective on June 18, 2009. The project's implementation progress and disbursement have been very slow, due to delays in procurement and an overly ambitious project design. Because of the constraints and challenges facing the project, the Government of Afghanistan (GOA) requested the cancellation of SDR4 million as of December 7, 2013. Therefore, this paper seeks approval for the cancellation of SDR4 million from IDA grant No. H-4840."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of
