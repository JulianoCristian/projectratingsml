Project includes: (a) construction of water supply systems via household connections and standpipes; (b) construction of individual waste disposal solutions; (c) implementation of a community health education program; and (d) implementation of technical assistance and training program for SENASA. The main risk is related to the still limited implementation capabilities of SENASA. However, SENASA's record under the previous project has been improving at a satisfactory rate and the risk in question is not excessive. To hold it to a reasonable level, a strong technical assistance program is included."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Paraguay!$!PY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Rural water supply and sanitation","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Rural water supply and sanitation"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PY","sectorcode":"WR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Rural water supply and sanitation","code":"WR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925074547","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925074547","DocDate":"28-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97317_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97317_1_0","DocDate":"16-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902375120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902375120","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912534716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912534716","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Paraguay"}},"facets":{}}
