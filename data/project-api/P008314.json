There are two project components comprising several sub-components. Component 1 a) rehabilitates the heat transmission and distribution network by installing pre-insulated pipes, modern ball and butterfly valves, compensators, and thermal insulation; b) assembles and installs 1, 097 sub-stations; and c) provides technical assistance through Sofia private sector participation consulting services, consultants that update a financial management system, and consultants who will launch a public awareness campaign, and it supports additional designs and supervision, auditing costs, and incremental operating costs. Component 2 a) supports the cost of assembling 700 sub-stations and helps purchase additional components like heat exchangers and pumps for the sub-stations; b) finances the replacement of heat transmission pipes with pre-insulated pipes and supports the purchase of variable speed pumps and monitoring systems for the district heating network; c) supports the replacement of an old and outdated electrostatic precipitator for a boiler in the lignite fired Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant; and d) provides technical assistance for a public awareness campaign, and design and supervision, as well as funding auditing costs, incremental operating costs, and maintenance of the financial management system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"34,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BG","sectorcode":"LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development"],"themecode":"74","mjthemecode":"9,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20090220045402","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090220045402","DocDate":"30-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200450260","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200450260","DocURL":"18-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200450864","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200450864","DocURL":"18-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200450663","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200450663","DocURL":"18-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200450461","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200450461","DocURL":"18-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03052804035533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052804035533","DocDate":"22-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000112742_20030605160940","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20030605160940","DocDate":"22-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02013004043030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02013004043030","DocDate":"31-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229181820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229181820","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Bulgaria"}},"facets":{}}
