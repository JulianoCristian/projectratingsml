The operation will help the Government to maintain macroeconomic stability while it continues to pursue a reform agenda that cannot be fully financed from domestic sources. The reforms will enable Mozambique to make further progress in reducing absolute poverty, improving the delivery of services and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The alignment with the general budget support programs of 18 other donors and a joint focus on the priorities set out by the Government in its comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, and on a common set of indicators to measure progress, should help improve the resource flow and improve aid effectiveness, thereby enhancing the chances of progress towards the MDGs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Quatri\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-4)</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le quatri\u00e8me Cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-4) est le second d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de PRSC destin\u00e9s \u00e0 aider le Gouvernement mozambicain \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre les initiatives d\u2019orientation cl\u00e9s dont il est fait mention dans son second Plan d\u2019action pour la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 absolue (connu sous son acronyme portugais de PARPA II) et dans le Cadre d\u2019\u00e9valuation des performances.
