Within the student loan component, the project will finance institutionally-sponsored student loans to support management development in key institutions, covering higher level human resource development for both the public and private sectors.  Another component is to promote and support the development of high caliber professionals for Venezuela's socio-economic development.  The project will also support operational and policy studies that will feed into the dialogue on improving the finance and efficiency of higher education."},"country_namecode":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela!$!VE","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"58,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"VE","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25","mjthemecode":"2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00081005305360","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081005305360","DocDate":"27-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200090899","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200090899","DocURL":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200090900","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200090900","DocURL":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200091101","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200091101","DocURL":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200090698","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200090698","DocURL":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200091302","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200091302","DocURL":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200091101","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200091101","DocDate":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200090698","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200090698","DocDate":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200090899","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200090899","DocDate":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200090900","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200090900","DocDate":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200091302","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200091302","DocDate":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002171043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002171043","DocDate":"27-MAY-1992"}],"countryname":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela"}},"facets":{}}
