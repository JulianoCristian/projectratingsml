Uganda's reform program under the Second PRSC will be implemented through: a) efficient and equitable use of public resources; b) improved governance through cross-cutting public sector reforms; c) promotion of enabling environment for rural development; and d) improved access to and quality of education, health care, and water and sanitation services. The reforms supported will strengthen the institutional infrastructure needed to improve the public sector's capacity to carry out its role more effectively, as envisioned in the Poverty Eradication Action Plan and the PRSP. Improved delivery of public services is essential if the Government is to reach its goals for poverty reduction and improve the quality of life in Uganda. Risks under the reform program include: institutional and human capacity weaknesses, corruption, and fiduciary risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Other social
