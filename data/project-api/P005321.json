The project will support the adjustment program through: a) water measurement and management in the Jordan Valley; b) groundwater basin monitoring and cotrol; c) strengthening research; d) developing extension; and e) carrying out monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of the adjustment program. The first component will help improve water measurement and management in the Jordan Valley. Under the second component, the Government is adopting a program to move towards sustainable groundwater abstraction nationwide, and implementing a full management program to meter and control all groundwater production, supply and usage. Under the remaining components, the project will strengthen the key agricultural support services of research and extension to enable them to better advise producers on optimizing productivity in response to changing price signals during adjustment."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"6,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"JO","sectorcode":"AB,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,85,27","mjthemecode":"2,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":75},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000094946_03031804015520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03031804015520","DocDate":"31-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01062804081862","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01062804081862","DocDate":"16-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123061942","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123061942","DocURL":"19-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123061942","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123061942","DocDate":"19-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d60_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d60_1_0","DocDate":"08-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961007134211","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007134211","DocDate":"18-NOV-1994"}],"countryname":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan"}},"facets":{}}
