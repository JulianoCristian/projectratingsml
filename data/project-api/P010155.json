The project also includes subsector studies and project preparation in support of the credit component. The Credit would provide US$26 million for onlending to the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) for refinancing loans by five commercial banks, and US$4 million for the technical assistance components. Project risks relate mainly to dealing with institutions that are new to the Association. Monitoring by IDBP of the credit component and technical assistance to the small industries corporations should reduce these risks."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"IL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","code":"IL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04576_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04576_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04574_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04574_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04573_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04573_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04572_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04572_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04570_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04570_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912521563","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912521563","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190236583","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190236583","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
