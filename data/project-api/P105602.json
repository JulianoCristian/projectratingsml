This restructuring will extend the closing date of the project from December 31, 2013 till February 28, 2014. The extension is required to complete implementation of the contract for delivery of information technology (IT) equipment for operation of civil service register at the local level. Implementation of the civil service register is close to completion and is expected to contribute to institutionalization of civil service management, which is one of the project development objective (PDO) indicators under the project results framework. The register is expected to become operational in January 2014. The equipment in question is essential for rolling out the civil service register system to government agencies and for assuring sustainability of the register."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"6,150,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Agreement,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Agreement,Implementation Status and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Project Paper,Project Paper","countrycode":"MD","sectorcode":"BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,30","mjthemecode":"2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20140709090213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20140709090213","DocDate":"30-JUN-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b08210a08a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08210a08a_1_0","DocDate":"07-DEC-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081b0103b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081b0103b_1_0","DocDate":"24-APR-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000356161_20130327113828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130327113828","DocDate":"11-MAR-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081893bd2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081893bd2_1_0","DocDate":"20-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012101310413549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012101310413549","DocDate":"13-OCT-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012040818070382","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012040818070382","DocDate":"08-APR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011100215413472","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011100215413472","DocDate":"02-OCT-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000362596_2011063011544429","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000362596_2011063011544429","DocDate":"30-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011031418234596","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011031418234596","DocDate":"14-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2011010313121297","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2011010313121297","DocDate":"13-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2011010313065013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2011010313065013","DocDate":"13-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20101212234430","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20101212234430","DocDate":"05-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20101212233625","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20101212233625","DocDate":"01-DEC-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Moldova"}},"facets":{}}
