At the national level the project builds the capacity of the health ministry to evaluate and disseminate results of the pilot countrywide. There are four components including project management. The other three components 1) strengthen primary health care services by providing basic diagnostic, therapeutic, and laboratory equipment, furnishings, medical supplies and laboratory reagents, vehicles, and a packet radio communication system in selected locales, along with equipment, training, and foreign and local technical assistance; 2) develop a faculty department in a medical institute, and training programs for trainers, practicing physicians, and nurses as well as reform medical education while introducing a new accreditation process for medical training institutions and the certification and licensing of physicians; 3) strengthen finance and management by system development and pilot testing rationalization strategies, accompanied by a pilot demonstration evaluation and roll-out. Civil works and the provision of goods and services are also financed."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uzbekistan!$!UZ","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":89},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"UZ","sectorcode":"BH,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Rural development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"69,78,67","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":89},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050706121820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050706121820","DocDate":"17-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200394942","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200394942","DocURL":"16-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200394942","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200394942","DocDate":"16-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200394741","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200394741","DocDate":"16-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200394741","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200394741","DocURL":"16-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200395143","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200395143","DocURL":"16-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200395143","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200395143","DocDate":"16-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3981005095739","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3981005095739","DocDate":"27-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182640","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061015334604","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061015334604","DocDate":"20-SEP-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uzbekistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
