The extension is necessary to complete the ongoing Treasury System (FTAS) roll-out in all 83 regions, including the largest regions/cities in the country, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg (the Bank's experience in similar projects in many other countries would help the Federal Treasury (FT) in overcoming challenges that are likely to come up in these specific implementations); and ensure the successful completion of ongoing/remaining contracts for FTAS implementation over the course of the next 18 months (with remaining commitments worth about $100m, the Bank's continued supervision of FTAS implementation will help ensure that the elements of the Information and Communication (ICT) infrastructure are implemented smoothly and FTAS becomes fully functional by project end). This will be the third extension of the closing date of the project."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rule of law","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"231,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000524901","geoLocName":"Moscow","latitude":"55.75222","longitude":"37.615559","country":"RU"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,37","mjthemecode":"3,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rule of law","code":"37"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20130115153442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130115153442","DocDate":"20-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012082417061819","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012082417061819","DocDate":"24-AUG-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012040818033380","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012040818033380","DocDate":"08-APR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20101222002307","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101222002307","DocDate":"15-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20101222002530","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101222002530","DocDate":"15-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201503181","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201503181","DocDate":"31-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201503181","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201503181","DocURL":"31-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201503080","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201503080","DocDate":"31-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02052204040191","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02052204040191","DocDate":"07-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02030704010989","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02030704010989","DocDate":"01-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99111305442037","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99111305442037","DocDate":"27-MAY-1999"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
