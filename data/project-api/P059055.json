The primary objectives are to 1) support Tajikistan's government in its efforts to mitigate the economic and social effects of the floods by immediately repairing or rebuilding essential infrastructure; 2) establish the conditions for a rapid and effective resumption of economic exchanges and growth in the rural areas affected; and 3) help reduce the risk of future occurrence of similar damages. The project has two components. Transport infrastructure provides for the repair or reconstruction of about nine bridges and sections of damaged roads in various regions of the country, including the reconstruction of embankment protections (using labor-intensive work methods) in the proximity of the works implemented to prevent future damage from floods, river-scouring or erosion. Other infrastructure provides for the repair or reconstruction of infrastructure pertaining to the sectors of agriculture (repair of flood protection dikes and irrigation systems), power (repair of small rural hydropower plants and transmission lines); and municipal services (repair of water supply systems)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Power","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":8},"sector5":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Flood protection"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"TJ","sectorcode":"WD,WC,LD,AI,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,78,85,52","mjthemecode":"6,11,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":68},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":8},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":8},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":8},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20080724002134","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080724002134","DocDate":"28-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02070904054443","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02070904054443","DocDate":"13-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0007130532132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0007130532132","DocDate":"28-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201010698","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201010698","DocDate":"31-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201010698","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201010698","DocURL":"31-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201010197","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201010197","DocURL":"31-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201010197","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201010197","DocDate":"31-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3980928162527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980928162527","DocDate":"03-AUG-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tajikistan"}},"facets":{}}
