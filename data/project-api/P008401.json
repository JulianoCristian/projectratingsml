The project will consist of three components: 1) a commercial bank development component, including long-term funding and technical assistance; 2) assistance to the North Estonian Bank (NEB) and 3) technical assistance to assist in project implementation. The project will: improve efficient allocation of resources by improving the intermediation capabilities of the banking sector; increase the stability of the banking sector, which will lead to greater mobilization of funds; increase long-term investment by providing critically needed long-term funds to the enterprise sector which will in turn improve the productivity of private enterprises by providing technology and capital goods; and provide an incentive for privatization by targeting investment funding toward private companies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Estonia!$!EE","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EE","sectorcode":"YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44","mjthemecode":"4,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200154252","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200154252","DocURL":"15-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200154252","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200154252","DocDate":"15-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d2a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d2a_1_0","DocDate":"18-OCT-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006163657","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006163657","DocDate":"15-SEP-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Estonia"}},"facets":{}}
