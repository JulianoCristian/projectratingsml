The project will do this by drilling oil and water injection wells; installing water injection stations and other surface utilities; providing facilities for oil treating and transportation, and gas gathering, treating and handling; and providing laboratories, consultants (466 man-months) and staff training to improve the efficiency of oilfield practices. An important feature of the project is the series of studies and surveys aimed at improving operations and planning of future investments in the petroleum subsector. The main quantifiable benefit of the project is the increased production of oil and gas, but the project also aims to achieve a significant transfer of modern technology to China."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u5927\u5e86\u77f3\u6cb9\u9ad8\u53f0\u5b50\u6cb9\u5c42\u53d1\u5c55\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5e2e\u52a9\u589e\u52a0\u5927\u5e86\u6cb9\u7530\u4ea7\u91cf\uff0c\u5411\u4e2d\u56fd\u77f3\u6cb9\u884c\u4e1a\u63a8\u4ecb\u8bbe\u5907\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u6539\u9020\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6cb9\u7530\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5f00\u94bb\u6cb9\u4e95\u548c\u6ce8\u6c34\u4e95\uff0c\u5efa\u8bbe\u6ce8\u6c34\u7ad9\u548c\u5176\u5b83\u5730\u9762\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u77f3\u6cb9\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8fd0\u8f93\u3001\u6cb9\u6c14\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5904\u7f6e\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5efa\u8bbe\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u54a8\u8be2\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08466\u4e2a\u4eba\u6708\uff09\u548c\u4eba\u5458\u57f9\u8bad\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cb9\u7530\u5b9e\u8df5\u6548\u7387\u3002\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4e00\u5927\u7279\u70b9\u662f\u5f00\u5c55\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u6539\u8fdb\u77f3\u6cb9\u884c\u4e1a\u4eca\u540e\u6295\u8d44\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6548\u76ca\u662f\u77f3\u6cb9\u548c\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u4ea7\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u9879\u76ee\u4e5f\u5c06\u5411\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u91cf\u8f6c\u8ba9\u73b0\u4ee3\u6280\u672f\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"162,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"GI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","code":"GI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925141715","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925141715","DocDate":"12-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902411224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902411224","DocDate":"31-JAN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e9782f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9782f_1_0","DocDate":"25-JAN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9782d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9782d_1_0","DocDate":"25-JAN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912585750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912585750","DocDate":"31-DEC-1982"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
