In particular the Project would implement a settlement program with the dual purpose of opening up presently blocked stockroutes and of increasing crop production. The Project would also aim at building up a development oriented local administration by helping to establish a Development Corporation. Specifically, the Project would provide staff for the Development Corporation; and would include a settlement and crop production program, including extension services, adaptive research and a pilot crop marketing scheme, range management and livestock development programs, including veterinary services, livestock-related adaptive research, and non-formal education of livestock producers; improved maintenance and further development of water facilities; project monitoring and evaluation; technical assistance in marketing to the Gum Arabic and Oil Seeds Corporations; and a human health survey."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Sudan!$!SD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"17,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"SD","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901012230","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901012230","DocDate":"30-DEC-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b49_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b49_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902280557","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902280557","DocDate":"31-MAY-1977"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Sudan"}},"facets":{}}
