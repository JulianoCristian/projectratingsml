The credit attempts to address systemic governance issues in order to raise the quality and cost-effectiveness of service delivery, and improve equity of access to secondary education. The reform agenda focuses on: 1) Accountability and systemic improvement. Reforms in these areas include rigorous enforcement of the criteria governing the establishment of institutions, and implementation of institutional mechanisms to link school subventions to objective measures of school performance; 2) Equity, through which demand-side interventions to encourage rural girls to attend secondary school are continuing; 3) Administration/capacity Building, in which MoE's planning and policy-making capacity is being strengthened with adequate institutional mechanism for oversight of a number of implementation measures, and greater implementation responsibility is being devolved to lower levels; 4) Monitoring, Evaluation and Dissemination, whereby MoE is placing significantly greater emphasis on program evaluation and monitoring to guide policy and planning; 5) Teachers ' Quality, through which an autonomous Non-Government Teacher Registration and Certification Authority has been established, and which now develops a roster of pre-qualified and certified individuals eligible to be hired as teachers by the School Management Committees (SMCs) and Governing Bodies (GBs); and 6) Textbook Production and Curriculum Development to open up textbook production to competition."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":59},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":16},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"JB,ET,BC,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Human development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,27,65,54","mjthemecode":"6,8,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":59},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Education","Percent":8},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080805011351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080805011351","DocDate":"27-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2010060410370006","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010060410370006","DocDate":"23-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000020953_20070530092637","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070530092637","DocDate":"22-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000020953_20070605131030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070605131030","DocDate":"17-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000310607_20070504103945","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070504103945","DocDate":"17-APR-2007"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
