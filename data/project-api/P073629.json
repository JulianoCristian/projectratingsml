Its objective is to assist the Government of Cameroon in setting up and implementing a decentralized financing mechanism to ensure participatory community development in rural areas. The project has the following four components: Component 1) The Community Development Program Support Project (PAPNDP) would channel grants to rural community-based organizations (CBOs with legal status) and rural communes to cofinance their proposed subprojects to reduce poverty by addressing their priority needs. Communes will have ownership of all infrastructure, whether the subproject has been requested by a community or not. When a communal subproject has been approved, the Provincial Project Unit (PPU) would transfer a grant to an account opened by the commune. For a community-based organization subproject, the commune would sign an agreement with the Community-Based Organization (CBO) to delegate implementation and management responsibilities. The community-based organization and the commune would open a joint account to receive the grant. Component 2) aims to strengthen local governance to give accountable decentralized authorities the legal authority and human and financial resources needed for local development. It includes three subcomponents. 2.1 Support to the finalization of the legal and regulatory framework for local Governance; 2.2 Capacity building for communes; 2.3 Sensitization on decentralization Component 3) aims to strengthen and empower communities to get involved in decision-making and have an active role in local development. It includes two subcomponents: 3.1. Support for preparation of local and communal development plans, subprojects, and implementation; 3.2 Specific training and outreach campaigns to improve communities' livelihoods and reduce poverty.
