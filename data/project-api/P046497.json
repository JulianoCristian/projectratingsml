There are four main project components. Component 1 develops (at the Federal level) and implements (at the Regional level) modern health services and ensures the health system's long term financial sustainability by shifting as much as possible from in-patient to out-patient care and from specialist to primary health care using modern guidelines. These changes will result in improved access to health services. Component 2 helps to develop: (i) analytical tools including national and regional financing models and equalization formula, and applies the model to the costing of benefit package and regional restructuring plans; (ii) training programs in economic and financial analysis; (iii) best practice methods and manuals for financial management and business planning; (iv) institutional capacity to carry out technology assessment; and (v) new approaches to contracting and paying health workers. Component 3 supports the design of a consistent body of laws and other regulations to ensure adequate governance of the health sector on the federal level and compliance with federal regulations at the regional level. It also supports a process of advocacy to secure the endorsement of the Government of the Russian Federation, the MOH, and respective regional authorities.
