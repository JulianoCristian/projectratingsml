The project will be executed by three institutions: ELECTROLIMA, ELECTROPERU, AND HIDRANDINA. ELECTROLIMA will be responsible for the largest component of the project comprising the 1982-1986 expansion plan for its distribution system, construction of the Yuracmayo dam, three engineering studies and a training program. ELECTROPERU will carry out engineering related to the preparation of the Mantaro transfer project, will receive technical assistance in financial management and will carry out a training program. The HIDRANDINA component will consist of engineering related to preparation of the high-priority Mayush hydroelectric project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"81,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007080019","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007080019","DocDate":"29-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e973f2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e973f2_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e973f1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e973f1_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e973ef_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e973ef_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e973ee_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e973ee_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902400710","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902400710","DocDate":"31-MAY-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
