The project design focuses on the institutional and policy changes necessary to implement the reforms, within the context of Ukraine's European Union (EU) integration efforts, and, is a valuable tool in the process of implementing the Ukraine-EU Action Plan. The DPL program, supported by the project, seeks to integrate government, and donor activities under three broad themes to improve public governance: a) investment climate, b) public administration and public finance management, and, c) social inclusion. It builds on a number of accomplishments supported under the Second Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL-2), being concluded in parallel with this loan. However, there are political and economic risks, which the DPL's design will seek to mitigate. Engagement will improve the Bank's capacity to help the authorities make appropriate policy decisions. Furthermore, the content of the program creates the basis for sustained, and diversified growth over the medium term. More broadly-based and socially inclusive growth should help dampen the political costs of reform, while reducing social and regional imbalances."},"country_namecode":"Ukraine!$!UA","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":9},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"251,260,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"UA","sectorcode":"JB,LZ,FD,YZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,27,28,54,49","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"5,6,2,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","code":"FD"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":43},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":29},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":10},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":9},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080730015748","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080730015748","DocDate":"18-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"006249897_2005102814491897","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006249897_2005102814491897","DocDate":"09-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"006249897_2005102814491897","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006249897_2005102814491897","DocURL":"09-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050614103812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050614103812","DocDate":"31-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050630102853","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050630102853","DocDate":"27-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050711100407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050711100407","DocDate":"02-MAY-2005"}],"countryname":"Ukraine","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
