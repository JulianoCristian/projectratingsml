While PRSG-10 will translate primarily into funding for the PRSP-11 implementation, additional resources under the pilot crisis response window are set aside to help the Burkinabe authorities address the impact of the global economic crisis in the cotton sector, improve the country's capacity to export cut meats and sustain support to small and medium enterprises. The development objectives of PRSG-10 are to: (i) improve the investment climate and promote exports with three intermediate results: (a) the recovery and competitiveness of the cotton sector; (b) export diversification; and (c) private investment promotion; (ii) protect access to decentralized quality services with two intermediate results: (a) the enabling of municipal competencies on school investment decisions; and (b) the improved transparency in the execution of municipal budgets; and (iii) promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources with three intermediate results: (a) the deconcentration of public procurement functions; (b) the strengthening of financial control to oversight the effective delivery of goods, works and services; and (c) the development of the sanction capacity of the court of account."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Financing Agreement,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BF","sectorcode":"EP,YW,AZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"53,43,26,27,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,2,4,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010073017362796","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010073017362796","DocDate":"08-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100416111145","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100416111145","DocDate":"09-APR-2010"}],"countryname":"Burkina Faso","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
