Implementation progress of the additional financing of Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (RMRP) is rated as satisfactory, with a disbursement rate of 86 percent (end October 2011). All works contracts of RMRP are now completed, apart from two significant roads rehabilitation contracts which were due to be completed in November 2011, but have faced delays and are currently under continuing execution. Delays with the remaining contracts were primarily due to adverse working conditions (mainly extremely adverse weather, which has hindered access to construction materials and delayed overall progress) and under resourcing of plant, labor and equipment by the key contractor of the projects. The performance of the implementing agency has been satisfactory and project implementation is satisfactory despite often challenging circumstances. The construction of a Liquefied Natural Gas pipeline and processing facility has taxed the domestic contracting capacity and caused fierce competition for contractors. The inflationary price environment in PNG has also affected contracting capacity. This project restructuring would extend project closing date from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012 with the Regional Vice President's approval. The reallocation of amounts among categories consists primarily of the formal allocation from the 'unallocated' category of the original project to rehabilitation of national roads and bridges component. Other minor changes reflect the evolved priorities and respective financing needs among various project components."},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New
