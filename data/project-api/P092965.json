The closing date for grants is proposed to be extended by one year from March 31, 2012 until March 31, 2013 in order to allow for the implementation of the two e-Government applications (Public Key Infrastructure and Certification Authority, or PKI & CA and Portal System) to be completed within the proposed extended closing date in line with the actions agreed with the Government of Mongolia. This extension will have no effect on the achievement of the original project results other than the time delay. This will be the first extension of the project. The extension meets the criteria of OP 13.30, i.e., (a) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the performance of the borrower and project implementing agencies is satisfactory; and (c) the borrower has agreed a specific action plan with the World Bank to complete the project."},"country_namecode":"Mongolia!$!MN","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":61},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"General
