It covers selected counties in eleven provinces in eastern Turkey, where mean family incomes are over 30 percent lower than the national average. About 50 percent of the beneficiaries will be small farmers, whose present incomes are at or below the poverty level established for Turkey. Supervised credit will be provided through TCZB, to about 5,200 subborrowers for investment in imported and local high-quality animals, farm buildings, pasture improvement and feedstuff production, and, in appropriate cases, tractors and other farm machinery. The project also provides for an expansion of technical/extension services to farmers and training of professional staff and farmers, both in Turkey and abroad. To enable credits to be extended to small farmers, TCZB has liberalized its loan security requirements and has agreed to bear the full risk of non-payment for sub-loans make to such small farmers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"24,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925022627","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925022627","DocDate":"16-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e30e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e30e_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e30c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e30c_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902310199","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902310199","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912383040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912383040","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
