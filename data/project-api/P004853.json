The WSTEC component will provide assistance for the replanting and rehabilitation of its coconut and cocoa plantings and pasture areas, improvement and expansion of coffee, coconut stems and soap processing facilities and the provision of technical assistance.  This component is expected to increase productivity, resulting in enhanced domestic consumption and exports of cocoa, copra, soap products, coconut stem products and beef. The research and extension component would provide assistance to the DOA for improvements to research and extension as follows:  establishment of a National Agricultural Extension Center, provision of 21 new field extension centers, transport and support facilities, technical assistance for agricultural research and extension, and fellowships for overseas training.
