The Bank will support the government's strategy in its critical efforts to improve Jordan's balance of payments. The project has two components. The first will support a substantial increase in Jordan's potash export capacity from the current 1.4 million tons annually to 1.8 million tons. This will be achieved through optimization of Arab Potash Company's (APC) existing plant. Implementation of this component is an important step in APC's further financial recovery, enabling the Company, once it has established a track record of consistent profits, to attract private capital for its future investment programs. The project will finance, under international competitive bidding procedures, centrifuges and other process equipment and an expansion of water supply. The second component will help the Government and APC through limited use of consultant advisory services to formulate an investment strategy for developing new chemical industries based on Dead Sea brine."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"Mining and other extractive","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Mining and other extractive"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"JO","sectorcode":"LB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,45","mjthemecode":"5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Mining and other extractive","code":"LB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019123048","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019123048","DocDate":"16-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042011575491","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042011575491","DocDate":"17-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040711453592","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040711453592","DocDate":"17-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960930215119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930215119","DocDate":"05-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930214802","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930214802","DocDate":"05-JUN-1991"}],"countryname":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan"}},"facets":{}}
