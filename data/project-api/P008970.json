These cities were selected for the project because they exemplify the problems of rapid urban growth and service deficiencies, and because future growth there will be jeopardized if services are not provided more efficiently.  It intends to assist the five municipalities in directing urban growth and catching up on service deficiencies through financing infrastructure investments.  At the same time, it seeks to strengthen their ability to plan, implement, operate, and maintain these services, while improving their resource mobilization and financial management.  The project will finance part of the 1987-94 segment of the five municipalities' investment programs.  The main components to be supported under the project include:  (a) area-based infrastructure programs; (b) citywide infrastructure development programs; and (c) an institutional development program.  The project will help refine and implement the Government's decentralization policy.  It will demonstrate a strategy which should enable Turkey to handle its urban growth problems in a more cost-effective manner."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"UM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban management","code":"UM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019181325","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019181325","DocDate":"31-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926060910","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926060910","DocDate":"04-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
