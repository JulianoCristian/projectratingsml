It provides for an immediate increase in water production to meet water demands up to 1985 and for expansion of the water distribution network into the poorer sections of Al Mukalla. The project also provides for the formulation and implementation of a health education program designed to encourage the population in Al Mukalla to improve health practices and sanitary conditions. It further includes: hydrogeological studies needed for the design of the water production facilities; an urban growth study to forecast the pace of urbanization in the Al Mukalla area and to plan for the expansion of basic urban services in this area. A total of 122 man-months of consulting services is provided. The project would provide substantial health and environmental benefits to the population of Al Mukalla."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"3,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925073643","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925073643","DocDate":"30-NOV-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e042e0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e042e0_1_0","DocDate":"02-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e042de_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e042de_1_0","DocDate":"02-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902374814","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902374814","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912533697","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912533697","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
