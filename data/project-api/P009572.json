Specifically, it seeks to (a) increase the number and quality of primary schools; (b) increase the number and effectiveness of primary teachers; and (c) strengthen administrative and educational support services of the Department of Energy (DOE).  To that end, the project consists of three specific components:  (a) primary school development, (b) teacher training institutions and (c) educational administration.  In addition to financing the construction of school and teacher training facilities, the project intends to finance 8.4 staff-years of technical assistance and 17.8 staff-years of fellowships and placements, as well as some vehicles and equipment."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Bhutan!$!BT","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":56},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"4,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BT","sectorcode":"BH,BC,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"65,30,78","mjthemecode":"10,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":56},{"Name":"Education","Percent":21},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980901092643","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980901092643","DocDate":"26-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123232543","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123232543","DocURL":"09-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123233046","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123233046","DocURL":"09-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123232845","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123232845","DocURL":"09-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123232442","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123232442","DocURL":"09-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123232744","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123232744","DocURL":"09-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07ef8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07ef8_1_0","DocDate":"19-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926132318","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926132318","DocDate":"29-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926132422","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926132422","DocDate":"28-FEB-1988"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Bhutan"}},"facets":{}}
