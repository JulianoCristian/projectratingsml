It will cover the entire National Irrigation System (NIS) service area of 600,000 ha, benefitting some 430,000 rural families. During the project annual average expenditure on O&M will be increased to about US$ 24.80/ha, a level of about 90% of what is estimated to be necessary to maintain the National Irrigation System (NIS)s at maximum productivity. The project will also provide for minor rehabilitation of existing infrastructure; assist in the further development of IAs (Irrigators Association) and expanded beneficiary participation in O&M of all National Irrigation System (NIS)s. The project will also substantially increase O&M cost recovery through improved irrigation service fee billing and collection efficiency."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007205213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007205213","DocDate":"29-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032314511758","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032314511758","DocDate":"13-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926173402","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926173402","DocDate":"27-APR-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
