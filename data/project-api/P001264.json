The project includes: (a) improvement of outgrower and nucleus estate sugar production; (b) factory rehabilitation and expansion; (c) provision of modest staff housing plus utilities; (d) road upgrading and construction; (e) drainage; (f) irrigation; and (g) research. The project would result in a 109,000 tons per annum increase in sugar production and related decrease in imports by the mid-1980s saving about US$30.0 million net foreign exchange annually; income increases of between 25%-190% for some 10,800 smallholder families would result, and incomes to the sugar estates and several hundred large cane producers would also increase. In addition, some 1,000 wage paying opportunities would be created. The project faces some risks in that the incremental cane output could be less than anticipated if the planned organizational improvements in company-outgrower relationships fail to materialize or if yield shortfalls occur due to varying soils and weather conditions. Furthermore, investment in additional sugar production capacity beyond that currently planned could result in a surplus above domestic consumption, which might have to be exported."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"72,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3c5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3c5_1_0","DocDate":"05-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902315387","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902315387","DocDate":"30-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.2","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000094946_00081905411721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081905411721","DocDate":"17-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912380188","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912380188","DocDate":"17-NOV-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
