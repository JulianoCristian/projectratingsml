Project components call for: 1) investments in infrastructure, and equipment supply to rehabilitate the West line of the Metrofor subway system, and complement the South line. This component will also rehabilitate, or build as necessary, transfer stations to serve between the subway, buses, autos, and non-motorized modes of transport. Project management, and supervision will be financed to assist the Project Coordination Unit, and with detailed engineering designs, respectively; and, 2) institutional, and policy formulation to support the decentralization from the Federal Government to the State, and the subsequent concession of Metrofor to the private sector. Technical assistance will be provided to strengthen the Regional Transport Coordination Commission, and, to prepare an integrated transport policy, land use, and air quality management strategy, to meet quality targets, through sound cost-recovery tariffs, and subsidy policies."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of
