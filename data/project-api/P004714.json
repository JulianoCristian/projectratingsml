About one million people would receive improved water service and one half million people would receive service for the first time. The project will also provide advisory services to PWWA in the fields of water system operation and maintenance and in financial management, and will finance studies and designs for the preparation of additional water supply projects in provincial areas. While PWWA, as a fledging institution, has never undertaken a project of this magnitude, risks have been minimized by organizing project management to take full advantage of experienced regional staff and by providing related assistance."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925045039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925045039","DocDate":"30-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e961d9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961d9_1_0","DocDate":"03-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e961d8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961d8_1_0","DocDate":"03-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190234222","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190234222","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191248491","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191248491","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
