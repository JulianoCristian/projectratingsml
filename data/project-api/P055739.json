The components call for: 1) Energy efficiency improvements in institutional buildings, to include healthcare, educational, and cultural buildings. The component will build heat meters, automate substations, and include weather-stripping, and radiator reflectors. Additionally, ceiling fans, faucet flow restrictors, and hot water heat exchangers, will be installed, along with riser balancing valves. 2) Technical audits, to yield engineering estimates of the buildings' present energy consumption, and provide feasible retrofit actions for energy efficiency. Technical designs for retrofit measures will be required, as well as technical specifications for competitive bidding. Substantial training will be provided. 3) Consulting services for project management, to include monitoring and evaluation, and, to develop training modules for energy efficiency measures. An awareness campaign will be developed, and training programs included. Consultants will review regulations for social assistance support, and strengthen communications, through computerization provision. 4) Financial audits, to cover incremental audit costs."},"country_namecode":"Ukraine!$!UA","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"18,290,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"UA","sectorcode":"LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development"],"themecode":"72,81,71","mjthemecode":"9,11,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20051220094932","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20051220094932","DocDate":"06-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201450352","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201450352","DocURL":"25-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201450453","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201450453","DocURL":"25-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00010805312342","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00010805312342","DocDate":"28-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903310678","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903310678","DocDate":"14-APR-1998"}],"countryname":"Ukraine"}},"facets":{}}
