Under this restructuring, there will be extension of closing date to August 31, 2014. The project extension will allow the preparation of a reallocation of proceeds to reflect the large demand for the voucher program which will be processed in July 1014. It will also provide some additional time for the vouchers under the last agricultural campaign (coffee in the Southeast), which has just concluded, to be paid out by the partner bank to the service providers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Haiti!$!HT","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":66},"sector2":{"Name":"Public administration- Agriculture, fishing and
