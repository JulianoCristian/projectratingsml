Specifically, it would provide:  credit to artisanal and commercial fishermen for fish production; credit for fish marketing facilities; foreign exchange assistance for the manufacture of fishing nets; and technical assistance.  The implementation of the project would increase fish production by about 10 percent and raise incomes of about 3,500 fishing families from an average of K 1,400 to about K 2,800 per family. Technical assistance would strengthen ZADB and the Department of Fisheries (DOF)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"7,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"AF","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","code":"AF"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716150615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716150615","DocDate":"30-NOV-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05cc3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05cc3_1_0","DocDate":"27-NOV-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05cbf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05cbf_1_0","DocDate":"27-NOV-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia"}},"facets":{}}
