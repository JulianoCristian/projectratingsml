The ERRC III assists GOSL in moving from the transitional phase of peace building to the medium term phase of Sierra Leone's strategy of poverty reduction, founded on good governance and economic growth. It will provide critical resources to finance activities associated with: (I) consolidating progress made in governance, including improved management of public resources and decentralization of government, empowering local agencies to manage the delivery of basic services throughout the country; and (ii) stimulating economic growth by establishing an enabling environment for private sector- led investment. This includes maintaining macroeconomic stability, revising the investment code to make it more transparent and competitive to attract investors, further liberalizing the trade regime, pursuing its divestiture strategy and implementing reforms in the mining sector. The credit will allow the import of essential commodities, including food products, petroleum products, and the raw materials and intermediate goods required for economic reconstruction and rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure country-wide. Adequate funding will also facilitate the preparation of a fully participatory PRSP by December 2003."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Sierra Leone!$!SL","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Mining and other extractive","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":16},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Mining and other extractive"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other industry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Project Information Document,Program Document","countrycode":"SL","sectorcode":"YW,BH,LB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,26,27,47,40","mjthemecode":"4,5,2,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Mining and other extractive","code":"LB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050915090142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050915090142","DocDate":"12-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000160016_20041217155209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20041217155209","DocDate":"14-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0304300404495","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0304300404495","DocDate":"25-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20030501155754","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030501155754","DocDate":"23-APR-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Sierra Leone"}},"facets":{}}
