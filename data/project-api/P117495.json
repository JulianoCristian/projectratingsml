It adopts policies and reforms that support more efficient governance and contribute to broad based growth by easing the key constraints posed by low agriculture productivity, low skills base, and the high cost of infrastructure services in Rwanda. The operation complements the sector budget support, Community Living Standards Credit (CLSC), to support continued reforms in health and the implementation of the Vision Umurenge Program (VUP). Supported policies draw on the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) for monitoring the EDPRS, to reduce the transaction costs of Government reporting to donors on the use of aid funds. This program continues to support the Government of Rwanda as it implements measures to foster broad based growth in the context of enhanced decentralization reforms. Donor support to the Rwanda budget, based on policy reforms and outcome indicators of the CPAF, are the reflection of a mature partnership between international partners and Rwanda. Rwanda's performance is impressive when looking at the number of EDPRS indicator targets which have been met already, as well as the number of policy actions which have been implemented since 2008. In 2010 Rwanda continued its strong reform performance, despite the impact of the recent global economic slowdown."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":10},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":10},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":45},"totalcommamt":"104,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"FZ,EZ,AZ,LZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Human development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"27,66,39,79","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,4,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":21},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":13},{"Name":"Education","Percent":13},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20130301100508","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130301100508","DocDate":"28-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b0812c8d78_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0812c8d78_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000171540_2011031811294316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2011031811294316","DocDate":"11-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000356161_20110203000659","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110203000659","DocDate":"25-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20101215160038","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20101215160038","DocDate":"15-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000003596_20101109093216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000003596_20101109093216","DocDate":"04-NOV-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
