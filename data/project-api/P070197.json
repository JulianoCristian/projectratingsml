The additional financing (AF) will help to finance costs associated with the gap resulting from a failure to secure parallel financing for the Tan Hoa - Lo Gom canal improvement sub-project and to cover a financing gap that is the result of high levels of inflation during 2007-08 in the construction sector in Vietnam. There is one major change that will be supported by the additional financing: the Tan Hoa - Lo Gom canal improvement sub-project will be included as an International Development Association (IDA) funded activity rather than as a parallel financed activity. Although this sub-project was always part of the original scope of the project works in Ho Chi Minh City, it was originally intended to be financed through a parallel financing from the French Development Bank (AFD). However, as the funding did not materialize, it was agreed to include this sub-project in the IDA additional financing. The original project scope included the canal improvement in the design, and the appraisal of the parent project. The inclusion of this sub-component for IDA additional financing will not change the original expected project outcomes."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of
