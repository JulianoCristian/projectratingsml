The project will finance the following two components: 1) an investment fund to finance rehabilitation, equipment, management and maintenance subprojects; and 2) institutional development, which will support: an adequate framework for pricing and reimbursing health care providers; a list of priority health benefits to be financed by the SUS; a differentiated reimbursement schedule favoring more cost-effective interventions; the introduction of cost recovery for care provided to privately-insured patients under the SUS; and better management of the quality of services and fraud control."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,67","mjthemecode":"8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20041006093723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041006093723","DocDate":"30-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123114958","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123114958","DocURL":"27-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123115259","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123115259","DocURL":"27-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214132449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214132449","DocDate":"21-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
