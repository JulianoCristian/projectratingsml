In the Hetao area of Nei Monggol, the project intends to rehabilitate and complete existing drains and canals serving 210,000 ha of presently low-yielding cropland and marginal grazing area.  In the Yinnan area of Ningxia, it aims to upgrade and complete irrigation and drainage works on 22,000 ha and open up 14,200 ha of newly irrigated land.  By ensuring a more reliable water supply, providing agricultural inputs such as fertilizer and plastic mulch, and strengthening extension services, the project will expand production of wheat, corn, oilseed, sugar beet, fruits, fodder crops and livestock.  A resettlement component in Ningxia will relocate 11,000 poor farm families on newly irrigated land and provide infrastructure and support services.  The project will also provide local and overseas training for technical and managerial staff, farmers and extension workers."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
