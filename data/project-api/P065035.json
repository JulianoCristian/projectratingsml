The project would empower farmer and herder households in project areas to better manage their grassland resources and improve the forage and feed production on arable lands. More efficient and quality focused livestock production would increase the farmers and herders incomes and generate marketable surplus to improve living standards. Developing efficient livestock marketing systems in the project counties would also increase the efficiency of the whole livestock production system and contribute raising the living standards of farmers and herders. The global environmental objective of the project is to maintain and nurture natural grassland ecosystems to enhance global environmental benefits. More specifically, the project aims to mitigate land degradation, conserve globally important biodiversity, and enhance carbon sequestration, through promotion of integrated ecosystem management in the grassland, desert, and forest ecosystems of the Qilian Shan, Tian Shan, and Altaishan mountain ranges in Western China. The global environmental objective would be achieved by implementing community based grassland management in selected project areas with high global biodiversity values; providing incremental investments for implementing grassland management plans; and carrying out monitoring of these grasslands' habitats.  The project has five components: (1) Grassland Management and Forage Improvement; (2) Livestock Production Improvement; (3) Market Systems Development; (4) Applied Research, Training, and Extension; and (5) Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation.
