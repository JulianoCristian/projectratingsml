There are two project components. The first component, Institutional Development, comprises three sub-components: 1) promoting academic excellence; 2) networking institutions for quality enhancement and resource sharing; and 3) enhancing quality and reach of services to the community and the economy. Under this component, qualifying institutions, based on their capabilities, will be first selected either as lead institutions or as network institutions, and then be required to compete through specific sub-projects. The second component, System Management Capacity Improvement, supports 1) developing a modern management style through training of policy planners, managers, and administrators from the central and participating state governments. 2) conducting studies at the State and national levels, the findings of which would be used for improving policy and decisionmaking processes, and implementing reforms; 3) enhancing performance and the quality and efficiency of State audits of institutions; and 4) establishing structures and facilities for program management at the central and State levels."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Indigenous Peoples Plan","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BH,BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"62,66","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20120127033202","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120127033202","DocDate":"19-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20091020235645","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091020235645","DocDate":"24-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_01113004010429","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01113004010429","DocDate":"01-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201325228","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201325228","DocURL":"04-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201325429","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201325429","DocURL":"04-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02103004200329","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02103004200329","DocDate":"23-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0111210401211","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0111210401211","DocDate":"26-AUG-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000094946_02071004093971","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071004093971","DocDate":"30-JUN-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of India","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
