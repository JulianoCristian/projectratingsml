The project will also stimulate and facilitate private sector participation in the energy sector and enhance Ministry of Mines and Energy's (MME's) ability to promote petroleum exploration and development. The project has a significant \"pilot\" dimension and may be viewed as the starting point for a comprehensive, long-term development of the country's fossil-fuel resources. In order for the project to operate in an enabling regulatory environment, the Transitional Government of Ethiopia will implement and maintain a revised LPG pricing policy based on import parity, study ways to optimize current pricing policy for all petroleum products, and establish national LPG standards."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":7},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":23},"theme4":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"74,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"BC,TA,LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"53,43,84,54,44","mjthemecode":"4,6,11,4,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":90},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01072804145894","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072804145894","DocDate":"28-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121201831","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121201831","DocURL":"23-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121202032","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121202032","DocDate":"23-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121201831","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121201831","DocDate":"23-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121202032","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121202032","DocURL":"23-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b5e7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b5e7_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b5e5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b5e5_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004043404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004043404","DocDate":"18-FEB-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110320","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110320","DocDate":"31-MAR-1993"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
