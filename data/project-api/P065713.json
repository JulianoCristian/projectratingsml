The components call for: 1) data collection, and analysis to form the basis for planning, and responding to changes in disease trends, and epidemics. Component activities include surveillance techniques to improve HAMSET; establishment of an epidemic forecasting, and preparedness system; capacity building to improve operational research in the identification of HAMSET changes; methodology to link research, and monitoring/evaluation results, to policy formulation; and, disease management training at the Ministry of Health; 2) multi-sectoral control of HAMSET transmission, through increased information, capacity building, and education practices on healthy behaviors, access to preventive and diagnostic services, and environmental techniques for malaria vector control; 3) strengthening diagnostic, health care, and counseling services, by establishing blood banks, and improving prevention management, laboratory diagnosis, and availability of drugs; 4) identification of mechanisms to minimize transmission, through community counseling, and management responsiveness; and, 5) project management, emphasizing on monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"State of Eritrea!$!ER","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":83},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government
