PARPA I1 is mainly focused on shared growth and on the need for decentralization. Within this context, PRSC 3 is expected to help the GoM in: (a) the consolidation and deepening of the institutional reforms in the area of macroeconomic management; (b) reforms in governance by supporting decentralization to enhance public investments and service delivery at the provincial and district level, and by supporting public sector reform; and (c) economic development by improving the investment climate, removing constraints to growth, such as infrastructure, and promoting agricultural growth. The operation will help the Government maintain macroeconomic stability while it continues to pursue a reform agenda that cannot be fully financed from domestic sources. The reforms would enable Mozambique to make further progress in reducing absolute poverty, improving the delivery o f services and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. One set of risks is concerned with the potential for macroeconomic instability. A second set of risks concerns weak administrative capacity to implement reforms. A third set of risks concerns a deterioration in governance that could compromise economic reforms and poverty reduction efforts. A final set of risks concerns the potential impact of HIV/AIDS in reducing human and institutional capacity to deliver public services and may pose a contingent liability regarding the future costs of treating this disease."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>PRSC 3</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le troisi\u00e8me Cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC 3) propos\u00e9 est le premier d\u2019une nouvelle s\u00e9rie de PRSC mis en place pour aider le Gouvernement du Mozambique \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre des mesures cl\u00e9s pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans son second Plan de r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 absolue (plus connu sous son acronyme portugais PARPA I1) et dans le Cadre d\u2019\u00e9valuation des performances approuv\u00e9 par le Gouvernement et les 18 partenaires ext\u00e9rieurs qui apportent une aide budg\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale au Gouvernement du Mozambique. Le PARPA I1 est principalement ax\u00e9 sur la croissance partag\u00e9e et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9centralisation. Dans ce contexte, le PRSC 3 devrait aider le Gouvernement \u00e0 : (a) consolider et approfondir les r\u00e9formes institutionnelles dans le domaine de la gestion macro\u00e9conomique ; (b) r\u00e9former la gouvernance via l\u2019appui \u00e0 la d\u00e9centralisation en vue d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les investissements publics et la prestation de services au niveau des provinces et districts et, en soutenant la r\u00e9forme du secteur public ; et (c) assurer le d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique en am\u00e9liorant le climat des investissements, en levant les obstacles \u00e0 la croissance (comme l'infrastructure) et en favorisant la croissance agricole. Le cr\u00e9dit aidera le Gouvernement \u00e0 entretenir la stabilit\u00e9 macro\u00e9conomique tout en poursuivant un programme de r\u00e9formes que les sources de financement int\u00e9rieures ne peuvent suffire \u00e0 financer totalement. Les r\u00e9formes permettront au Mozambique de faire de nouveaux progr\u00e8s dans la r\u00e9duction du d\u00e9nuement absolu, l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de la prestation de services et la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs du Mill\u00e9naire pour le d\u00e9veloppement. La possible instabilit\u00e9 macro\u00e9conomique pose un certain nombre de risques. De plus, une deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie de risques r\u00e9sulte d\u2019une faible capacit\u00e9 administrative de mise en \u0153uvre des r\u00e9formes. Une troisi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie de risques porte sur une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de la gouvernance susceptible de compromettre les r\u00e9formes \u00e9conomiques et les efforts de r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9.
