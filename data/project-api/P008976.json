The project will expand the number of training places in various institutions such as the Apprenticeship Training Centers and the Public Training Centers and will improve the quality of Non-Formal Vocational Training (NFVT) programs and enhance their relevance to labor market needs through technical assistance and training in a number of critical areas.  These areas include instructor training, training needs assessment, curriculum design, instructional materials development, skill testing and certification, and entrepreneurship courses.  The project further includes the establishment of production revolving funds to enable the training institutions to generate additional revenues through the production of items for sale.  The project will make a valuable contribution towards meeting critical manpower shortages which constrain economic growth in manufacturing industries and will also significantly increase basic skill training to improve employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":93},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"58,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"BC,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"themecode":"65,51,59","mjthemecode":"7,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":93},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102453","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102453","DocDate":"30-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702134524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702134524","DocDate":"30-NOV-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926030033","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926030033","DocDate":"12-NOV-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
