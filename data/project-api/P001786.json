There are four main project components. The first improves the quality of education by expanding pre-service teacher training programs; revitalizing the network of teacher support zones; transforming the curriculum for grades 1-7 to reflect integration of the educational cycles and materials, and to promote values and sensitization to national culture and regional diversity; supplying textbooks and teaching materials; improving classroom assessments and examinations; providing grants for quality improvement; and training school directors. The second component increases access to education and improves equity by expanding the number of places and supporting girls' education initiatives as well as improving non-formal education and special education. The third component strengthens the institutional capacity of the education ministry in organizational structure, policy and planning, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation. The fourth component funds development of a strategy for operating the technical and vocational systems and for enhancing quality and efficiency in higher education."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":18},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":1},"sector5":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"71,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"}],"docty":"Agreement,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"EL,EV,BZ,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"59,78,57,65,61","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,8,7,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":70},{"Name":"Education","Percent":18},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":1},{"Name":"Education","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2010102715141513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010102715141513","DocDate":"29-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20061227110255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20061227110255","DocDate":"01-DEC-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121321453","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121321453","DocURL":"04-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121321453","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121321453","DocDate":"04-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910550490","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910550490","DocDate":"22-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703525536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703525536","DocDate":"22-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052116143993","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052116143993","DocDate":"12-DEC-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
