The project will assist the Government in implementing this strategy by: 1) supporting the infrastructural, pedagogic, and managerial improvements needed to introduce the revised integrated primary education cycle nationally; 2) improving the quality and relevance of the technical, vocational and professional training system to provide skills relevant to the labor market; and 3) strengthening the institutioanl capacity to develop policies and implement programs for education, training and employment. The project comprises three major components. First, the establishment of a national Integrated Basic Education System (EBI) inclusive of upgraded school infrastructure, primary teacher training and the establishment of a sustainable textbook supply and distribution system. Second, the improvement of the relevance of technical education and training through a rise in entry requirements to secondary education, changes in curricula and teacher training and an improvement in effectiveness of technical training by establishing apprenticeship programs overseas. Third, developing the institutional capacity to develop programs and implement policies by reinforcing ministry planning and managerial capacity and monitoring training and employment activities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cabo Verde!$!CV","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":7},"sector4":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":4},"sector5":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"11,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CV","sectorcode":"ET,EV,ES,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"51,61,65,66","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":68},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17},{"Name":"Education","Percent":7},{"Name":"Education","Percent":4},{"Name":"Education","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01010405302422","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01010405302422","DocDate":"08-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042808323123","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042808323123","DocDate":"08-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042808292222","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042808292222","DocDate":"07-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030316123824","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030316123824","DocDate":"24-FEB-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b462_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b462_1_0","DocDate":"19-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007125452","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007125452","DocDate":"19-DEC-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cabo Verde","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
