This will be accomplished by supporting poor families' investments in their 0-17 year old children's health, nutrition, and education in the face of sharply reduced incomes. The project consists of six components: 1) The Educational Grant Component will finance scholarships for children aged 7-17 years old belonging to families with SISBEN (Beneficiary Selection System for Social Programs) 1 classification. 2) The Health/Nutrition Grant Component will finance direct cash grants to eligible families with 0-6 year old children, who are not in the community nutrition and pre-school program of the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF). 3) The Project Management Component will finance the operational activities of the temporary National Coordinating Unit. 4) The Monitoring and Evaluation Component will finance the external review and evaluation of the performance and impact of the project. 5) The Promotion and Dissemination Component will support public relation and information campaign activities via mass media. 6) The Health, Education, and Nutrition Services Delivery Component consists of education, health, and nutrition services provided by involved public institutions to eligible project beneficiaries in the participating municipalities receiving Bank-financed grants."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"BC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Human development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"87,65,54,63","mjthemecode":"8,6,8,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":86},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20061002102909","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061002102909","DocDate":"30-SEP-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201544462","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201544462","DocURL":"23-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052110440137","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052110440137","DocDate":"23-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01032006473396","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032006473396","DocDate":"01-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01021405532699","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01021405532699","DocDate":"06-FEB-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
