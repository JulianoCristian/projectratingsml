The closing date for the project will be extended from August 31, 2012 until December 31, 2012.  This will be the first extension of the Project. The Project is on track towards completion and implementation performance has been satisfactory. Key performance indicators have been met - 3,200 primary school teachers and 69 methodologists have been trained in pedagogical practice; schools in four oblasts were provided furniture; and a standard package of teaching materials was distributed to 2,135 schools enabling them to open at least one preschool class to the communities they serve.  At the same time, due to successful procurement processes, the Project has accumulated a savings of USD 250,000 which will be used for the purchase of additional learning materials should this extension is approved."},"country_namecode":"Kyrgyz Republic!$!KG","sector1":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Public administration- Education","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Public administration- Education"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"KG","sectorcode":"BN,EC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0001346798","geoLocName":"Osh Oblasty","latitude":"40","longitude":"73","country":"KG"},{"geoLocId":"0001527297","geoLocName":"Talas Oblasty","latitude":"42.333328","longitude":"72","country":"KG"},{"geoLocId":"0001528260","geoLocName":"Issyk-Kulskaya Oblast","latitude":"42","longitude":"78","country":"KG"},{"geoLocId":"0001529778","geoLocName":"Jalal-Abad Oblasty","latitude":"41.5","longitude":"72.5","country":"KG"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"65","mjthemecode":"8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Public administration- Education","code":"BN"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b08183ab50_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08183ab50_1_0","DocDate":"24-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012061813403155","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012061813403155","DocDate":"18-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20120626001427","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120626001427","DocDate":"11-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20120626001014","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120626001014","DocDate":"11-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012012915594923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012012915594923","DocDate":"29-JAN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000362596_2011040414245943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000362596_2011040414245943","DocDate":"21-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20101206151239","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20101206151239","DocDate":"01-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000003596_20101111142528","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000003596_20101111142528","DocDate":"08-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000101930_20100104132807","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000101930_20100104132807","DocDate":"04-JAN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000262044_20091215152946","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20091215152946","DocDate":"04-DEC-2009"}],"countryname":"Kyrgyz Republic"}},"facets":{}}
