The credit will finance a range of small-scale subprojects in four broad categories:  (a) social infrastructure; (b) economic infrastructure; (c) social services; and (d) credit to small informal sector entrepreneurs. Wherever feasible, the subprojects will be carried out by small private contractors using labor-intensive methods.  The credit will also provide institutional support through technical assistance to the Honduran Social Investment Fund.  Finally, the credit will provide technical assistance to the Nongovernmental Organization Liaison Office, to strengthen the partnership between the public sector and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in addressing poverty problems, and to promote NGOs' role in the preparation of subprojects in poorer communities, so that the poor can actually take advantage of all funds targeted on them."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"10,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,41,56","mjthemecode":"6,4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214165916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214165916","DocDate":"24-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121573387","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121573387","DocURL":"29-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121573387","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121573387","DocDate":"29-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e395a4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e395a4_1_0","DocDate":"25-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002215847","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002215847","DocDate":"18-MAY-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras"}},"facets":{}}
