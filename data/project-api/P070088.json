The project also supports the enforcement of several international conventions relating to the environment. There are four main project components. The first improves customs procedures by aligning them with European Union standards and developing a monitoring mechanism; provides training on new procedures; and designates border and inland customs stations to serve as test sites for ideas to improve operations. The second component supports trade facilitation by strengthening the private-public partnership and improves the performance of trade facilitation agents. The third component improves the customs information system by using electronic messaging system, making electronic payment of duties, using digital signature--including the selection of the most appropriate translator and digital signature software, implementing computer valuation and tariff classification systems, and upgrading to a web-based system. It also increases the number of computers and printers, purchases Internet service servers, provides technology software, and upgrades infrastructure for servers. The fourth component improves border crossing facilities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Croatia!$!HR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"13,930,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"HR","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"47,39,29","mjthemecode":"2,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20051221182005","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051221182005","DocDate":"08-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040511044129","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040511044129","DocDate":"27-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00102005303880","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00102005303880","DocDate":"27-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00062305373232","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00062305373232","DocDate":"27-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00031505333330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00031505333330","DocDate":"07-FEB-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Croatia"}},"facets":{}}
