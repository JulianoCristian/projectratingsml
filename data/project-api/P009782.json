Potential risks include the early deterioration of project roads as a result of flooding and inadequate maintenance, and a delay in the realization of agricultural benefits. These risks would be minimized by the implementation of improved construction and maintenance standards and by ensuring that road construction and improvement works are carried out only where complementary investments take place."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Rural roads","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Rural roads"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"TR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Rural roads","code":"TR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925052038","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925052038","DocDate":"23-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04254_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04254_1_0","DocDate":"11-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0424c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0424c_1_0","DocDate":"11-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902361912","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902361912","DocDate":"31-OCT-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912501254","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912501254","DocDate":"31-OCT-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
