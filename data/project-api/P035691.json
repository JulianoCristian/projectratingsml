The most immediate objective of the project is to safeguard the only feasible road connection between the port of Mombasa and the main areas of economic activity in Kenya. The condition of the road already causes major operating problems and, if the road continues to deteriorate, severe constraints to Kenya's export-oriented growth strategy will develop. The project will significantly reduce present and future vehicle operating costs, journey times and improve traffic safety. The project will also encourage private sector involvement in the maintenance of infrastructure, strengthen monitoring/control of road maintenance activities and provide basic institutional support for road maintenance planning. The project is designed to reconstruct and strengthen Mombasa road in order to provide economic operating conditions along Kenya's main road link to the sea for a design life of 15 years. The project comprises four main components: 1) reconstruction/strengthening of the Nairobi-Mombasa road, which can be split into six separate sections, each requiring a different level of intervention to safeguard operating conditions; 2) pilot routine maintenance contracts, which will be monitored by an independent research institution within a \"structured learning\" framework; 3) road works inspectorate, which will be located within the Design Branch and will thus be independent of both the paved and unpaved maintenance branches; and 4) institutional support, which will be provided through a twinning arrangement with an external road agency."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":93},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,45","mjthemecode":"5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":93},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050210092537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050210092537","DocDate":"08-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123383874","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123383874","DocURL":"13-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123383673","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123383673","DocDate":"13-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123383673","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123383673","DocURL":"13-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123383874","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123383874","DocDate":"13-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23c2c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23c2c_1_0","DocDate":"30-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019100447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019100447","DocDate":"08-NOV-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
