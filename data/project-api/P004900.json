To this end, the project supports:  (i) the newly established Technical Quality Control Organization (CTTP) in planning and supervising pavement strengthening programs and in road maintenance planning and management; and (ii) the creation of a transport investigation study and planning center under the Ministry of Transport's (MOT) direction, to improve sector policy formulation.  The proposed loan aims to finance:  (i) a road rehabilitation and maintenance component; (ii) technical assistance; and (iii) preparation of a comprehensive, multi-modal transport study.  Finally, the project provides funds for (iv) preparation of priority engineering studies and analyses for railways and ports; and (v) procurement of related training materials and equipment.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected from reduced road-user costs and prolonged life of road pavements."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019162640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019162640","DocDate":"05-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926044123","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926044123","DocDate":"17-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926044035","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926044035","DocDate":"17-APR-1987"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
