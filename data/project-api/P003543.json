The project consists of the construction of a new 948km, single track line, running from Jining in central Inner Mongolia to Tongliao in the eastern part of the region. The line will connect at both ends with the national network. It will have an initial capacity of 7 million tons per year (per direction) and will be expanded as traffic builds up. Major components of the project are: (i) the construction of the railway line; (ii) the acquisition and installation of operational equipment; and (iii) the recruitment and training of staff to operate the railway. Related components include land acquisition and resettlement, and the development of the second-most important coal deposit in China, so far largely untouched."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic
