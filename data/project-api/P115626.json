The bedrock of crisis management must continue to be a macroeconomic framework that supports fiscal and external balance, including appropriate exchange rate management, while preserving debt sustainability over the medium term. In improving competitiveness, the DPO program will assist the Government to alleviate private sector and governance constraints. Thus, the DPO series proposes to focus on high impact reforms aimed at public sector modernization and private sector development. Priority reforms need to span both the public and private sectors and focus on the following to unlock growth potential, alleviate the human capital constraint, and reduce corruption: strengthening the business environment through lower business registration and inspection costs; improving corporate governance; modernizing the regulatory framework in telecommunications, mining, and energy; reducing compliance costs through tax and customs reform; and improving efficiency and accountability in public financial management through system reform and strengthening incentives in the civil service."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Armenia!$!AM","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries"},{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"AM","sectorcode":"LZ,LS,EZ,JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"28,54,40,38,82","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,4,4,6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","code":"LS"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":15},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20130819123722","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130819123722","DocDate":"05-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2009112413500047","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009112413500047","DocURL":"07-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2009112413500047","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009112413500047","DocDate":"07-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000350881_20090708095848","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20090708095848","DocDate":"02-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090720101313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090720101313","DocDate":"31-MAY-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Armenia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
