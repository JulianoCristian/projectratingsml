The components of the Second Reform of the Secondary Education Project will: 1) finance grants to selected secondary schools, on the basis of annual work programs, and budgets for activities designed to improve student outcomes, as well as direct costs associated with preparing, and implementing school improvement plans. Technical assistance (TA) will support the preparation of a school improvement plan manual, and training materials, while training assistance in school development, and management will be provided; 2) finance centrally coordinated activities that complement the bottom up approach, and support all-age schools not eligible for school improvement grants (SIGs), to rally national literacy programs, and mathematics, by providing tools for teachers to diagnose the specific learning problems, enriching libraries and media centers, and supporting counseling for at-risk youths; 3) provide access to upper secondary school, by securing excess capacity in independent secondary schools, through construction of new schools, and extension of existing selected schools; and, 4) support the Ministry of Education, and regional offices implement the above components, as their role shifts from centralized, to one responsive to school-based demands for TA, and continuous support on monitoring outcomes."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Segundo proyecto de reforma de la educaci\u00f3n secundaria - Jamaica</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"39,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Board Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Resettlement Plan,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"JM","sectorcode":"ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Urban development","Human development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,65,71,30","mjthemecode":"2,9,8,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20100503025713","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100503025713","DocDate":"25-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000090341_20061012134827","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061012134827","DocDate":"11-OCT-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000160016_20060310123329","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060310123329","DocDate":"09-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201583621","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201583621","DocURL":"31-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201583520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201583520","DocDate":"31-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201583319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201583319","DocDate":"31-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_02090704180334","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02090704180334","DocDate":"30-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02092104004622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02092104004622","DocDate":"16-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03062404132756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03062404132756","DocDate":"31-AUG-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01110204024444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01110204024444","DocDate":"25-OCT-2001"}],"countryname":"Jamaica"}},"facets":{}}
