The FMCDPL series, along with parallel Development Policy Loans (DPLs) in the areas of social policy and environment, were designed in close partnership with Government of Peru (GoP) and in line with its policy program- as outlined in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The development objective of the loan is to contribute to growth and poverty alleviation by supporting two main policy areas: (i) efficiency and quality of fiscal management and (ii) competitiveness. Peru entered the global crisis in a solid position and has managed its challenges well. Good macroeconomic fundamentals and appropriate policy responses to the crisis moderated the negative impact of weaker external demand and external shocks. Aware of the downside risks to economic growth as well to poverty and employment, the GoP implemented counter-cyclical policies to mitigate the impact of the crisis. Nonetheless, the GoP has not lost sight of the medium-term objectives of its reform agenda, and has continued to make progress in improving the effectiveness of fiscal management and supporting the country's competitiveness and integration into the global economy."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":16},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade"},{"Name":"Capital markets"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"FK,YY,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"27,28,49,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,5,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other domestic and international trade","code":"YY"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":67},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":17},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20120719014828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120719014828","DocDate":"01-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022317165705","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022317165705","DocDate":"23-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081af58f8_2_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081af58f8_2_0","DocDate":"23-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000020439_20100804161617","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20100804161617","DocDate":"16-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20110324082529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110324082529","DocDate":"16-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100707143514","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100707143514","DocDate":"07-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100629114008","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100629114008","DocDate":"07-JUN-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
