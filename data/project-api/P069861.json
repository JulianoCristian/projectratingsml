The loan will encourage and enable the current Administration's momentum on several key social reforms that have been developed with active Bank support; b) provide an opportunity to influence the social sector agenda of the next Administration; and c) help sustain the government's fiscal program during this calendar year. The loan supports the medium term strategic framework including: the introduction of a system of periodic impact/performance evaluation and public monitoring of the government's main social sector programs to improve their transparency and citizen's oversight; the development of a comprehensive Social Risk Management System, improvements in ICBF (Colombian Institute for Family Welfare) child assistance programs, and formulation of a time-bound action plan to eliminate barriers to internally displaced population's access to social program; the expansion of the subsidized health insurance coverage of the poor; and improvement of the public education regulatory framework, establishment of performance and monitoring agreements between the national and selected local governments, and more effective dissemination of information regarding educational methodologies to improve the education of the poor."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector4":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":23},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"155,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"BZ,JB,EZ,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Human development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,67,56,65,27","mjthemecode":"2,8,6,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Education","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201580397","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201580397","DocURL":"06-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201580397","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201580397","DocDate":"06-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000094946_02071304010449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071304010449","DocDate":"18-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030709121208","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030709121208","DocDate":"02-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02022804022278","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022804022278","DocDate":"28-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03061104031097","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03061104031097","DocDate":"21-FEB-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
