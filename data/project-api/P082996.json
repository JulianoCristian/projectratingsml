Under the PFPSAL program, the World Bank (WB) intends to disburse a total of US$2.55 billion in adjustment lending to meet Turkey's external and budgetary financing requirements to support the Government's short and medium-term reform goals in the financial and public sectors, and to help protect critical social spending. The PFPSAL III follows on the first PFPSAL of US$1.1 billion approved in July 2001 (US$700 million on standard IBRD terms and US$400 million on Special Structural Adjustment Loan-SSAL-terms) and disbursed in a single tranche in July 200 1. The three-tranche Second Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL II) of US$1.35 billion (US$550 million on standard IBRD terms and US$800 million on SSAL terms) was approved in April 2002. The first US$450 million tranche of PFPSAL II was disbursed upon effectiveness in August 2002. However, disbursement of the remaining tranches of PFPSAL II was delayed by a slowdown in implementation of the economic reform program during the run-up to early legislative elections held in November 2002 and establishment of the new Government. Further delays resulted from external developments in the region, notably in Iraq. The undisbursed amounts under PFPSAL II were cancelled in June 2003 at the authorities' request."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":45},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"1,000,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Program Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"BG,FA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Economic management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"28,25,23,43,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,4,1,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":45},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080718002628","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080718002628","DocDate":"17-MAR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000090341_20060612093220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060612093220","DocDate":"09-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20040824100444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040824100444","DocDate":"21-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03052804025213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052804025213","DocDate":"22-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03052804025110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052804025110","DocDate":"17-APR-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
