The project will also assist in strengthening the local contracting industry, particularly in its efforts to recover from the prolonged slump in construction activity during the 1970s. The Bank loan will finance about 7 percent of the cost of the program, which in turn, will correspond to 15.6 percent of the estimated foreign exchange cost. The items that will be financed include: (a) rehabilitation, paving and new construction contracts; (b) maintenance equipment; (c) studies; and (d) technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"152,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925102243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925102243","DocDate":"19-FEB-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97395_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97395_1_0","DocDate":"01-APR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e97394_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97394_1_0","DocDate":"01-APR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190239216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190239216","DocDate":"31-MAR-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
