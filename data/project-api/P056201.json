The operation is designed as an exceptional two tranche PRSC in order to further harmonize with the other donors providing budget-support. This is the second operation within the framework of three operations that were designed as part o f the First PRSC approved in July 2004 (Report no. 29262-MZ). This two-tranche credit completes the support envisaged within the framework of the first PRSC. The PRSC 2 will continue to support the Government's reform agenda of promoting growth, accelerating human resource development, and strengthening governance and public sector management. The second tranche of the proposed PRSC 2 would focus on two pillars: (1) crosscutting actions to strengthen public sector performance by enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public resources, and (2) enhancing the investment climate."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"JA,EZ,FZ,YZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,34","mjthemecode":"3,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":30},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20090709014858","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090709014858","DocDate":"17-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070124111541","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070124111541","DocDate":"17-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000310607_20070131102614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070131102614","DocDate":"05-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010030111173190","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111173190","DocURL":"16-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010030111173190","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111173190","DocDate":"16-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20050818090736","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050818090736","DocDate":"04-AUG-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique"}},"facets":{}}
