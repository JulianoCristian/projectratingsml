The Project would also improve water use efficiency at the farm level in existing major irrigation systems. The Project consists of: (a) over the next five years, construction of about 15 medium-scale irrigation projects (MIPs) (MIPs are irrigation projects that encompass cultivable command areas covering between 2,000 and 12,000 ha); (b) command area development (CAD), over a four year period, in three existing major irrigation projects located in Orissa (Mahanadi Delta, Hirakud, Salandi), consisting of land consolidation covering about 200,000 ha; and on-farm works, including construction of field channels, drains, and structures covering a consolidated area of about 57,000 ha."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"58,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625093047","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625093047","DocDate":"17-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081df5674_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081df5674_1_0","DocDate":"06-SEP-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b69_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b69_1_0","DocDate":"06-SEP-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b68_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b68_1_0","DocDate":"06-SEP-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902290069","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902290069","DocDate":"31-AUG-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912032374","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912032374","DocDate":"31-AUG-1977"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
