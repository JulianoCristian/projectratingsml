The project consists of three basic elements. The first is the Population Activities Fund (PAF), which will provide grants to qualified collaborating agencies (CAs) for subprojects they have prepared. Many of the subprojects will focus on increasing family planning (FP) practice through provision of services and intensive information/education/communication (IEC). Other subprojects will develop leadership commitment to NPP or help prepare CAs to provide support functions for NPP in planning, coordination, training, monitoring, evaluation, or research. Second, the project will help develop a small PAF Agency (PAFA) that will manage PAF in cooperation with the Department of Population Activities (DPA). Jointly PAFA and DPA will develop the capacity to assist CAs with preparation of additional subprojects and to appraise and supervise them. The third element of the project is designed to stimulate intensive analysis of socio-cultural constraints to fertility reduction, review relevant experiences from other countries, and design innovative interventions for adoption by implementing CAs."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"78,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,67,27","mjthemecode":"2,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121020411","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121020411","DocURL":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121020411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121020411","DocDate":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e371b5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e371b5_1_0","DocDate":"07-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929052914","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929052914","DocDate":"02-APR-1991"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
