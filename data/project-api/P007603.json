The project will also provide financing to facilitate the test marketing of a new lower price house although project beneficiaries will generally be above the poverty line, (above two minimum wages), beneficiaries closer to the poverty line will be reached. If the test marketing is successful it is estimated that about 300,000 Type A houses would be constructed during the period, with about 19% of the program's financing provided under the loan. The project also includes studies related to savings mobilization and investment in rental properties."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"UH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban housing","code":"UH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006165209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006165209","DocDate":"13-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042112335357","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042112335357","DocDate":"28-SEP-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041911481555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041911481555","DocDate":"28-SEP-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031811120056","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031811120056","DocDate":"28-SEP-1988"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
