The Social Housing Program for Sale (SHPS) aims at accelerating the completion of about 51,000 social units for sale, mostly under Entreprises de Promotion et de Logement Familial's (EPLF) management, through: supply of strategic construction materials (cement, wood and steel rods), finishing products, and small equipment and spare parts.  The private housing program, targeted primarily to self-help builders, aims at assisting the private sector in completing its unfinished housing stock.  It will supply the private sector with strategic construction materials.  The technical assistance component aims at assisting the Government in implementing key housing policy objectives in the following three critical areas: improving the housing supply incentives; reforming housing finance; and reforming and targeting housing subsidies.  In addition, the technical assistance program will provide specific support to the Ministry of Housing to mitigate the negative environmental impact of the housing construction sector."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Housing finance","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Housing construction"},{"Name":"Housing finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"FC,YC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,86,56","mjthemecode":"6,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"},{"name":"Housing finance","code":"FC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":98},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99051205331638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99051205331638","DocDate":"31-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122570173","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122570173","DocURL":"17-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122565972","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122565972","DocDate":"17-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122565771","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122565771","DocURL":"17-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122565972","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122565972","DocURL":"17-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122570173","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122570173","DocDate":"17-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122565771","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122565771","DocDate":"17-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003231922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003231922","DocDate":"11-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003231620","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003231620","DocDate":"11-FEB-1993"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
