The project consists of three components.  First is improvement of the supervisory control and transmission network systems for NEK.  The second is completion of units 3 and 4 of the pumped storage project at Chaira, which is owned by NEK.  Third is technical assistance, primarily to help NEK in operating more efficiently and in a more commercial manner."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"93,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BG","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,39,84,85","mjthemecode":"11,11,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02031010371440","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02031010371440","DocDate":"21-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200102349","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200102349","DocURL":"21-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200102450","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200102450","DocURL":"21-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003140238","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003140238","DocDate":"03-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003135902","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003135902","DocDate":"03-FEB-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Bulgaria"}},"facets":{}}
