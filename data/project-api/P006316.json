It consists of: (i) institutional strengthening of EBTU; (ii) integrated transport investment programs in ten cities and conurbations; and (iii) a 500-km low-cost paving program in several other cities. The first subproject will help reorganize EBTU, apply the newly developed Project Manual and train EBTU and local staff. Six studies of critical urban transport problems will also be included in the project, and assistance will be provided to the cities through local project management units. The second subproject will improve transport infrastructure and operation in ten medium-sized cities and conurbations. Congestion will be reduced and traffic safety improved by low-cost measures including the provision of better signals, bus only streets and bus lanes, terminals and shelters. Roads will be constructed where necessary to serve developing areas or to insert missing links in road networks. In the first three cities already selected for the program, between 58% and 96% of the components will benefit the urban poor. The project's third component will provide 500 km of low-cost pavement."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban transport","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban transport"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"TU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban transport","code":"TU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925062014","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925062014","DocDate":"26-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97626_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97626_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e97625_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97625_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902370926","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902370926","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912515328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912515328","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
