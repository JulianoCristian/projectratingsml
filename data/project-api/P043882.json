Agricultural productivity, and sustainability will be increased, providing needed technology, information, and training for private farmers, and agro-processors. The two main components: 1) applied research, and extension, will support agricultural research, and extension on priority problems, by means of a Competitive Grant Scheme (CGS). It will ensure a close association between research scientist/extension specialists, and the needs of newly emerged private farmers, particularly in the formulation, and evaluation of research, and extension proposals. CGS will extend the range of research and extension grant participants, to include universities, NGOs, private industry, and extension services. Funding will be provided to meet priority needs, marketing, and efficient input, and low cost options, for production, and processing. Proposals' evaluation criteria will include farm utility, experience, and transfer of technology, as well as environmental impacts; 2) institution building, will administer the CGS, and implement a rapid impact program to deliver extension messages, and conduct applied research. Technical assistance, and training will be delivered for capacity building, and future restructuring services."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":81},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":19},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"11,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"77,78,39,75","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,4,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":81},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333038_20080731004235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080731004235","DocDate":"18-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20060721135832","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060721135832","DocDate":"22-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200423962","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200423962","DocURL":"27-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200423560","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200423560","DocURL":"27-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200423962","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200423962","DocDate":"27-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200423761","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200423761","DocDate":"27-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200423560","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200423560","DocDate":"27-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00010805302140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00010805302140","DocDate":"15-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903283743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903283743","DocDate":"18-DEC-1998"}],"countryname":"Romania","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
