In excess of 100,000 tons (730,000 barrels) of oil are estimated to be trapped in very difficult to access bogs and creek beds, three times the amount released during the Exxon Valdez spill. In autumn 1994 over 20,000 tons (140,000 barrels) of oil were released into the Kolva River when temporary dikes built to contain the oil, failed during heavy fall rains. Serious damages were caused to downstream communities, in particular, Kolva village, as a result of the releases. The Komi Republic emergency Situation Commission on October 10, 1994 declared an emergency in the Kolva River area. Wholesale release of the remaining oil into the river would create an ecological disaster, threatening the livelihood of the downstream communities which depend on the river system and the overall environment of the Pectora river system into which the Kolva and Usa rivers flow. Immediate priority is completion of structures to contain the oil to allow orderly removal and disposal of gross oil. Construction of significant new structures is also required in the very limited time remaining before spring thaw. In addition to the significant containment and cleanup efforts required, further serious spills are likely from the pipeline if urgent rehabilitation investment are not undertaken. Continuation of oil production and transport is also important to provide fuel for the heating plant serving the Usinsk region. The project is justified on the basis of the severity of the present and potential environmental disaster, as well as the need to continue oil production in a sustainable way in the Komi region. In addition, this emergency operation wil"},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"99,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"JB,LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social protection and risk management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,54,84","mjthemecode":"11,6,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":98},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03012304085926","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03012304085926","DocDate":"30-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3c00_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3c00_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3bfe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3bfe_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081ea3bfd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3bfd_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200190086","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200190086","DocDate":"25-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200185885","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200185885","DocDate":"25-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200190086","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200190086","DocURL":"25-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200185885","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200185885","DocURL":"25-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200185784","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200185784","DocURL":"25-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200185784","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200185784","DocDate":"25-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961008001135","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008001135","DocDate":"05-APR-1995"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
