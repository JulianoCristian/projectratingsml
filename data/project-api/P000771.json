ESRDF will provide financial and technical support to communities and community groups to construct or rehabilitate, and maintain basic economic and social infrastructure and services that they have prioritized and in which they are willing to invest. In addition, ESRDF will support community actions aimed at environmental conservation and rehabilitation. ESRDF's efforts will be focused on poor communities, and especially, poor women. To achieve these goals, ESRDF will strengthen community capacity in project identification, implementation, and maintenance. The project will also support the establishment of a Welfare Monitoring System to strengthen capacity to collect and analyze information related to causes, patterns, and incidence of poverty; and improve the basis for developing poverty reduction strategies, assessing the impact on the poor of economic policy reform, and evaluating the benefits of other poverty reductions interventions. The components of this project will be as follows: 1) construction and rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure and improvement of related services including basic health and education, small-scale irrigation, urban sanitation and rural water supply; 2) welfare monitoring system; and 3) capacity building, training and research."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":11},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"AI,WZ,EZ,JA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"59,57,53,56,78","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,6,6,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":35},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050805101501","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050805101501","DocDate":"24-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121275709","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121275709","DocURL":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121275910","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121275910","DocURL":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121275709","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121275709","DocDate":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121275910","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121275910","DocDate":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019144537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019144537","DocDate":"13-MAR-1996"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
