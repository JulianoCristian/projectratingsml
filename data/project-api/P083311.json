The first phase will support financial sector institutional development, through reforms in the following five areas: a) strategy for the management of systemic risks, b) legal and regulatory framework, c) anti-money laundering, and prevention of terrorism financing, d) strengthening of supervision, and control of systemic risks, and, e) payments system. A second phase that would partially fund a systemic consolidation strategy, would be triggered by key indicative actions such as: a) private consensus on a consolidation strategy, b) demonstrated practical relevance of the institutional development supported by the first phase; and, c) a diagnosis of the solvency position of the largest banks. The project will support sorely needed institutional development in key areas affecting the financial sector, and will also strengthen the dialogue between the Bank and Honduras, placing the Bank in a better position to assist in the financial sector's consolidation process. While there is little risk that actions required under the first project might not be taken, there is however, the need for substantial additional reform, built on solid analytical work and consensus among stakeholders, required to support the following second operation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Honduras: Primer Cr\u00e9dito Program\u00e1tico en Apoyo de las Pol\u00edticas de Desarrollo del Sector Financiero</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":37},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","Percent":23},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"BG,FG,FZ,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Economic management","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"42,40,23,38,44","mjthemecode":"4,4,1,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","code":"FG"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":37},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":30},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":23},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2009033116442725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009033116442725","DocDate":"13-OCT-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2009033116442725","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009033116442725","DocURL":"13-OCT-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20080804030448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080804030448","DocDate":"24-JUL-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2005100711380729","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2005100711380729","DocURL":"18-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2005100711380729","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2005100711380729","DocDate":"18-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050218134141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050218134141","DocDate":"24-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20050318102433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050318102433","DocDate":"14-JAN-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras"}},"facets":{}}
