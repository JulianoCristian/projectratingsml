It would consist of a 40-meter high rockfill dam and a hydraulic system leading to a powerhouse with two 10 MW turbine generators. Consulting services for studies of the utility's tariff structure, resettlement of some 300 people in the reservoir area, bid evaluation and construction supervision, and its implications for human health and fish resources would be included in the Project.
