Nationwide in scope, the project would: (a) strengthen basic health services; (b) support the in-service training needs of health personnel; (c) improve the supply and utilization of basic drugs; (d) develop health education services; and (e) strengthen the capability of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) to plan, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of primary health care activities. The project would yield benefits by providing better health care services in general, and maternal and child health in particular, to a large segment of the rural population. Family planning services, would be extended to health centers in rural areas. The project would also support Government's attempt to promote cost recovery in the health sector by offering the rural population better services in return for their financial participation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"HB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Basic health","code":"HB"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925142541","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925142541","DocDate":"17-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05843_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05843_1_0","DocDate":"16-DEC-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902405599","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902405599","DocDate":"30-NOV-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191259243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191259243","DocDate":"30-NOV-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
