The project comprises two components, one of which is development of management capabilities and policy adjustments. The project will finance technical assistance, training and office technology to develop and implement: (a) financial management and performance evaluation procedures; (b) a management information system; (c) the reorganization of the administration and patient registration units; and (d) sectoral strategies and reform program management. The second component consists of improvement of service quality.
