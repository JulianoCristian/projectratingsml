The additional credit will support the completion of original project activities in view of unanticipated cost overruns arising from higher unit costs. These increased costs reflect the fact that the demand-driven selection of beneficiary communities during the first two years of implementation has resulted in a larger share of towns with small population sizes, compared to appraisal estimates, thereby leading to higher per capita investment costs for the smaller piped water schemes. The proposed additional financing would thus enable the Borrower to achieve the original key outcome indicator of serving 500,000 people with safe and sustainable water supply services. Except for the revision to the project costs and financing plan, no changes to the project development objective, outcome indicators, general design, and implementation modalities are sought. Financial management and procurement arrangements, institutional roles and responsibilities and the closing date remain unchanged."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
