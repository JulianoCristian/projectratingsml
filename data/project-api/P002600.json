To this end, the project consists of (a) provision and installation of two oil-fueled steam thermal generating units of between 45 MW and 60 MW each, at the existing Khartoum North power plant; (b) technical assistance, training and equipment and materials for NEC's organizational and staff development; and (c) provision of consulting services for an Environmental Study.  Lastly, the project also provides (d) technical assistance for the National Energy Administration (NEA) for energy planning, studies and for institutional development.  Implementation of the proposed project would relieve a heavy constraint on production increases in agriculture and manufacturing in the early 90's."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Sudan!$!SD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"38,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"SD","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007200543","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007200543","DocDate":"06-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120285655","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120285655","DocURL":"09-NOV-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120285856","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120285856","DocDate":"09-NOV-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120285655","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120285655","DocDate":"09-NOV-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120285856","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120285856","DocURL":"09-NOV-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e368a3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e368a3_1_0","DocDate":"05-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e368a1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e368a1_1_0","DocDate":"05-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091901","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091901","DocDate":"30-APR-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Sudan"}},"facets":{}}
