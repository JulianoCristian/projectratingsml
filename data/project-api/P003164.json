In addition to increasing the firm energy of the Kafue power station, the dam would provide sufficient water storage to permit additional water discharges in dry years to reproduce the annual flood cycle downstream of the dam on which present agricultural development depends. The storage could be increased to allow for possible future irrigated agriculture on the Kafue Flats. Regulation of the river flow provided by the Project would also be useful for subsequent development under a third stage of the Kafue Project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"115,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6aa5a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6aa5a_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUL-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e6aa59_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6aa59_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUL-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902201383","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902201383","DocDate":"30-JUN-1973"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia"}},"facets":{}}
