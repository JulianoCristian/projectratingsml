The project is designed around two main lines of action: 1) implementation of administrative and policy reforms and 2) financial support for a package of development activities. The project will finance the following six major components: 1) rationalizing rangeland management by setting up and administering 21 Agro-Pastoral Action Areas ; 2) strengthening the animal health services and setting up veterinary checkpoints at the country's borders; 3) implementing a grassroots capacity development program among herders and their wives to help them organize themselves into herding interest groups or mixed farming interest groups ; 4) setting up and running a mutual savings and loan scheme and a line of financial assistance for herd rebuilding; 5) technical support to livestock activities; and 6) ensuring the proper administration of the above activities by providing training of supervisory staff and directing project administration costs."},"country_namecode":"Central African Republic!$!CF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"16,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"CF","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,77,25,57","mjthemecode":"7,2,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00062405383063","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00062405383063","DocDate":"29-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121234515","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121234515","DocDate":"13-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121234314","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121234314","DocDate":"13-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121234515","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121234515","DocURL":"13-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121234314","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121234314","DocURL":"13-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b43e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b43e_1_0","DocDate":"01-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b43c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b43c_1_0","DocDate":"01-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006111145","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006111145","DocDate":"01-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006111437","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006111437","DocDate":"01-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135424","DocDate":"01-JAN-1993"}],"countryname":"Central African Republic"}},"facets":{}}
