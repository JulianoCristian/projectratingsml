In order to ensure sound management of the refinery, the Government has established Bangchak Petroleum Company, Ltd. (BCP), a fully autonomous and commercial company, to operate and manage the refinery. The Government appointed a strong board of directors and a managing director who is BCP's chief operating officer. In addition, a management and operations team from Caltex Petroleum Corporation (US) was appointed for in-line positions directly under the managing director. The Bangchak Oil Refinery Restructuring Project covers the physical rehabilitation of the refinery, operations and infrastructure improvement, energy conservation and engineering and management assistance. A study will be undertaken to determine further modifications required to ensure that the product mix of all refineries in Thailand will be in balance with the projected demand profile for petroleum products in the country."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"85,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"IC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","code":"IC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006133255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006133255","DocDate":"11-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094638","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
