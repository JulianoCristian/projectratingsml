The original project development objective (PDO) implied that all inventoried obsolete pesticides and associated waste will be disposed of through disposal overseas. However, with the discovery of greater than budgeted associated waste, especially contaminated soils as described above, and the consequent increase in the total cost for disposal, it is preferable to adopt a blended approach of disposal overseas and lower-cost safeguarding in-country based on risk profiling of the contaminated waste, i.e. obsolete pesticides and higher risk stocks of heavily contaminated soils will be disposed of overseas while lower risk stocks of associated waste will be safeguarded (and later decontaminated subject to additional funding) in, country. This approach is expected to eliminate the stocks' risk to nearby population and the environment. In addition, the original PDO assumed zero new accumulations of obsolete pesticides during the life of the project, which has been proven difficult to achieve in the context of agricultural intensification resulting in continuous new accumulations. Therefore, it is proposed that the project focus rather on developing a strategy for management and reduction of future accumulations to be endorsed by the Steering Committee."},"country_namecode":"Africa!$!3A","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Programme africain relatif aux stocks de pesticides (PASP) \u2013 P1 Ethiopie</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le projet propos\u00e9 correspond \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me phase du Pr\u00eat de la Banque mondiale \u00e0 un programme \u00e9volutif (APL) le Programme-Projet africain N\u00ba 1 relatif aux stocks de pesticides (ASP-Pl), qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par la direction du FEM le 16 ao\u00fbt 2005 et par le Conseil de la Banque mondiale le 8 septembre 2005.
