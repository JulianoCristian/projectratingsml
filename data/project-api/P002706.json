This expansion will be carried out in two stages, the first comprising additions and improvements to the existing processing line through purchase of equipment, machinery and quality control devices and secondly, installation of a completely new processing line. A survey to determine timing, scale and location of any further investment in processing plant will be provided for in the project. The project will also include technical assistance and training and will provide for improved storage facilities at Morogoro and a new office and export storage in Dar es Salaam. Construction of roads, water supply facilities, offices, railroad sidings and other basic infrastructure at Morogoro will also be provided for."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904163651","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904163651","DocDate":"29-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904163652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904163652","DocDate":"27-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081df55b4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081df55b4_1_0","DocDate":"07-SEP-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081df55b2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081df55b2_1_0","DocDate":"07-SEP-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902265723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902265723","DocDate":"31-AUG-1976"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
