It will further seek to facilitate the design, and execution of a program to enhance cultural diversity, and pluralism as specified by the Guatemalan Peace Accords, and the National Congress on Cultural Policies. The four main components will: 1) support universal access to primary education by expanding the primary schools' enrollment capacity in rural areas, and marginal communities, through the National Community-managed Program for Educational Development (PRONADE). Under this program, rural communities will receive financing for development of new school facilities, based on a participatory criteria. Economic assistance/scholarships will be available for poor families, with an emphasis on girls attendance; 2) focus on improving the quality of education, by strengthening multi-grade strategies, and bilingual education; providing educational materials; and, training teachers in new methodologies, including educational content, and bilingual curricula development; 3) support the institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Culture and Sports (MCS), in coordination with the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC), to attain cultural diversity, and pluralism.
