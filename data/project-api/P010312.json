It will also expand the transmission system to meet projected demand at the least cost and strengthen the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The project consists of a five-year time slice of CEB's program to take over licensees' power distribution systems. In addition, it will rehabilitate and expand those systems, and develop its transmission system. It will consist of an island wide rehabilitation and extension of low voltage distribution networks, and it will provide technical assistance to CEB."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"PP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment","code":"PP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214131623","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214131623","DocDate":"18-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123240068","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123240068","DocURL":"31-AUG-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123235867","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123235867","DocURL":"31-AUG-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e082f4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e082f4_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e082f2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e082f2_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926194922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926194922","DocDate":"02-JUN-1988"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
