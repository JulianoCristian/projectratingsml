The project's global environmental objective is to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions in Indonesia. The penetration of SHS will reduce these emissions by displacing the use of fossil fuels. The project consists of two major components: (1) a credit component comprising an IBRD loan and a GEF grant, to enable purchase of solar home systems by rural households and commercial establishments on an installment plan basis; and (2) technical assistance, including support of detailed monitoring and evaluation activities during project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":23},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Renewable energy"}],"docty":"Agreement,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,GEF Project Document,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"LE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48,39,81,78,44","mjthemecode":"4,10,11,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042816275915","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042816275915","DocDate":"02-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01081004045086","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01081004045086","DocDate":"25-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042816245418","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042816245418","DocDate":"28-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042816224117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042816224117","DocDate":"28-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042816202216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042816202216","DocDate":"24-FEB-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184210","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184210","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040610092620","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040610092620","DocDate":"11-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052516443119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052516443119","DocDate":"11-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"GEF Project Document (PD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PD","EntityID":"000009265_3970619110747","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970619110747","DocDate":"31-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970311115313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970311115313","DocDate":"17-DEC-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
