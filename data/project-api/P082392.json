Following the restructuring in September 2010, implementation performance has improved albeit slowly.  Prospects for achieving the revised project development objective by closing date of June 2012 remains positive given continued Government commitment as demonstrated by the Cabinet approval of the framework document to guide the implementation of the Grenada lands agency. The reallocation is necessary to finance the key activities that will facilitate the proper functioning of the two enhanced departments (Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property Office and Lands Agency) following their amalgamation under the project which are critical to achieving the revised project development objective."},"country_namecode":"Grenada!$!GD","sector1":{"Name":"Central
