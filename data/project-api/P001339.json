Four main components correspond to the four objectives: (a) the physical rehabilitation and institutional development of KNH; (b) a strategic plan for health services in the Nairobi area and its initial implementation; (c) strengthening the Division of Planning and Development in the Ministry of Health and conducting analyses to lead to a future sector reform program and a public investment program for health; and (d) the design and implementation of a system of household surveys and the analysis of their results."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
