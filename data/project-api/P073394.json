Construction works include the rehabilitation of roads, flood control, and irrigation systems, in addition to schools rehabilitation. Moreover, the project will assist the Government in formulating a long-term strategy, aimed at reducing the country's vulnerability to flooding. Nonetheless, potential risks include the occurrence of flooding during project implementation, therefore damaging project investments, and, weak implementation capacity, and delays due to slow procurement processes. However, implementation risks will be minimized by using existing agencies, while damage from recurring floods would be minimized by assisting the Government in developing a long-term strategy to reduce vulnerability to floods."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Cambodia!$!KH","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":24},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"sector5":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Flood protection"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Technical Annex","countrycode":"KH","sectorcode":"TA,BC,WD,AI,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"52,78","mjthemecode":"10,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":24},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":12},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":11},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000020439_20071004113531","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20071004113531","DocDate":"27-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20060120135505","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060120135505","DocDate":"21-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201184531","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201184531","DocURL":"28-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01020605310251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01020605310251","DocDate":"16-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_0103030557229","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0103030557229","DocDate":"16-FEB-2001"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Cambodia"}},"facets":{}}
