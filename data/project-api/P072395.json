The reforms in fiscal management are designed to strengthen the Government's capacity to meet macroeconomic stabilization targets while the parastatal reforms will help in both reducing the burden on the budget and improve delivery of key infrastructure services crucial for growth. The reforms in agriculture will contribute to growth by increasing the returns to smallholder farmers through creating better functioning land, tobacco and maize markets. The reforms in HIV/AIDS will provide the framework for channeling resources and strengthening institutions in order to mitigate the health and social impacts of HIVIAIDS. There are four main risks to the operation. First, there is a risk of policy slippage. Malawi goes to general elections in May 2004. In the run up to the elections, there is a risk of fiscal slippages due to election related expenses. In addition, a new Government after May 2004 may be less committed to reforms than the present one. Second, there is a risk that delays in donor inflows could create the need to approach the domestic market tofinance the Budget. Third, there is risk of exogenous shocks, especially one of drought and famine, destabilizing the macroeconomic agenda. Fourth, there is risk arising from the high incidence of HIVIAIDS. The first risk has been mitigated by the wide consultations with all stakeholders, including civil society organizations (CSOs) to create broad support for the program and providing technical assistance to firm up the analytical basis for the reforms. The second risk has been mitigated by working closely with all our development partners, including the Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS) group and the African Dev"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Power","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"CT,LD,AH,YA,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Human development"],"themecode":"88,83,43,77,27","mjthemecode":"2,10,4,11,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":25},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":10},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070504111553","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070504111553","DocDate":"13-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000090341_20060331085433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060331085433","DocDate":"30-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"005325975_2007061516063975","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005325975_2007061516063975","DocURL":"03-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"005325975_2007061516063975","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005325975_2007061516063975","DocDate":"03-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20040129095924","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040129095924","DocDate":"23-JAN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000160016_20031203110746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20031203110746","DocDate":"02-NOV-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
