The object of the program is to meet, at least cost, EDP's forecast growth in demand while maintaining the required reliability of the system. The 1983-85 investment program includes: (i) construction of hydroplants which will eventually add 1460 MW to the system; (ii) completion of the second phase of an oil-fired thermal plant (2 x 250 MW), installation of two combustion turbines (2 x 83 MW) at an existing plant, and work on the first phase of a coal-fired thermal plant (2 x 300 MW); (iii) construction of about 564 km of transmission lines and about 12,500 km of medium- and low-voltage distribution lines, with associated transformer capacity of about 4,700 MVA; (iv) expansion of testing and measurement facilities; (v) computer hardware and software, and a study for upgrading the accounting system; and (vi) study for the identification of possible nuclear plant sites."},"country_namecode":"Portuguese Republic!$!PT","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"126,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PT","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97848_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97848_1_0","DocDate":"22-FEB-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e97847_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97847_1_0","DocDate":"22-FEB-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902411737","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902411737","DocDate":"31-JAN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912575024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912575024","DocDate":"31-JAN-1983"}],"countryname":"Portuguese Republic"}},"facets":{}}
