There are two project components. The first component will build the capacity of the Consortium and Citizen's Network to implement the Program for Development and Peace. It will develop the Consortium's capacity to move from a participatory planning mode to an operational mode characterized by acting as a catalyst among beneficiaries and stakeholders, promoting the establishment of effective partnerships with other organizations, and dealing effectively with the diverse interests of key stakeholders in the region. It will also strengthen the Citizen's Network so that it is capable of influencing public affairs and implementing development projects based on local initiatives. The second component will develop, test, and document approaches which bring together community processes and resources around specific development initiatives agreed upon by citizens and authorities of selected municipalities or sub-regions of Magdalena Medio."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":64},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"BG,EZ,TA,JA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,57,53,26","mjthemecode":"2,6,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":64},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01072804145790","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072804145790","DocDate":"27-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200390210","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200390210","DocURL":"10-JUL-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200390109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200390109","DocDate":"10-JUL-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200390210","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200390210","DocDate":"10-JUL-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000356161_20120927035659","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120927035659","DocDate":"19-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980728143900","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980728143900","DocDate":"19-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101224","DocDate":"28-MAY-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
