The project, designed to finance a time slice (1998 to 2002) of the FRMP, consists of: (1) civil works to increase the capacity and traffic safety of the federal network, including providing additional lanes on some road sections, building climbing lanes on others, improving horizontal and vertical alignments, providing adequate road shoulders and curbs and removing hazardous spots; (2) institutional strengthening directed at the Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) and selected state highway organizations for improving management systems and procedures, training staff and reviewing the role and needs of the SCT centers in the states; and (3) further support to SCT to implement actions on road sector financing, to improve multi-modal transport operations, and to continue improving road safety and environmental impact assessment and mitigation measures in the planning, construction, and operation of transport facilities."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":89},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"475,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,39,40","mjthemecode":"4,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":89},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172150","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172150","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170634","DocDate":"06-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171330","DocDate":"01-JAN-1995"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
