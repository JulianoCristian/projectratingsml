The project has the following two components: Component 1) Labor-intensive public work will provide grants to households whose adults participate in public works sub-projects. Sub-projects to be undertaken as part of public works will be determined locally by the beneficiary communities through an annual, participatory planning process. Direct support will provide grants to households who are labor-poor and cannot undertake public works. Component 2) This component will focus on strengthening all aspects of program implementation, including (i) capacity building at community level to strengthen beneficiary identification and local level planning, financial management, procurement and technical training at woreda and regional level to ensure that all sub-projects are appropriately designed and rapid response mechanisms are in place to ensure smooth program implementation; (ii) support to the development of a monitoring and evaluation framework and a program MIS. This includes the implementation of a beneficiary survey, and a detailed program process survey after the first 12 months. It will also finance several additional studies as part of the shift to the second phase of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL); and (iii) procurement of essential goods and services."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
