The project builds on experience gained during the implementation of the pilot project.  The main elements of the program are:  (i) efficient organization of extension services, provided with adequate human and physical resources, at the farmer, regional and national levels; (ii) regular and continuous training of responsible officials at each level by means of a system of fortnightly, monthly and annual training sessions; (iii) strengthening of the linkages between the extension services and the national and regional research services; (iv) strengthening of relations between the crop farming, livestock and environment services; (v) functional literacy and numeracy training both for men and women.  Investment will be in:  (a) civil works; (b) vehicles and equipment; (c) incremental operating costs; (d) on-farm research; (e) training; and (f) short-term technical assistance to establish and periodically supervise a project accounting and budgeting system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":16},"sector3":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":9},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"24,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"BC,AT,EL,AJ,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,78,65","mjthemecode":"8,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":60},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":16},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99061705394862","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99061705394862","DocDate":"20-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20120824021556","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120824021556","DocDate":"20-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121014200","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121014200","DocURL":"31-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121014200","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121014200","DocDate":"31-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e371a8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e371a8_1_0","DocDate":"02-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930034813","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930034813","DocDate":"05-MAR-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
