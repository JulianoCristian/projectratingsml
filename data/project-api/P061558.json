The Additional Financing will help finance the costs associated with: (1) rehabilitating water distribution systems in secondary towns, which could not be fully implemented under the current project due to an unanticipated financial gap; and (2) providing about 5,000 new private connections to the water distribution network, 70 public standpipes and 1,500 household latrines as a result of the strong additional demand from the population. No changes to the objectives or general design and implementation modalities of the project are being proposed. The Additional Financing will be used to address a financing gap under the current IDA-financed project and scale up the project's impact and development effectiveness."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Niger!$!NE","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":87},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"48,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Project Paper,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"NE","sectorcode":"BZ,WA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"71,85,57,78,40","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,10,7,11,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":87},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20101203002524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20101203002524","DocDate":"29-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"007333729_2007061910391529","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007333729_2007061910391529","DocURL":"14-DEC-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"007333729_2007061910391529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007333729_2007061910391529","DocDate":"14-DEC-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000160016_20060627093007","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060627093007","DocDate":"30-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201203413","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201203413","DocURL":"08-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201203514","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201203514","DocURL":"08-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01041811102640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01041811102640","DocDate":"09-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000112742_20060321142534","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060321142534","DocDate":"01-DEC-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Niger","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
