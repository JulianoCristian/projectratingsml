The project is aimed at protecting the small but significant institutional gains made to date in the sector, as well as preventing deterioration in maintenance equipment and the road network itself, while discussions between the Government, the IMF and the Association proceed on a request for assistance in preparing an overall plan for reform of the economy, including financing of road maintenance. The main project risk would be the failure of the financial arrangements concerning the Road Fund. Should sufficient funds not be forthcoming, road maintenance operations would have to be reduced, either in extent or in duration."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"17,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925055333","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925055333","DocDate":"15-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04555_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04555_1_0","DocDate":"03-MAR-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
