Specifically, the project will pilot innovative measures to scale up the provision of safe water supply free from arsenic and pathogens in rural areas and small towns. There are 7 project components. Component 1 promotes private-sector participation for rural piped water supply. Component 2 promotes private-sector participation in water supply in municipalities (pourashavas). Component 3 implements arsenic mitigation measures in small arsenic-affected villages. Component 4 supports development of adequate regulations, monitoring, capacity building, and training. Component 5 supports the development of a local credit market and risk mitigation mechanisms for village piped water supply. Component 6 implements a monitoring and evaluation system for the project. Component 7 funds project management."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME
