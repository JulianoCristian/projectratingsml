The components will: 1) support the review, development, and implementation of policies, which define the funding, and allocation of resources to health services. Technical assistance, capacity building, and extensive consultations with stakeholders, will be implemented, particularly to improve the Department of Health capacity, in the identification, testing, and implementation of mechanisms for health financing, and improve the management of public expenditures for overseas care. Health care legislation and regulation will be strengthened, and support will be provided for communication, and introduction of policies, and legislation; and, 2) support four elements of quality improvement for the Samoa health sector reform: improve facilities planning; improve quality of key infrastructure; develop a health care waste management system; and, provide grants for innovative quality improvement pilots. These activities will be implemented in conjunction with the institutional strengthening component, based on legislative, and resource requirements."},"country_namecode":"Samoa!$!WS","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"WS","sectorcode":"BG,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"33,67,57","mjthemecode":"7,8,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":78},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":21},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070724102714","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070724102714","DocDate":"26-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201161824","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201161824","DocDate":"26-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201162126","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201162126","DocDate":"26-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201161824","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201161824","DocURL":"26-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201162025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201162025","DocDate":"26-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00082905303681","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082905303681","DocDate":"24-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9912140530519","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9912140530519","DocDate":"26-JUN-2000"}],"countryname":"Samoa"}},"facets":{}}
