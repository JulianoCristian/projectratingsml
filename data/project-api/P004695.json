Under the project, electricity will reach an estimated 675,000 households and a population of about 5 million spread over about 3,825 villages in 16 provinces in the Northeast, and about 740 villages in 4 provinces (Chiang Mai, Nakhon Sawan, Chonburi, and Songkhla), located respectively in the Northern, Central, Eastern and Southern regions of Thailand. The project villages have been selected because of their high population density, their proximity to roads and power lines and their role as market and service centers for the surrounding less populated and comparatively remote villages. The project includes (a) construction of 1,660 km of 22/33 kv 3 phase main primary lines and 9,820 km of 22 kv, 1 phase primary line taps; (b) 2,030 km of the existing 3 phase 22 kv primary lines to be replaced with new conductors; (c) construction of 7,340 km of secondary lines (460/230v); (d) installation of 5,370 distribution transformers, 381,300 kwh meters, 31,000 streetlights; and (e) supply of lightening arrestors, fuses, switches, feeder reclosures and the necessary vehicles."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925015528","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925015528","DocDate":"13-JUN-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f6e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f6e_1_0","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f6d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f6d_1_0","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902295286","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902295286","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
