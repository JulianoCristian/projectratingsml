Towards this end, the grant supports institution building and the strengthening of economic governance in sectors critical to reconstruction and growth in the short and medium term. The grant is a single tranche operation that builds on the institutional foundations laid under the past series of Development Policy Grant (DPGs), some of which were stalled or reversed by the earthquake. The earthquake increased the urgency to address Haiti's deep structural problems of weak economic governance and inefficient and nontransparent public resource use. The significant inflow of reconstruction funds not only created pressure on the existing capacity to manage and use funds, but also increased demand for better economic governance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Haiti!$!HT","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":56},"sector2":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":56},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Document,Summary of Discussion,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"HT","sectorcode":"FA,BZ,LT,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,27,30","mjthemecode":"2,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":56},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":28},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b0824b51ad_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0824b51ad_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081f44f79_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081f44f79_1_0","DocDate":"01-OCT-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"090224b081df338e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081df338e_1_0","DocDate":"27-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20140211105526","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20140211105526","DocDate":"26-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000445729_20130702104342","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130702104342","DocDate":"26-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000333037_20130628104303","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130628104303","DocDate":"18-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000445729_20130530100927","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130530100927","DocDate":"15-MAY-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000442464_20140212113650","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20140212113650","DocDate":"29-FEB-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000442464_20140212114159","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20140212114159","DocDate":"29-FEB-2012"}],"countryname":"Republic of Haiti"}},"facets":{}}
