It will also increase the access of disadvantaged groups - i.e., women, and rural youth - to technician education, and training. The components will: 1) develop and expand capacity, by establishing six new educational polytechnics, and a skill development center. Furthermore, existing polytechnics will be strengthened , with the introduction of new programs. Continuing education, and non-formal training programs, will be introduced per industry requirements, and community needs, providing student, and faculty housing facilities; 2) enhance the quality of education, by modernizing existing laboratories, and workshops, developing, and revising curricula to meet labor market needs, and entrepreneurial requirements. Learning resources will be improved, promoting interaction with industry, and community members; and, 3) improve efficiency of state boards, council, or directorates in dealing with technician education, by conducting research studies for systemic reforms, instituting computer-based project, and financial management systems, and providing substantial academic, and financial autonomy to project polytechnics."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government
