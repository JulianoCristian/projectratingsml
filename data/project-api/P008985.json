There are three components in this project.  First, institutional development consists of strengthening the CALBIR (Cesme-Alacati Union) by setting up the Union's technical and financial management systems; hiring and monitoring the performance of a private operator for improved water and sewerage services; and providing technical assistance for a high level of project supervision and on environmental issues.  Second, improving the operational condition of the water supply system will support hydrogeological investigations to increase water production of the wells in the Ildir area; relocation of wells in the Ildir area; construction of a water barrier; provision of operational equipment to improve water and wastewater services; and provision for urgent repairs and upgrading of the water supply system.  Third, completion of sewerage system will develop and improve the sewerage network; construct a pre-treatment plant for the combined waste water flow from Cesme and Alacati to discharge into the sea."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":35},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"13,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"WC,WS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,84,71","mjthemecode":"9,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":65},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":35}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050701122441","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050701122441","DocDate":"22-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200362604","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200362604","DocURL":"08-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200363106","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200363106","DocURL":"08-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200363005","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200363005","DocURL":"08-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980429111309","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429111309","DocDate":"19-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184610","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184610","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0002050530267","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0002050530267","DocDate":"30-NOV-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
