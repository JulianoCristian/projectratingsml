The project consists of a single tranche operation, based on up-front, completed actions that demonstrate substantive progress toward medium-term objectives. It builds on, and deepens the cross-cutting reforms undertaken under the first DPL operation, and sets out mutually agreed upon triggers for the upcoming third DPL. Key benefits include: 1) Progress toward government's medium-term objectives of a) macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness; b) improved investment climate; and, c) public financial management. 2) Sustained Bank engagement in policy dialogue with the Government on the direction and content of, and strategies for, its economic, structural, and institutional reform agenda. 3) Donor harmonization (the Bank, Government of Japan, Asian Development Bank) around a common policy framework and dialogue. 4) Critical signaling effect and key endorsement by donors of the Government's sound economic management and policy implementation. However several risks exist, that is, a worsening economic volatility, rising interest rates, increased social tensions, fiduciary and reputation risks, deteriorating external environment, and the growing fears of a bird-flu epidemic."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Other non-bank financial intermediaries","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":16},"theme3":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme5":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"400,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other non-bank financial intermediaries"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BH,FZ,FL,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Economic management","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"41,27,21,54,40","mjthemecode":"4,6,1,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other non-bank financial intermediaries","code":"FL"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":55},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090814012029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090814012029","DocDate":"30-JAN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010031514115787","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031514115787","DocDate":"19-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010031514115787","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031514115787","DocURL":"19-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20051129123116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051129123116","DocDate":"18-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20051219100143","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20051219100143","DocDate":"09-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20051025092048","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051025092048","DocDate":"19-OCT-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
