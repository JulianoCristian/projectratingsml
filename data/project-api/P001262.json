Major components include treatment and transmission facilities, trunk mains, pumping stations, and distribution systems. The project also provides for training of staff of the Water and Sewerage Department (WSD) of NCC, technical assistance for improving the accounting and financial management system for water supply and sewerage operations, and consulting engineering services for detailed design and construction supervision. On completion in 1981, the project will serve a population of about 1,070,000 -- an increase of about 80 percent over the population currently served. There are no special risks, although slower growth in water demand could result in excess capacity and a reduced rate of return, and deterioration in WSD's staff position could have adverse effects on operations."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000009265_3961214133858","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214133858","DocDate":"25-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925015228","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925015228","DocDate":"28-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902294469","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902294469","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f58_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f58_1_0","DocDate":"14-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f57_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f57_1_0","DocDate":"14-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912185322","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912185322","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
