The components will: 1) strengthen eligible micro-finance institutions within the country's less developed rural-urban markets, through innovative approaches for local businesses, to gain reliable access to commercially priced working capital, and investment credit, and secure as well savings facilities; 2) promote increased access to information communications technology-based business development services, to enable participating micro-businesses to access new markets, and increase income. Business application, databases, and business management, and planning tools will be developed to match local needs; in addition, training, and programs will be provided for the use of ICT in business development services; and, 3) design, and implement monitoring, and evaluation systems, supported by consulting services, and, will as well finance the incremental costs of equipment, and software needed for this purpose. Project management, administration, and coordination will be financed, as will the necessary training to ensure widespread participation in project activities by civil society."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Agreement","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"FA,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"41","mjthemecode":"4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":80},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050330084944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050330084944","DocDate":"07-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201560212","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201560212","DocURL":"21-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201560514","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201560514","DocURL":"21-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201560413","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201560413","DocURL":"21-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01101604041842","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01101604041842","DocDate":"26-SEP-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01032007115429","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032007115429","DocDate":"27-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042313284571","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042313284571","DocDate":"10-JAN-2001"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
