The project's components are three: 1) The Distribution Extension component will finance lower-cost extension of the distribution grid in rural areas and small towns, as well as a subtransmission system to electrify areas; 2) The Off-Grid Rural Electrification component will pilot standalone electricity systems including renewable energy technologies, and will develop a national plan for off-grid rural electrification; and 3) the Institution Building component will support EDL in project management and commercialization, and will provide assistance to the government in sector planning and further commercialization."},"country_namecode":"Lao People's Democratic Republic!$!LA","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":82},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":11},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"34,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Renewable energy"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Brief,Brief,Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"LA","sectorcode":"LE,BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"34,40,81,78,39","mjthemecode":"4,10,11,4,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":82},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20080508034821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080508034821","DocDate":"04-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150218124703","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150218124703","DocDate":"08-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150218123616","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150218123616","DocDate":"08-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150218122646","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150218122646","DocDate":"08-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050721091638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050721091638","DocDate":"14-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123481060","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123481060","DocURL":"29-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123481261","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123481261","DocURL":"29-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429111603","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429111603","DocDate":"24-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929100840","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929100840","DocDate":"31-OCT-1997"}],"countryname":"Lao People's Democratic Republic"}},"facets":{}}
