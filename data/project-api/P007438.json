The project is designed to minimize the annual foreign exchange requirements for the operation of vehicles in the KMR and to rationalize and reduce in real terms Government expenditures in the urban transport sector. The project comprises the following major components: (i) traffic management measures, including steps for improving traffic flow along the three most heavily travelled public transport corridors in the KMR, intersection improvements, and traffic signals; (ii) support for the 7 1/2-year road maintenance program in the KMR; and (iii) technical assistance and training to assist in the execution of the project and to improve management of the KMR urban transport system."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban transport","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"16,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban transport"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"JM","sectorcode":"TU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban transport","code":"TU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019133255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019133255","DocDate":"26-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99957_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99957_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902435033","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902435033","DocDate":"29-FEB-1984"}],"countryname":"Jamaica"}},"facets":{}}
