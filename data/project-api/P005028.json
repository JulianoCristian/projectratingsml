In addition, the project includes a bilharzia component to consolidate the national program and to expand the control program into the project area and Giza Governorate. Major project benefits include provision of agricultural land and increased incomes for 4,000 low income farm families and unquantifiable benefits of increasing the control of bilharzia. The major risk is whether the actual management and organization of the project will be adequate. The design of the project with a staged development, simple irrigation system, and three tiered organizational structure (Central Coordinating Committee, Project Unit, and Regional Implementation Committee) should minimize this risk. Assurances were also obtained that the government would ensure the timely availability of adequate funds."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04520_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04520_1_0","DocDate":"16-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902363141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902363141","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912502475","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912502475","DocDate":"31-OCT-1980"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
