In addition, the project provides for three instructors for two years for the handicraft center. A major increase in operating costs, unmatched by revenue increases, is the principal project risk. This, however, will imply an unlikely decline in hotel operating efficiency."},"country_namecode":"Dominican Republic!$!DO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other urban development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other urban development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"DO","sectorcode":"UY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other urban development","code":"UY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924213446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924213446","DocDate":"30-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902324084","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902324084","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e4a9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e4a9_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e4a8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e4a8_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e8e4a7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e4a7_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Dominican Republic"}},"facets":{}}
