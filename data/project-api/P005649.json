It consists of investments in: irrigation infrastructure; farm access roads; credit; the support services of ODTC and OMIVAK; aquifer monitoring equipment; a pilot livestock development program and animal production support services; studies for future investments in the project area; training; and technical assistance. About 12,000 families would benefit overall, and about 1,500 additional jobs would be created. Improved marketing infrastructure and information systems to be provided under the project would minimize the risk of temporary over-supplies of fruits and vegetables with accompanying falls in prices; improvements to the Officers' maintenance units, involvement of farmers in maintenance, maintenance would assure that the rehabilitated irrigation systems are maintained; differential water charges for winter and summer would encourage maximum use of these systems throughout the year."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"16,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925151111","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925151111","DocDate":"17-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000020953_20081222112404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20081222112404","DocDate":"17-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902411022","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902411022","DocDate":"31-JAN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810190100165","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190100165","DocDate":"31-JAN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e97838_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97838_1_0","DocDate":"25-JAN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e97837_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97837_1_0","DocDate":"25-JAN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97835_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97835_1_0","DocDate":"25-JAN-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
