The project components are five. The first universalizes quality primary education by supporting community and school-based projects that improve access and learning outcomes by a) supporting services to prepare, sign, monitor, and evaluate contracts, b) providing quality inputs to improve school management, teaching processes, and staff development; and c) rehabilitating infrastructure and supplying furniture and equipment. The second improves quality of and access to secondary education, particularly in rural areas, by supporting school-based pilot programs with subcomponents similar to those of the first component. The third component improves access to quality textbooks and teacher-learning materials to primary schools by a) producing new titles including teaching guides; b) printing and distributing textbooks and teaching materials; and c) holding in-service teacher training. The fourth component strengthens key functions in the education ministry at central and local levels including educational planning, bi-annual learning assessments and financial management strengthening, and pre-investment studies. The fifth component supports reform of higher education in assisting institutions to modernize and to diversify."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":6},"sector5":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"65,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MG","sectorcode":"ES,BH,ET,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,51,78,57,65","mjthemecode":"8,7,10,6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":65},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Education","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20051028101323","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051028101323","DocDate":"24-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980319095901","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980319095901","DocDate":"13-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185420","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Madagascar"}},"facets":{}}
