The project is intended to: 1) strengthen the planning and institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education, Youth Affairs and Sports (MOE) to guide and carry out the long-term development of the sector, while enabling it to initiate significant, urgent measures to address system-wide qualitative problems and expansion needs at the secondary level; and 2) serve as a catalyst for a major adjustment process, focused on revision to more reasonable levels of primary and secondary teacher to student ratios, in line with ratios of countries of comparable economic and social development. The project comprises three major components: 1) a strengthening management and planning component; 2) a qualitative improvement of basic education component, which will enhance the quality of teaching and learning; and 3) an expansion and conservation of school places component, which will assist MOE to provide more secondary school places in the most under-served districts to reduce long distance travel and facilitate access to educational opportunities."},"country_namecode":"Commonwealth of Dominica!$!DM","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":39},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":39},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"6,140,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DM","sectorcode":"ET,BC,EP,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"themecode":"65,51,25","mjthemecode":"2,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":39},{"Name":"Education","Percent":39},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02061104061182","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02061104061182","DocDate":"17-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122060189","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122060189","DocURL":"14-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122060189","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122060189","DocDate":"14-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122060791","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122060791","DocDate":"14-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122060590","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122060590","DocDate":"14-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122060791","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122060791","DocURL":"14-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122060590","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122060590","DocURL":"14-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e23c17_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23c17_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23c16_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23c16_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb9b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb9b_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb9a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb9a_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019150850","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019150850","DocDate":"29-NOV-1995"}],"countryname":"Commonwealth of Dominica"}},"facets":{}}
