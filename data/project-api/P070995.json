The three components include: 1) provision of performance-based grants, as a mechanism to target non-revenue generating investments to low-income municipalities, and their poor communities, and improve service delivery, cost recovery, financial management capacity of local governments, and public accountability/community participation. Social, and institutional assessment of municipal areas will be conducted, including a financial, and operational assessment of local governments, and, a financial, and operational action plan will be developed; 2) institutional capacity building support, through increased partnerships with communities in identifying, implementing, and maintaining non-revenue generating investments, as a means of strengthening social capital, and governance; and, 3) responsibility for project implementation, between the project implementation units, municipalities, citizen associations, and nongovernmental organizations, while the financial, and procurement management will be institutionally centralized, to better administer common functions."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and
