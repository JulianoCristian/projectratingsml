In supporting these aims the project includes two components. The transport component consists of: (i) a pipeline and related facilities to deliver natural gas to Sao Paulo; (ii) three pipelines to deliver liquified products more economically to distribution centers; (iii) engineering design, environmental impact studies, and training in pipeline operations and transportation planning.  The processing component consists of: (i) a Hydrotreatment Plant at the Cubatao refinery; (ii) automation studies focusing on optimization of process and centralized control for loading, storage and offsite facilities; (iii) an industrial safety and environmental program."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"260,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,39,84,71","mjthemecode":"9,11,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20031211113459","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20031211113459","DocDate":"01-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122463130","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122463130","DocURL":"26-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122462829","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122462829","DocURL":"26-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122463331","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122463331","DocURL":"26-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122463130","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122463130","DocDate":"26-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122463331","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122463331","DocDate":"26-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122462829","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122462829","DocDate":"26-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929141146","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929141146","DocDate":"06-JUN-1991"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
