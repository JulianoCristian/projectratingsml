They will involve (a) support for the privatisation process of livestock service; (b) strengthening of a reduced public livestock service; and (c) provisions of about 19 staff-years of internationally recruited specialists and thirty nine staff-months of short-term consultants. The first component will be achieved through: establishment of herdsmen's associations; creation of an Input Supply Center for livestock inputs; and provision of a small pilot credit component for the establishment of private veterinarians, for setting up animal production farms, for herdsmen's associations, and for distribution of livestock inputs. The second component will be accomplished through: upgrading of the infrastructure of the central livestock department in Conakry and 33 field offices with provision of equipment, vehicles and basic materials; establishment of a training center in Labe with a capacity for 40 students; provision of fellowships for external training of high level staff, and provision of equipment and vehicles for annual national vaccination campaigns."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":33},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"9,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Brief,Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"BC,AJ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,75,43,79","mjthemecode":"10,4,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":67},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":33}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333038_20110208004115","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20110208004115","DocDate":"01-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333038_20110208004537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20110208004537","DocDate":"01-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165902","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165902","DocDate":"19-NOV-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36af7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36af7_1_0","DocDate":"08-JUL-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095055","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095055","DocDate":"30-JUN-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
