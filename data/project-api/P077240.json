The first component will provide resources to maintain, and in some cases increase the delivery of electricity services in N'Djamena and in six smaller urban centers, through the rehabilitation, and expansion of electricity production, transmission, and distribution systems. Expansion, and rehabilitation of water supply systems will be implemented under a second component, likewise in the city of N'Djamena, and in eight smaller urban centers.
