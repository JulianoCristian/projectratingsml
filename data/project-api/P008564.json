More specifically, the project will: start transforming existing rural cooperatives from social sector organizations to member-controlled, market-oriented business enterprises; help develop rural commercial enterprises by improving access to credit; and provide investment funds for business and institutional development in rural communities.  The project comprises:  (i) institution-building activities for about 2,400 rural cooperatives and cooperative banks through:  (a) technical assistance aimed at strengthening individual agricultural cooperatives and primary cooperative banks and creating a suitable apex structure at regional and national levels, and (b) establishment of a Capital Fund for cooperative banks; and (ii) a credit program to provide medium- and long-term credit for investments in agriculture, agroindustry and other rural productive sectors. Farmers, individual entrepreneurs, private cooperatives, private enterprises as well as former state enterprises which have been privatized will be eligible for borrowing."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":28},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":50},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":22},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"FE,YB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,76,75","mjthemecode":"10,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":28},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":50},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":22}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625093640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625093640","DocDate":"30-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200065711","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200065711","DocURL":"10-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200065711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200065711","DocDate":"10-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200065409","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200065409","DocURL":"10-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200065510","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200065510","DocURL":"10-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200065510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200065510","DocDate":"10-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200065409","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200065409","DocDate":"10-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960930211322","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930211322","DocDate":"20-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930211000","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930211000","DocDate":"20-MAY-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland"}},"facets":{}}
