Its total cost is estimated at $2.3 million equivalent and about 110 ranchers are expected to benefit from it. The proceeds of the proposed credit will be applied to long-term loans only and should be committed in twelve months; funds allocated under the 1967 credit to technical services are sufficient to cover their foreign exchange cost through September 30, 1970. Banco Agricola will continue to finance from its own resources the participating ranchers' working capital requirements. The cost of technical services is borne by Banco Agricola."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"1,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20090218013255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090218013255","DocDate":"11-OCT-1974"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903163567","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903163567","DocDate":"31-DEC-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081da56f2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da56f2_1_0","DocDate":"16-DEC-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da56f0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da56f0_1_0","DocDate":"16-DEC-1969"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
