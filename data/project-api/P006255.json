Credit will be available to eligible ranchers (about 700 are expected to participate) to finance on-farm investments such as land clearing, pasture improvement, fencing, watering and handling facilities, farm buildings and machinery, and breeding cattle. Technical assistance for livestock development will also be extended and the project would result in better herd productivity and stock expansion."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"26,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902192388","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902192388","DocDate":"31-DEC-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a984_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a984_1_0","DocDate":"19-DEC-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a982_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a982_1_0","DocDate":"19-DEC-1972"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
