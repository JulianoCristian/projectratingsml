A related objective is to help SONATRACH mobilize external funds through co-financing arrangements with Eximbank of Japan, and more generally, to facilitate SONATRACH's efforts at reentering the international capital markets. The project comprises four components: (i) assistance for the promotion of exploration acreage to foreign oil companies, including basin studies, the setting up of a modern exploration data base, promotional and contractual assistance, and the services of full-time foreign experts; (ii) technical assistance and training in drilling supervision; (iii) selected enhanced oil recovery subprojects and related studies; and (iv) training and other technical assistance \"inter-alia\" in the area of organization, financial systems, planning optimization, and environmental protection."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"49,39","mjthemecode":"4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122473148","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122473148","DocURL":"02-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122472145","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122472145","DocURL":"02-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122472746","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122472746","DocURL":"02-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122472947","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122472947","DocURL":"02-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122472746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122472746","DocDate":"02-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122472947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122472947","DocDate":"02-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122473148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122473148","DocDate":"02-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122472145","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122472145","DocDate":"02-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929052153","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929052153","DocDate":"26-JUN-1991"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
