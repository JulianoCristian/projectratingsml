After 30 years, when the first timber is expected to be felled on saw-wood plantations in the proposed project, about half the output will be absorbed domestically and the other half exported. Ecological advantages and relatively short distance provide comparative marketing advantages in the Near East which is a potentially important market for Kenyan saw-wood. It may also be possible for the project to supply some of the European demand for high quality softwood. The pulpwood plantations, which will be operated on a 14-15 years rotation, will produce raw material for a pulp and paper mill to be located at Broderick Falls near the plantations."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"2,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000334955_20090130041510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090130041510","DocDate":"30-JAN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101911534592","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101911534592","DocDate":"01-MAR-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903162957","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903162957","DocDate":"31-OCT-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e727cb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e727cb_1_0","DocDate":"28-OCT-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67ed4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ed4_1_0","DocDate":"28-OCT-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903194474","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903194474","DocDate":"22-SEP-1969"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
