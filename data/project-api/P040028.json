Specific objectives are to: 1) improve performance by restructuring and concessioning Rede Ferroviara Federal S.A.'s (RFFSA) operations to private operators, and by restructuring its finances to settle debts and labor liabilities; 2) increase productivity through staff retrenchment and emergency rehabilitation of critical assets in order to make the proposed concessions viable, while minimizing the social cost of staff retrenchment; and 3) enhance competition through regulatory reform, with a view to increase the railways market share and reduce freight transport rates. The project will consist of the following six components: 1) operations restructuring and concessioning component; 2) staff retrenchment program; 3) emergency rehabilitation program; 4) environmental management component; 5) regulatory reform component; and 6) financial restructuring and settlement component."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"350,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BC,TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"54,40,43","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,4,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030528100246","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030528100246","DocDate":"16-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200251032","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200251032","DocURL":"17-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200251233","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200251233","DocURL":"17-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200251434","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200251434","DocURL":"17-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214133710","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214133710","DocDate":"29-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
