Specifically, the project would finance: (a) three new primary teacher training colleges, expansion of one existing college and staff training; (b) 25 new Malawi Correspondence College centers (MCC), other necessary additions to MCC headquarters, technical assistance, and training of MCC staff; (c) one new secondary school and expansion of an existing school; (d) a new college of accountancy and related technical assistance and staff training; and (e) studies, technical assistance and fellowships to the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Auditor General's office. As a result of the project, primary teacher training capacity would be increased by 80 percent and the quality of teaching improved, contributing to significantly improved completion rates. Relatedly, the number of successful MCC students is expected to increase significantly and the need for trained accountants be met through the 1990's. The project would also strengthen the MOE's planning and research capacity and improve the Auditor General's capabilities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"34,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925151242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925151242","DocDate":"23-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e058c0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e058c0_1_0","DocDate":"08-MAR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902411428","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902411428","DocDate":"28-FEB-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901001913","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901001913","DocDate":"31-JAN-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
