The project's principal direct benefits will include: improved coordination and management, thus increased effectiveness and efficiency, of village-level community health (family planning, health and nutrition) services; enhanced national capability to predict and influence changes in nutrition status, strengthened program monitoring and evaluation capacity, and improved food and nutrition policies; and a more adequate stock of trained nutrition manpower for program management and implementation, and for policy formulation and planning."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Targeted health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"33,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Targeted health"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"HT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Targeted health","code":"HT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925232644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925232644","DocDate":"16-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094150","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094150","DocDate":"30-NOV-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095741","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095741","DocDate":"30-NOV-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
