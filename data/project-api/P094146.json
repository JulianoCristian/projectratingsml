This second operation builds on the first operation, and focuses on addressing fiscal issues, and on strengthening the international trade and business environment, for which it will draw on findings set forth in the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), Public Expenditure Review (PER), Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement with the United States of America (DR-CAFTA) studies, as well as the Investment Climate Assessment. It will likewise continue to emphasize transparency, and efficiency in public spending by including follow up actions on public financial management, and procurement regulations to ensure the gradual implementation of measures as prescribed in the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). Nonetheless, risks exist, such as fiscal, political, external - i.e., sustained high oil prices or a new international recession, could negatively affect El Salvador's economy and worsen debt dynamics - as well as natural disasters, and crime and violence."},"country_namecode":"Republic of El Salvador!$!SV","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Segundo Pr\u00e9stamo para Pol\u00edticas de Desarrollo y Crecimiento de Base Amplia</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Credit Reporting and Secured Transactions","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Capital markets"},{"Name":"Credit Reporting and Secured Transactions"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Brief,Brief,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"SV","sectorcode":"FR,FK,FZ,YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"45,28,40,34,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,3,4,2,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"},{"name":"Credit Reporting and Secured Transactions","code":"FR"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":30},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":15},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000334955_20080718034351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080718034351","DocDate":"21-MAR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000470435_20150218095541","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000470435_20150218095541","DocDate":"20-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000470435_20150218095201","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000470435_20150218095201","DocDate":"20-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2010031515011110","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010031515011110","DocURL":"15-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2010031515011110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010031515011110","DocDate":"15-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20051121100807","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051121100807","DocDate":"11-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20051212105249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20051212105249","DocDate":"24-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000021271_20050909101619","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021271_20050909101619","DocDate":"31-AUG-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of El Salvador","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
