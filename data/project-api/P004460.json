In particular, it would develop the capacity of PISO, a private financial institution, to initiate and expand its medium- and long-term lending operations. The proposed loan will be used by PISO for making sub-loans to finance foreign exchange requirements of projects mainly in manufacturing. In addition to the institutional improvements for which this project provides, there are a number of financial and industrial sector issues which the Government would need to address within the next few years. The effectiveness of PISO in mobilizing and allocating financial (particularly local) resources will, to an important degree, depend on the policy adjustments which the Government makes in the coming years. Apart from these broader sectoral concerns, there are no special risks associated with the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial adjustment"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"FF","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial adjustment","code":"FF"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902303251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902303251","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191238105","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191238105","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c63_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c63_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c61_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c61_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c60_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c60_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e84c5d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c5d_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
