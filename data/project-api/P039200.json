The first phase is to demonstrate cost-effective measures in the electricity sub-sector through load management and targeted peak period reductions so as to better utilize existing facilities; demonstrate the same to reduce energy use in public, residential, commercial, and industrial facilities; enhance standards and labeling programs; and set up a market-based support structure for energy service companies. Project components will consist of Demonstration Projects as follows: 1) Proper electricity price signals and service options will target selected electricity energy markets to test and demonstrate innovative demand charge and time-of-day-tariffs, load demand limiters, options in service conditions, and other commercial actions. 2) Delivery mechanisms for dissemination of emerging technologies will test delivery mechanisms to increase the use of more efficient appliances, equipment, and operational practices."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"43,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84","mjthemecode":"11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000020953_20070821121346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070821121346","DocDate":"15-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200422149","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200422149","DocURL":"05-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200421847","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200421847","DocDate":"05-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200422048","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200422048","DocURL":"05-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200422048","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200422048","DocDate":"05-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200422149","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200422149","DocDate":"05-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99030406324075","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99030406324075","DocDate":"20-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99092110080485","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99092110080485","DocDate":"14-SEP-1999"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
