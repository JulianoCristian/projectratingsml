The project consists of three components: 1) Social and economic infrastructure subprojects will support a wide range of small, medium and large-scale subprojects for the expansion and improvement of basic social and economic infrastructure, as well as the provision of training in operation and maintenance of the facilities. The subprojects will be identified by poor communities, implemented with the assistance of an implementing partner, and coordinated with local government representatives, nongovernmental organizations, and sectoral agencies. They are related to education, health, water and sanitation, small-scale community infrastructure, and environmental infrastructure. 2) Capacity building will go beyond pursuing community participation in its operation by supporting independent civil society through training programs to strengthen the institutional and managerial capacity of local organizations. 3) Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation system (M&E) will a) capitalize on the existing strengths of the M&E system and project cycle of FAS I, and b) address the areas for improvements and gaps that were identified at the end of FAS I."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Angola!$!AO","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":11},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"AO","sectorcode":"JA,JB,WA,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"58,78,51,56,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,6,6,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":35},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040907105040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040907105040","DocDate":"17-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00102005304299","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00102005304299","DocDate":"31-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201150175","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201150175","DocURL":"17-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201150175","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201150175","DocDate":"17-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051816320750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051816320750","DocDate":"17-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929102213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929102213","DocDate":"01-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00061605384043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00061605384043","DocDate":"26-MAY-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Angola","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
