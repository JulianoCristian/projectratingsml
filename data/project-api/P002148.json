The maximum irrigation potential will be 100,000 ha, but in practice it is unlikely that this potential will be fully realized, and a conservative assumption of 50,000 ha of irrigation cropping has been used for calculating the project benefits.  In addition to providing for new irrigation, the project will:  (a) privatize drilling; (b) construct fadama and access roads and marketing infrastructure; (c) simplify drilling technology for shallow tubewells, conduct aquifer studies and upgrade irrigation technologies; (d) organize fadama farmers for irrigation management, cost recovery and better access to credit, marketing and other services; and (e) complete a full environmental assessment of future fadama development."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":56},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"67,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"TA,BC,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,25,39","mjthemecode":"4,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":56},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":31},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00021705344142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00021705344142","DocDate":"27-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135319","DocDate":"31-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135322","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135322","DocDate":"31-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135320","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135320","DocDate":"31-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121392484","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121392484","DocURL":"25-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001081149","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001081149","DocDate":"04-FEB-1992"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
