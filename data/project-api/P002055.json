It would strengthen NBCI as a financial institution, develop its capacity to lend to SMEs, and train federal and state extension workers in the promotion, appraisal, and supervision of SMEs. In addition to credit and training, the project would provide for some further studies concerning the SME subsector, in particular the potential of small contractors. Since this would be the first effort at an integrated approach to SME development in Nigeria, the project could experience some delay in putting in place the proper institutional structure. The project seeks to reduce this risk through the strengthening of NBCI."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"41,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"IL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","code":"IL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925093621","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925093621","DocDate":"22-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a87_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a87_1_0","DocDate":"17-JAN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a85_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a85_1_0","DocDate":"17-JAN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101645","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101645","DocDate":"31-DEC-1983"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
