The project has three components. The first, urban upgrading, finances the design and execution of Communities Neighborhood Improvement Plans (NIP) and includes designing and executing pedestrian and vehicular access, water distribution, sewerage and sanitation, drainage, electricity distribution, public lighting, and community centers as well as building new houses for resettlement. The second component, institutional development, finances the start-up and operational costs for the project management unit, including public dissemination, monitoring and evaluation, and technical assistance and capacity building in several areas. The third component finances the development and operation of a market-based housing improvement loan fund which will provide consumer credit to low-income individuals residing in the barrios to finance improvements to their housing unit, working through a partnership between banks and a non-governmental organization."},"country_namecode":"Republica Bolivariana de
