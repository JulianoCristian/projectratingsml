The project has achieved seismic retrofitting of 40 public buildings, flood protection at all ten project sites, enhancing the safety of six large and small dams, and safety of six tailings management facilities (TMF) at three mines. Thus, all output targets set under component B (seismic risk reduction), component C (flood and landslides risk reduction), and component D (Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin) have been met and even exceeded.  Under component A (strengthening of emergency management and risk financing capacity), the roll-out of the Emergency Management Information System (EMIS) is well underway and its installation in all 48 locations envisaged (exceeding the target of at least 23 locations) would be completed by April 20, 2012, as planned.  Seismic retrofitting of five additional public buildings is underway and should be completed by the current closing date (June 30, 2012).  Installation of the landslides monitoring equipment has been completed and data collection will start soon, to enable finalization of the monitoring manual and hand-over of the equipment and operational guidelines to the relevant public authorities in charge with further monito"},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Flood
