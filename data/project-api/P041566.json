From the demand perspective, the component will support subprojects aiming at developing structures that improve access to basic social services by the community, such as a micro-project promoting the use of technology to preserve milk, enabling its transportation for market sale. On the supply side, the aim is to attract social services providers, such as funding a micro-project for the promotion of a youth-run Information/Education/Communication campaign. The objectives will be phased by setting institutional arrangements, monitoring and evaluation, and scaling up implementation through communal participatory poverty assessments. 2) The micro-finance component will extend financial services focusing on social intermediation, facilitating the creation of savings and credit associations. 3) The capacity building component will organize the most vulnerable groups, through an institutional development phase to set up their operational capacity, financial, and project management abilities. 4) A baseline data and information system will be developed to trace poverty alleviation programs for executing agencies, social fund Boards, Ministries, and donors, and, institutional systems will be created for integration of social funds, within community-based mechanisms."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME
