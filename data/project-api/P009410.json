Included in the project are: a new water intake and treatment plant, six tubewells, modifications to an existing iron removal plant and pumping station to expand its treatment capacity, and associated distribution works. The project provides for about 14,000 service connections with meters, some 1,500 public standpipes and two public water concessions, which are being introduced on an experimental basis. There is also a provision for training and engineering services for project supervision, and for preparation of an appropriate sewerage/sanitation plan. Direct benefits of regularly available wholesome water supplies and improved access to public hydrants will be supplemented by improvements in public health and environmental conditions."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925182852","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925182852","DocDate":"13-AUG-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902344242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902344242","DocDate":"31-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04180_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04180_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228cae_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228cae_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912474583","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912474583","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
