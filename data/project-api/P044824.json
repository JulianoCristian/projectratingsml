The project builds on the very successful social fund component of the on-going Population and Human Resources Project. The Social Fund Project components are: 1) rehabilitation/construction of communal infrastructure for primary schools, health centers, feeder roads, community water supply systems, markets, etc.; 2) micro-credit activities, such as, subproject financing for income generating activities and small loan programs for individuals, as well as groups, particularly women; 3) capacity building subprojects for training of Fonds d'Appui au Developpement Communautaire (FADC)'s partners to improve their effectiveness in identifying, preparing, and implementing community development activities; and 4) training and institution capacity building technical assistance for FADC's investment and operating costs, audits, and studies."},"country_namecode":"Union of the Comoros!$!KM","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":23},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":25},"sector5":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":23},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"11,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"KM","sectorcode":"EP,JB,FE,TA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Urban development","Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,41,51,74,71","mjthemecode":"9,9,6,4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":23},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":23},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":6},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25},{"Name":"Education","Percent":23}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20041228132813","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041228132813","DocDate":"01-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123464195","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123464195","DocURL":"30-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123464296","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123464296","DocURL":"30-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980217141302","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980217141302","DocDate":"30-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052711191557","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052711191557","DocDate":"01-OCT-1996"}],"countryname":"Union of the Comoros"}},"facets":{}}
