The first objective is to improve the financial viability of existing and new dairy operations (about 10,000 HH) in selected areas of Heilongjiang province. The second objective is to demonstrate innovative technologies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase carbon sequestration. The project has four components. The first component is the dairy production development component, which aims to increase the scale, efficiency and quality of milk production in Heilongjiang through household and Dairy Park based production programs. The second is the dairy cattle breed improvement component, which aims at improving the genetic base of the Heilongjiang dairy herd. The third component is the environmental protection and climate change mitigation component. This Italian Trust Fund-funded activity aims to pilot and develop strategies and technologies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon sequestration. The fourth project component is the project management support component, whose purpose would be to improve the management, and monitoring and evaluation of project activities.
