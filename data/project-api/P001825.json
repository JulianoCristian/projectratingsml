Implementation of the project would be carried out in two phases to ultimately increase the present production capacity of 11.5 million tons to about 14 million tons a year by 1984. Although the Guelbs ore is of a different quality (lower iron content) than the Kedia ore, with magnetic concentration the products will actually be of higher grade and will have good marketing characteristics. The main components are: (i) construction of concentration/beneficiation facilities to upgrade the low grade ore (30-40 percent Fe) to an acceptable sinter feed (65 percent Fe); (ii) extension of the railroad from F'Derik to El Rhein (45 km) and increase of existing rail capacity and port facilities to handle 14 million tons of ore per year; (iii) a new power plant, additional water supply, housing and other auxiliary facilities and services; and (iv) engineering, project management and training."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania!$!MR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MR","sectorcode":"NN","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining","code":"NX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","code":"NN"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924220555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924220555","DocDate":"26-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924220505","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924220505","DocDate":"19-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96150_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96150_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUL-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e9614f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9614f_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUL-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9586d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9586d_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUL-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e95dfe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95dfe_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUL-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912420018","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912420018","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902320411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902320411","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100215234332","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100215234332","DocDate":"20-JUN-1979"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania"}},"facets":{}}
