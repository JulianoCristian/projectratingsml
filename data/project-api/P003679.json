The project will help minimize further expansion of the diesel generating capacity, with corresponding savings in foreign exchange which will otherwise be required for importing fuel. The foreign exchange savings at current prices are expected to be about US$180 million during the life of the project. Additional benefits will arise from an institutional reform of Fiji's power sector and a stabilization of electricity tarfiffs which will make electricity more affordable for rural customers. The risks associated with the project are those inherent in all hydroelectric projects, such as possible geological problems and hydrological uncertainties, but the investigations carried out indicate that they will be minimal. The Asian development Bank (ADB) is expected to finance as a separate project the transmission facilities necessary to market the energy produced by the proposed project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Fiji!$!FJ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"FJ","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925023215","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925023215","DocDate":"31-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e33d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e33d_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e33c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e33c_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190231055","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190231055","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912374259","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912374259","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Fiji"}},"facets":{}}
