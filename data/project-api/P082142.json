There are two project components: Component 1: This component supports nine eligible expenditure programs across five key line sectors: health, education, water & sanitation, water source management and environment. It establishes performance benchmarks for each and for a sixth sector, public sector management, which emphasize results-based and fiscal management.  Component 2: This technical assistance component supports primarily the public sector management umbrella sector but will improve Government management across all sectors.
