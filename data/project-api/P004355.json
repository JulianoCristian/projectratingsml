The project will also establish a Government-owned transport company to serve the smallholders. Not included in the project but crucial to its success, is the concurrent establishment of a nucleus estate and factory to process both smallholders and estate production. The nucleus estate/factory complex is being financed by the Government and the Commonwealth Development Corporation. The project also includes a technical assistance component which provides funds for the employment of key expatriate personnel (24 man-years in all) for the smallholder project and for a consultant (2 man-years) to establish training programs for DASF and PNGDB staff in smallholder credit operations."},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine!$!PG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PG","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902270540","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902270540","DocDate":"31-OCT-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b9d7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b9d7_1_0","DocDate":"19-OCT-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101911175567","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101911175567","DocDate":"30-SEP-1976"}],"countryname":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine"}},"facets":{}}
