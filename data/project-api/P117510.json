The ERSG IV operation aims to reinforce and operationalize reforms begun during ERSG II and III and will support the government to continue reforms in: (i) the public finance management system to improve accountability and transparency in public spending; and (ii) the business environment to foster private sector-led growth, particularly in the export crop subsector. At the conclusion of the ERSG IV-V programmatic series, tangible progress with respect to each component of the reform program is expected, including: (i) measurable improvements in public finance management; (ii) measurable improvements in the environment for private sector development, including as relates to the constraints posed by the energy sector; and (iii) progress in the liberalization of the productive sector, including the execution of the reform program in the coffee and tea sectors."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Burundi!$!BI","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":58},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":8},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":8},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Summary of Discussion,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BI","sectorcode":"LZ,YZ,BZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Urban development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"27,71,78,43","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,10,9,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":58},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":17},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20131015101536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20131015101536","DocDate":"23-SEP-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000362596_2011030211390397","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000362596_2011030211390397","DocDate":"04-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000333038_20101214020132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20101214020132","DocDate":"09-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20101105140307","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20101105140307","DocDate":"27-SEP-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Burundi","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
