The following are components to the project: Component I (a): Community Development (CD). Applying a CDD approach, this component would finance local initiatives to build and restore social and economic infrastructure based on communities' own identification, prioritization, implementation and maintenance of small-scale sub-projects. It will expand and improve access, management and sustainable use of basic social and economic infrastructure, improve governance and build social capital. The CD component will give increasing control over decisions and resources to community groups and local level institutions, including local government; build organizational capacity, and develop accountability mechanisms between communities and formal support institutions. Component I(b): Conflict Impact and Vulnerability Assessment (CIVA). Component I (a) fosters human capital building by bringing communities together to design and implement physical capital rehabilitation, and by building community capacity. However, at the time of project preparation, it is uncertain how the particularity of the post-conflict context constrains or fosters social capital building, which is one of the principal project development objectives. Component II: Municipal Development (MD). The MD component will contribute towards the achievement of the twin overall objectives of the FAS III program by assisting municipal governments (including municipal administrations and municipal councils) with capacity development and financial resources to become proficient in the provision of social and economic services to communities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
