This objective will be achieved by a higher level of private investment and better quality and access of services in the telecommunication, water, electricity, and transport sectors; divestiture and improved efficiency of remaining public enterprises; and strengthening the regulatory framework and institutions in relevant sectors. There are three main components. The first builds capacity for privatization by providing technical assistance and on-the-job training to help the government design and implement the privatization program; and funds a communication program; environmental audits and severance payments and redeployment support. The second component strengthens the finance ministry's oversight of public enterprises by providing technical assistance and support and training. The third component facilitates utility sector reform by supplying technical assistance to implement reform strategies, establish and strengthen regulatory agencies, and provide training and experts to advise in regulating the stage devoted for local capacity building."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government
