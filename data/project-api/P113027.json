There are three components to the project; the first component of the project is the local development support. This component helps to improve the socioeconomic conditions, increase the productivity of the natural resource base, and increase incomes of the population in the communes supported by the project. Achieving these goals requires putting in place various infrastructures and socioeconomic investments. This component will channel grants to communes to co-finance Communal Development plans (CDP) preparation activities or CDP-subprojects, as the case may be. The second component of the project is the decentralization support for communes. This component strengthens the institutional capacities in support to the decentralization process. It will also provide assistance for the implementation of capacity building activities for communes and other local stakeholders, such as local service providers, multidisciplinary teams of the sectoral ministries and technical service providers to enable them to assume an effective role as promoters of local development. Finally, the third component of the project is the coordination, management, monitoring and evaluation, and communication. This component facilitates: (a) administrative, technical, and financial management of the program; (b) coordination among all institutional partners to ensure efficient support to communes for local development; (c) effective contractual arrangements with communes, sectoral ministries, including acquisition of the equipment necessary for implementing the program; and (d) monitoring and evaluation of the performance and the financial,"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cameroon!$!CM","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectAbstract>La Deuxi\u00e8me phase du Projet d\u2019appui au programme national de d\u00e9veloppement participatif au Cameroun a pour objectif d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la prestation de services sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s dans les communaut\u00e9s vis\u00e9es, de renforcer le processus en cours de d\u00e9centralisation et de rendre les collectivit\u00e9s locales mieux \u00e0 m\u00eame de financer, ainsi que de planifier, les activit\u00e9s qui leur incombent.
