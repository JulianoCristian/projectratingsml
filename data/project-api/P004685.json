These areas located throughout the Northeast Region have been selected on the basis of farmer interest, cattle concentrations and proximity of breeding stations that would be centers of technical assistance. Research and production facilities of five Livestock Development Department breeding stations and the two substations in the Northeast would be expanded. To meet the immediate needs of the loaned bull and artificial insemination programs, it is proposed to import 300 Brahman bulls and 600 Brahman cows for research and production and to expand the loaned bull program by 455 bulls at full development. To meet the projected expansion of the artificial insemination program to service 72,000 additional cows annually by the fifth year, it is proposed to import 144,000 doses of Brahman and holsteinfriesian semen. For improving disease control, expanded facilities for vaccine production would be established. Technical assistance to the project would be provided."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902245077","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902245077","DocDate":"31-JAN-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e72635_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e72635_1_0","DocDate":"27-JAN-1976"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
