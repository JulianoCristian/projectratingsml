The project would provide for market and feasibility studies necessary to support moves toward adoption of new product lines, and to assist in the elaboration of GOB's strategy for the further development of the textile sector. The project would also provide training in order to relieve the shortage of adequately trained techno-managerial manpower. The project would face no unusual technical risks. Perceived weaknesses in the plan preparation and appraisal capacity of BSB and BSRS have been addressed."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190244308","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190244308","DocDate":"31-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228ce5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228ce5_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c27_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c27_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c1e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c1e_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1984"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
