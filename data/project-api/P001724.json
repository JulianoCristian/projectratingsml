It will first: (a) help remove some of the major citywide infrastructure constraints to the efficient functioning of Bamako; (b) facilitate private sector housing and construction activities; (c) improve local resource mobilization; and (d) strengthen the capacity of key urban institutions.  The project, itself, will finance several components. They include: (a) road rehabilitation and reconstruction both in the city center and the main access roads to the city center; (b) land development and tenure regularization in various locations totalling about 2,000 ha and 30,000 plots; (c) technical assistance, training, studies, and equipment for the District of Bamako, the Ministry of Interior and the Project Unit.
