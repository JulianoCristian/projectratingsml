In this sector that offers promising investment opportunities, it will assist in the application of the policy measures designed to create an enabling environment and increase the operational context for private sector activities.  The project will include the following strategies: (a) institution building, by strengthening professional organizations dealing with the export sector; (b) support to export production, by providing specialized technical services (research, extension, management assistance, etc.) to producers (small and large, including producer groups and cooperatives); this component will include access roads to open up producing areas; (c) special programs, (Mutual Credit and Private Investment Fund schemes) addressing financial constraints to agricultural exports; and (d) project management, through a project management contract with a private consultant firm (the \"Project Manager\") that will have full delegation of authority to implement the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":19},"sector4":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":16},"sector5":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"20,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General finance sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"FZ,TA,BC,YA,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Rural development","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"45,76,49","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"5,10,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":16},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030707135108","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030707135108","DocDate":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121122743","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121122743","DocURL":"06-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121122844","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121122844","DocDate":"06-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121122743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121122743","DocDate":"06-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121122844","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121122844","DocURL":"06-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e120ed_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e120ed_1_0","DocDate":"02-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e120ec_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e120ec_1_0","DocDate":"02-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002014416","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002014416","DocDate":"29-MAY-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
