On May 12, 2008, the Wenchuan Earthquake hit the province of Sichuan. It was the most damaging earthquake since the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake and resulted in almost 70,000 causalities, extensive damage and economic losses across the province. Among the 4 cities of the SUDP, Mianyang was the most affected by the earthquake. As a result, the Mianyang Municipal Government received substantial support from the national government for recovery and reconstruction activities. Land use plans were changed to accommodate affected population and economic activities. Domestic funds were used for infrastructure investments originally under the SUDP in both the Southern Economic Development Zone ('SEDZ') and Pioneer Park. The Mianyang Government is to allocate the unused SUDP funds, totaling US$ 11.8 million, to infrastructure investments in the Xinglong Area of Pioneer Park. The changes will not affect the overall project development objective (PDO), but will require some adjustments to the project result indicators."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
