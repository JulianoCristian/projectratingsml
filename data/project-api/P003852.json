This will be accomplished by: (a) development of new graduate-level programs in selected fields of study and research; (b) initiation of five specialized undergraduate fields of study which are currently not available in Indonesia; and (c) strengthening of overall university planning and management. The project will finance about 845 graduate fellowships; about 1,000 research grants; about 3,000 differing prototype instructional materials; facilities and equipment for 16 inter-university graduate education centers; and related technical assistance. The main benefits of the project will be to increase the proportion of university teachers holding advanced degrees from 15% to 35%; improve the quality of educational materials, teaching methods and research; and increase management capacity for administration and planning of higher education."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"147,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007193456","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007193456","DocDate":"27-OCT-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101228","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101228","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702140412","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702140412","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
