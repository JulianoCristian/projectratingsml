The project comprises: (a) technical assistance for key departments at MOH, including the Health Manpower Institute (HMI) which has the responsibility of training middle-level health workers; and (b) infrastructure development, particularly for manpower training, including civil works, equipment and supplies. The proposed project's main benefits would be: (i) the strengthening of MOH's planning, management and implementation capacity, particularly for its basic health services/primary health care (BHS/PHC) program; and (ii) the development, through HMI, of health manpower to staff BHS/PHC services and facilities. Project risks relate to: (i) retention of MOH staff; (ii) timely recruitment of qualified experts; and (iii) possible continued underutilization of HMI facilities. These risks are minimized by the strong Government commitment to this project, evidenced by specific measures which the Government has taken."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"HB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Basic health","code":"HB"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902403359","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902403359","DocDate":"30-SEP-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05b86_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05b86_1_0","DocDate":"28-SEP-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912582589","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912582589","DocDate":"31-AUG-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
