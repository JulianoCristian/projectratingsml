More specifically it will: i) diversify the higher education system in order to improve the output of a trained technical and managerial labor force; ii) provide incentives to universities to revise curricula to enhance the quality of teaching and learning; and iii) strengthen the planning and managerial capacities of the higher education system. Project components include the creation of a new generation of Higher Institutes of Technology (ISET) which would be geared towards labor market needs.  Five ISETS would be developed in the main economic and industrial regions (Tunis, Nabeul, Gabes, Sfax, and Sousse). The ISETS would limit enrollment to 1500 - 1800 students per ISET and use curricula with disciplines related to local industry and service sectors. Another component would create a National Program for University Improvement (PNRU).  This program would channel funds towards existing universities with the aim of increasing their internal and external efficiency, allowing resources to be used as an incentive for universities to reform their programs and curricula.  Reforms would include: new undergraduate study programs; diversification of streams to increase career options; and improvement of secondary teachers training programs.  The last component involves strengthening the planning and managerial capacities of the higher education system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"75,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"66","mjthemecode":"8,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02061709155660","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02061709155660","DocDate":"31-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122500023","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122500023","DocURL":"11-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122495922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122495922","DocDate":"11-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122495922","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122495922","DocURL":"11-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122500023","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122500023","DocDate":"11-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002041419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002041419","DocDate":"27-FEB-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002041552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002041552","DocDate":"11-FEB-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
