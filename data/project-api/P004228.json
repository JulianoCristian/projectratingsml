The third stages at Port Dickson comprises three new units (Units 5 to 7) each of 120 MW and will bring the station to its final total capacity of 600 MW. The civil works for all three units would be carried out together and two of the three 120 MW units (Units 5 and 6) would be in operation in 1974 to meet the conservatively estimated increase in power demand by that time. The third unit would be installed within two years thereafter to meet growth in power demand as it develops. NEB intends to order all three units at once, retaining the option to cancel the third unit should future demand projections show that it will not be needed as soon as presently planned. A new order would then be placed for a third unit to be installed in time to meet the revised load forecast."},"country_namecode":"Malaysia!$!MY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MY","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a5dc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a5dc_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUL-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a5db_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a5db_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUL-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903173366","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903173366","DocDate":"30-JUN-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903331225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903331225","DocDate":"30-JUN-1970"}],"countryname":"Malaysia"}},"facets":{}}
