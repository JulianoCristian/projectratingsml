The additional loan will help finance the costs associated with the further scaling-up of activities in order to enhance the impact of this well-performing project, starting early in 2007, sooner than had been envisaged when the Project was prepared and negotiated. No changes are envisioned for the design or implementation arrangements of the Project. The Additional Financing will continue to finance conditional cash transfers to poor families linked to compliance with key human development conditionalities. These include: a) assuring that children 0-6 have all vaccinations and growth monitoring controls, according to the Ministry of Social Protection protocols; and b) assuring that children 7-17 years of age are enrolled in schools and regularly attend classes. The Additional Financing will enable the Program to expand the current number of beneficiaries (nearly 600,000) to about 1 million by financing the associated bimonthly transfer payments to poor families. The Bank loan will continue to be used to finance only those households targeted using the proxy means instrument while national resources will be used to finance beneficiaries who are displaced persons, individuals affected by violence (not included in the figures above)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de redes de seguridad social en Colombia</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"86,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Indigenous Peoples Plan,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Indigenous Peoples Plan,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"themecode":"65,56,54,63,30","mjthemecode":"2,8,6,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000386194_20110628013012","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110628013012","DocDate":"21-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090811233307","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090811233307","DocDate":"29-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000020953_20070228090648","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070228090648","DocDate":"15-FEB-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2006031713501612","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006031713501612","DocURL":"23-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20051013094615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20051013094615","DocDate":"03-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000011823_20050701115751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000011823_20050701115751","DocDate":"30-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000021271_20050613171936","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021271_20050613171936","DocDate":"13-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000012009_20050617160444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050617160444","DocDate":"01-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20050401101551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050401101551","DocDate":"29-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20050314102923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050314102923","DocDate":"22-FEB-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
