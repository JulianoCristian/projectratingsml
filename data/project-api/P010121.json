It provides for an increase in the number of extension staff; buildings and equipment for five adaptive research farms; suitable housing and vehicles for service extension staff; 30 heavy wheeled tractors to carry out soil and water conservation work; sprayers with suitable specifications for the project area; and consultant assistance. The main project benefit will be an increase in production as a consequence of the impact of the new extension and research system on agricultural yields. Marginal and small farmers, now living close to or below the poverty line will be the primary beneficiaries of the new system and of the project's emphasis on efficient use of existing resources. The most significant risk lies in the fact that the effectiveness of the new extension methodology is highly dependent on an efficient organization and management of extension and research services, as well as on farmers' response. Experience with ongoing projects in other countries has already demonstrated, however, that the new system can work efficiently in formulation and delivery of messages, and in motivating farmers."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902305792","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902305792","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912381513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912381513","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081df56f2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081df56f2_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228be4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228be4_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
