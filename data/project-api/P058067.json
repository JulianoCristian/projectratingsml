The project development objective is to increase service coverage and achieve effective and sustained use of water and sanitation services in rural communities. It will improve livelihood, generate time savings that can be used for productive purposes and enhance health and productivity, resulting in significant poverty reduction. The project will also strengthen local governance by empowering local communities to plan, implement and manage their own water and sanitation investments. Finally, the project will support the recently initiated peace process through the inclusion of the North East Provincial Council as one of the beneficiary areas. The project components are: 1) physical investments for service improvements; 2) implementation support will finance organizations (POs) to provide assistance for communities; 3) program management and capacity building; and 4) financing for rural water supply and sanitation schemes in the North Provincial Council."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri
