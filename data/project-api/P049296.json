This will further strengthen governance, hence improve business confidence, private sector growth, and poverty alleviation. The project components include: 1) the extension of the Integrated Financial Management Reform (SIGFA), to support the deepening of reforms in financial management sub-systems. Financial management reforms will be extended to central government ministries, and entities, through training, capacity building, and information technology. In line with SIGFA, financial management systems will be available for municipal development, and, public awareness promotion will be supported; 2) deepening of civil service reform to support the recent Civil Service and Administrative Career Law - legislation approval is conditional to disbursement. Capacity building will be reinforced, through technical assistance and training; 3) economic management strengthening, through macroeconomic policy, public investment, and improved social programs, and fiscal policy formulation. Internal operations/services to the public, will be reinforced, to impact economic and investment activities; and, 4) public sector reforms, to implement the Reorganization Law, strengthen public
