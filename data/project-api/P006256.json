The project includes lending to the beneficiaries for: (a) construction, equipping and installation of new, and improvement and expansion of existing, grain storage; and (b) acquisition and installation of grain processing machinery and equipment and other ancillary equipment and supplies required for grain processing and storage. The project will help finance the expansion and improvement of about 1.9 million tons of storage capacity for corn, rice, dry beans, wheat and soybean. Beneficiaries would include farmers, cooperatives, grain processors, warehouse and mixed enterprises. Financing of wheat flour mills, whether for expansion or new construction, would be excluded from the project."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a960_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a960_1_0","DocDate":"05-SEP-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a95f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a95f_1_0","DocDate":"05-SEP-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902191371","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902191371","DocDate":"31-AUG-1972"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
