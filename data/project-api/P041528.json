There are seven project components. The first improves the reliability, quality, quantity, and coverage of water supply services by increasing production capacity to meet demand, increasing the number of connections, restructuring and balancing water distribution, and increasing storage capacity. The second component expands and reinforces drinking water networks. The third component increases the number of households connected to sewer networks, improves demand management and reduces wastewater and septic pollution, and limits severity and duration of flooding. the fourth component targets peri-urban and low-income settlements so as to improve sanitary conditions of households. This component includes an investment program and a capacity building and demand generation program. The fifth component improves the role of the executing agency in regulating water resources and develops an action plan for integrated management. The sixth component incorporates environmental concerns in the project to increase quality, and to follow safeguard policies and national regulations. The seventh component increases the efficiency of public entities involved in the water and sewerage sector by strengthening their capacity and the capacity of small private and community enterprises."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":62},"sector2":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":18},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"125,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Sanitation"}],"docty":"Procurement Plan,Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"WA,WS,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,40,84,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":62},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":18}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20080520000346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080520000346","DocDate":"16-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333037_20081026233710","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20081026233710","DocDate":"01-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100114224634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100114224634","DocDate":"01-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01021705482844","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01021705482844","DocDate":"07-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00072905350321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00072905350321","DocDate":"31-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929174009","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929174009","DocDate":"13-MAY-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
