The components focus on: 1) improving the quality of the teaching-learning processes, contents and outputs in primary education. The pre-service teacher education will improve areas such as knowledge of subject matter, pedagogical skills, curricula knowledge, and leadership, to be complemented by the in-service training to upgrade linguistic skills of teachers, to introduce competency-based curricula, and provide continuous professional development to teachers. The training programs will be consolidated, through the distribution of textbooks, management capacity building for early childhood development, and community, and private participation initiatives; 2) increasing universal access to primary, and secondary education by 2005, by improving the planning capacity of education inputs, at the central and regional levels. Private sector involvement, functional literacy, and girls, and non-formal education will be promoted; 3) improving the efficiency of the educational system, by making technical, and professional training more responsive to market demands. Human, and physical capacities of the technical, and professional training centers will be upgraded, viewing at improving higher education, and science and technology research; and, 4) enhancing pedagogic management capacity, through an overall monitoring structure, and improved management of human resources in the education sector."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania!$!MR","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":32},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":19},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"49,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MR","sectorcode":"EZ,BC,EV,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"61,78,65,59,63","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,7,8,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":32},{"Name":"Education","Percent":30},{"Name":"Education","Percent":19},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13},{"Name":"Education","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000021321_2010042211094240","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010042211094240","DocDate":"02-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022416202504","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022416202504","DocDate":"31-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01101004022460","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01101004022460","DocDate":"26-SEP-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01050405192591","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01050405192591","DocDate":"23-APR-2001"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
