Also strengthened, will be the school management committees, to allow them a greater role in school management. To enhance access to secondary schooling, MOE has been proves subsidies to girls at the secondary level, and, over the next few years, means-testing mechanisms will be piloted to better target these subsidies to the poor. Incentives will be provided to the private sector to set up institutions in underserved areas. Moreover, significant emphasis will be placed on program evaluation and monitoring to guide policymaking, namely information on standardized examination outcomes, school performance, and on program effectiveness. An autonomous Teacher registration and certification agency will be established, responsible for developing a roster of pre-qualified, and certified teachers. An apex institution will also be established to manage teacher training, and regulate training institutions, and, set standards for new, and in-service teachers.
