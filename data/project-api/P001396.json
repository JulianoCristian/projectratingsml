It includes the following facilities to permit water transfer and install 72 MW capacity of hydropower: (i) a 182 meter-high concrete arch dam at Katse; (ii) 48 kms of tunnels to transfer the stored water from Katse to 'Muela; (iii) a 72 MW hydro power plant (with 120 km of transmission lines to Maseru) and a 55 meter-high concrete gravity arch dam at 'Muela; (iv) a 16 km delivery tunnel from 'Muela to the crossover point into RSA; and (v) 200 kms of access roads, including two bridges and other infrastructure facilities.  The project also includes environmental protection measures, compensation and resettlement, construction supervision, technical assistance, road maintenance, improved border crossing facilities and studies to prepare the next phase (1B) of the scheme.  An important element of the project is the creation of a development fund for channelling project revenues (royalties and other project related payments) to development-oriented programs."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Lesotho!$!LS","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":56},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Power","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":11},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":23},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"110,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LS","sectorcode":"JB,BC,LD,TA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,82,45,62,85","mjthemecode":"11,7,5,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":56},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":17},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000356161_20101108022532","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101108022532","DocDate":"01-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00012805311486","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00012805311486","DocDate":"13-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185413","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185413","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930235148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930235148","DocDate":"02-JUL-1991"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Lesotho"}},"facets":{}}
