There are four major components. The first strengthens the regulation, supervision, and operations of deposit-taking institutions by financing consultant contracts; providing specialized training of bank examiners; supporting the purchase of laptop computers, software, and other equipment; and supporting the upgrade of a national bank. The second component restructures and privatizes the Uganda Commercial Bank Limited by funding a management contract and other services as well as funding severance payments for redundant staff. The third component improves monetary management and payment systems. The fourth component develops insurance and contractual savings reforms and regulations by supporting the drafting of legislation, financing equipment and training, developing pension systems, and assisting capital markets development. Other components include finance project implementation and an as-needed reserve fund."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"sector5":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"13,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General finance sector"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"FZ,BC,FD,JB,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"42,44,30,40,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,2,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","code":"FD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":60},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":21},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000090341_20041216084612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041216084612","DocDate":"18-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031215315818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031215315818","DocDate":"06-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9905260827176","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9905260827176","DocDate":"07-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101158","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101158","DocDate":"02-APR-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
