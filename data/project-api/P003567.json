The project will assist China's efforts to strengthen lower middle school teaching nationwide by providing for development of teaching services in 15 provinces and autonomous regions, focusing on 124 teacher training institutions and on provincial and county education bureaus.  It will thereby focus on a critical segment of the education system, lower middle school teaching services, and will consist of three major elements:  institution, management and quality enhancement.  The institutional element will address operational needs at the teacher training institutions through facilities upgrading, provision of instructional equipment, spares and consumables, library development, and staff upgrading. The management element will develop general teaching system management capabilities at the central, provincial and institutional levels through staff training and specialist services.  The quality enhancement element will include teaching methodology core seminars, pilot programs and innovation programs."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
