There are three project components. The first strengthens decentralized planning and implementation capacity by providing training for government and project staff as well as community facilitators; and supporting information campaigns to ensure widespread public understanding, transparency and accountability, including distribution of printed materials, signboards, newsletters, and broadcasts by mass media. The second component provides grants to communes for infrastructure development within communes and infrastructure works that impact two or more communes. The third component finances the operating expenses of a central project management unit."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":23},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":23},"sector4":{"Name":"Power","Percent":23},"sector5":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"102,780,000","sector":[{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Social Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"BZ,LD,AI,WZ,TZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,51,26,78","mjthemecode":"10,2,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":23},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":23},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":23},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":23},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20100303011829","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100303011829","DocDate":"01-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201230298","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201230298","DocURL":"06-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201225896","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201225896","DocURL":"06-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060904004321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060904004321","DocDate":"04-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00072905363922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00072905363922","DocDate":"30-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Social Assessment (SOA),  Vol.1","DocType":"SOA","EntityID":"000094946_00082605593360","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082605593360","DocDate":"31-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00012505454863","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00012505454863","DocDate":"28-JAN-2000"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}},"facets":{}}
