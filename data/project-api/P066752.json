This project is the first phase of a four-year project. There are four project components. Component 1 aims to consolidate the role of the Directorate of Biodiversity and Protected Areas (DBPA) as the agency responsible for administering the National System of Protected Areas (NSPA). It will develop the regulatory framework to promote participatory management and co-management of PAs in the country.Sub-components include: 1) updating the NSPA strategic plan to coordinate DBAP long-term actions; 2) preparing a financial and managerial system for DBAP and implementing it in nine protected areas; 3) developing a sustainable financial strategy; 4) implementing pilot concessions of services; 5) designing and implementing a training program; 6) strengthening mechanisms for institutional coordination, participation, technical advice, and political support by civil society to manage and consolidate the NSPA; and 7) developing legal instruments. Component 2 promotes participatory management by developing participatory models according to the specific social and political conditions of each area. Component 3 is directed to achieve the consolidation of the Protected Areas Fund (FAP) that operates within the National Environmental Fund of Ecuador. Component 4 establishes a follow-up system to evaluate and monitor implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
