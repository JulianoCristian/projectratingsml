The project will:  (i) increase institutional credit penetration in rainfed areas to help increase agricultural production and to assist Morocco towards reaching self sufficiency in food stuffs, and (ii) augment non budgetary financing of agriculture through increased credit extension to small farmers.  This is aimed at increasing production and farmers' income.  In addition, it will (iii) upgrade the technology being used by small farmers in rainfed areas and increase land productivity by financing more intensive use of chemical fertilizers, high yielding seeds and small scale mechanization; (iv) generate value added by financing individual and cooperative on-farm storage, small- and medium-size agroindustry, as well as construction and equipment of greenhouses.  Lastly, the project will provide for (v) institutional development already started during CNCA V by:  strengthening Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) management structure; improving its lending appraisal procedures; completing the installation of its management information system and increasing domestic resources mobilization activity."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925181053","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925181053","DocDate":"30-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000334955_20090122062125","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090122062125","DocDate":"30-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092815","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092815","DocDate":"30-JUN-1986"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
