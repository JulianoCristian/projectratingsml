The five year project will include the following components: a) improved water resources planning and management - preparation of a national water resources plan, improvement of national data collection networks, establishment of a national water information network and strengthening of the National Water Resources Board (NWRB); b) improved watershed management - formulation of a national watershed management strategy and investment and institutional strengthening program, investments for improved management; and staff training/study watershed management tour; c) improvement and repair of National Irrigation System (NIS) - system improvement, repairs in major structures, strengthening of Masiway dam, and construction of sediment inclusion structures; d) institutional strengthening of NIA and Irrigators Associations (IAs) - staff training, consultancies, computers and incremental operating costs to facilitate progressive management; and e) environmental improvement - control of schistosomiasis, erosion control works; sediment monitoring, and establishment of an Environmental Unit within NIA and provision of training and consultancy to the unit."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":81},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":19},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"58,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"BC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,82","mjthemecode":"11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":81},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060717093524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060717093524","DocDate":"18-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182247","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182247","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123124688","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123124688","DocURL":"20-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970128121235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970128121235","DocDate":"10-OCT-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
