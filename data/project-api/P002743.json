The venture will develop renewable energy resources, new job opportunities as well as supplying power to isolated areas. In addition, it will replace production from diesel sets, thus providing substantial foreign exchange savings as well as laying the basis for improved power sector coordination, tariff policy, power system control and load dispatching practices. A further objective of the project is to maintain and further improve Tanesco's operations through support of its training and management programs. Specifically, the project components include: (a) construction of a water intake; a headrace tunnel as well as a vertical penstock system leading to an underground powerhouse; a tailrace tunnel; a switchyard; and ancillary buildings. The project will also include: (b) construction of a system control center at Dar es Salaam; (c) rehabilitation of the existing Ubongo diesel station and other power system facilities. Funds are also intended for: (d) training and management programmes; and finally for (e) consultancy services."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05db3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05db3_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUL-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05db1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05db1_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUL-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101252","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101252","DocDate":"30-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912594141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912594141","DocDate":"30-JUN-1983"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
