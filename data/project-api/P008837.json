The project focuses on core institution building activities that include the financing of equipment and technical assistance. Its four components are: 1) the standards enquiry point; 2) standards harmonization; 3) certification and accreditation; and 4) a project preparation and implementation unit (PPIU)."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other trade and integration","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"24,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"50,49","mjthemecode":"5,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Other trade and integration","code":"50"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200220106","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200220106","DocURL":"07-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200220307","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200220307","DocDate":"07-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200220106","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200220106","DocDate":"07-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200220307","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200220307","DocURL":"07-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb89_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb89_1_0","DocDate":"30-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961008070940","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008070940","DocDate":"08-NOV-1995"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
