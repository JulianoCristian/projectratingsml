This would put the economy on a sustainable path of lower energy intensity, and greenhouse gas emissions. The investment financing component will support the establishment, and operation of an Energy Efficiency Development and Financing Facility, which will be operated under the Free Fund, set as an independent, autonomous legal entity, in a public-private partnership, with GEF funds used to capitalize the Fund, and partially defray initial transaction costs. The project is designed to attract substantial amount of commercial co-financing, and will allow for both parallel, and direct co-financing arrangements. Initially, the Fund will focus primarily on financing projects within restructured, and/or privatized industries, based on established creditworthiness, and on minimal risk, and maximum potential criteria. Other types of financing will include equipment leasing, payment for services, and financial products which the evolving market demands. The technical assistance (TA) component will cover three broad areas: 1) capacity building activities on initial project development, workshops and seminars for partners, and training Fund Managers in energy efficiency financing; 2) Fund management activities, which includes retainer fees of the Fund Manager for the first three year; and, 3) FREE administration activities, to include its set-up and running costs during the first four years. Donor support for TA will likely come in the form of tied, or in-kind contributions for capacity building activities."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"FZ,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,48,81,84","mjthemecode":"11,11,5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":90},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20090602025656","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20090602025656","DocDate":"24-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050514364967","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050514364967","DocDate":"18-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052714453166","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052714453166","DocDate":"18-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02090504020958","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02090504020958","DocDate":"27-AUG-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02041804062647","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02041804062647","DocDate":"11-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02021404025866","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02021404025866","DocDate":"11-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00110105340715","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00110105340715","DocDate":"27-OCT-2000"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
