EMCAP is part of a broader, ambitious effort by the Government to improve economic governance and the tools for economic management. The project supports and strengthens capacity building efforts and assists in good governance and the anti-corruption stance of the government. The project has eight components. The first improves economic statistics and national accounts, consumer price data, poverty monitoring indicators, social statistics, and primary data collection. The second component strengthens the capacity of the national planning commission to prioritize, allocate, and monitor public expenditures. The third component supports oversight institutions to promote transparency and accountability in the public sector, and to improve dissemination of information on fiscal operations. The fourth component finances a comprehensive review of the public sector covering financial, operational, technical, legal, and contractual aspects as well as reform of key sector institutions. The remaining four components strengthen procurement activities in the public sector, policy development capabilities, and the legal and judicial systems along with supporting the design and implementation of an information management system."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":89},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"BG,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Rule of law","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"29,32,22,27","mjthemecode":"2,1,3,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","code":"22"},{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":89},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080808010643","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080808010643","DocDate":"26-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201122665","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201122665","DocURL":"22-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201122665","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201122665","DocDate":"22-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00042605303069","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00042605303069","DocDate":"25-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99122006272862","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99122006272862","DocDate":"30-JUN-1999"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
