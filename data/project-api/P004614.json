The project comprises two major components. The first is a credit component for medium and long term loans to finance private investments in agricultural and other viable rural operations for a broad spectrum of agricultural and non-farm rural investment, processing, marketing, transport services, storage facilities, custom service of leasing operations and import of ciritical inputs. The second is an institutional strengthening program which will strengthen LBP financially and organizationally to ensure its sustainability in providing financial services to the rural population."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General finance sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"FZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"75,44","mjthemecode":"4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00030305380889","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00030305380889","DocDate":"04-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010041410434705","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010041410434705","DocDate":"10-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123090653","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123090653","DocURL":"10-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123090552","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123090552","DocURL":"10-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e7c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e7c_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e7b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e7b_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e7a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e7a_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e79_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e79_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacf06_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacf06_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081eacf05_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacf05_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019095500","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019095500","DocDate":"16-AUG-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
