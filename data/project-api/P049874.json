The project consists of three components: 1) The technical learning in firms component will focus on building the technical capabilities of majority Mozambican-owned firms in manufacturing and exports. The component will support the establishments of the Firm Competitiveness Office, Training and Advisory Office, and Linkage Program Office. All three foster technical learning through the private marketplace. 2) Under the finance component, two financial products will be available for firms in all sectors -- a special facility designed to provide small, first-time bank borrowers with loans amounting to a maximum of $15,000; and a traditional facility to finance loans up to $300,000 for small and medium-scale borrowers. 3) The institutional capacity building component will enhance the capabilities of private and public institutions to deliver business support services; and support Government agencies in their transformation process from maintaining control functions to providing business facilitation and promotion services, including improving their capability to identify and ease bureaucratic rigidities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"26,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"BC,YZ,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"41,45,44","mjthemecode":"4,5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":43},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":29},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000442464_20140313103925","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20140313103925","DocDate":"05-MAR-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20070208114649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20070208114649","DocDate":"29-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201110406","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201110406","DocURL":"01-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201110708","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201110708","DocURL":"01-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00011205321481","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00011205321481","DocDate":"29-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99052707185031","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99052707185031","DocDate":"31-MAR-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique"}},"facets":{}}
