Considering the complexity of the reconstruction efforts and taking into account the Bank's country and international experience in earthquake projects, the project will be implemented over a four-year period. The funding of the reconstruction program relies primarily on Government financing as well as support from the World Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, the Islamic Development Bank and countries from the Persian Gulf and Europe. There are five project components (some with multiple subcomponents): 1) provision of construction material and equipment for housing and commercial buildings; 2) repair of the transport infrastructure; 3) repair of the telecommunications infrastructure; 4) improved emergency preparedness in the province of Kerman and the district of Bam; and 5) project management and technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Iran!$!IR","sector1":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":82},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Aviation","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"220,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Housing construction"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Aviation"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Technical Annex,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"IR","sectorcode":"TV,CT,TA,YC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Urban development","Rural development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,78,71,52","mjthemecode":"6,9,10,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Aviation","code":"TV"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":82},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":6},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20100928235953","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20100928235953","DocDate":"26-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010031609384568","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031609384568","DocDate":"16-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010031609384568","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031609384568","DocURL":"16-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000160016_20041012100319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20041012100319","DocDate":"05-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000012009_20041220083426","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041220083426","DocDate":"01-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20040816091807","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040816091807","DocDate":"09-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20040818140202","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040818140202","DocDate":"09-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20040514093642","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040514093642","DocDate":"11-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20040419091811","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040419091811","DocDate":"15-APR-2004"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Iran"}},"facets":{}}
