The Government's strategy in this period of transition (1986-1996) before Portugal's full accession to the EEC, is to transform agriculture into an efficient and export oriented sector.  The project will assist this strategy in the Tras-Os-Montes region through: (i) strengthening of basic agricultural services (research, extension, and planning); (ii) provision of long term credit for modernization of agroindustries, and replanting of 5,000 ha of existing vineyards for port wine; (iii) rehabilitation of 220 small traditional irrigation schemes, and construction of 18 new medium size irrigation schemes; and (iv) construction and rehabilitation of rural infrastructure including roads, water supply and sewerage, electrification and development of national and natural parks."},"country_namecode":"Portuguese Republic!$!PT","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":17},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":9},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":38},"sector4":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":18},"sector5":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":18},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Renewable energy"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PT","sectorcode":"LE,TA,YZ,BZ,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,51,39,75","mjthemecode":"10,4,6,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":38},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":18},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":18}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041411361653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041411361653","DocDate":"30-AUG-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050514340754","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050514340754","DocDate":"30-AUG-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927085601","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927085601","DocDate":"20-MAR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927085420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927085420","DocDate":"16-MAR-1989"}],"countryname":"Portuguese Republic"}},"facets":{}}
