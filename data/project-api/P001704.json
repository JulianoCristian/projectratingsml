It would consist of: (a) a US$3.5 million line of credit and a comprehensive technical assistance and institution building program for the Malian private industrial and traditional sector, and (b) the rehabilitation and expansion of Union Laitiere de Bamako (ULB). There are no significant project risks, although hesitation on the part of modern institutions to assist the traditional artisan community could affect project performance. However, assistance to artisans has been designed to minimize the possibility that available assistance might not reach that community."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190234248","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190234248","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd1ed_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd1ed_1_0","DocDate":"26-FEB-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd1eb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd1eb_1_0","DocDate":"26-FEB-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
