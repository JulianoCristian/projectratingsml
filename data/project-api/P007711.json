First, productive investments will finance demand-driven investment sub-projects for agricultural production, natural resources management, processing activities, and productive infrastructure. Second, community development will include preparation of community-based natural resources management plans and small works associated with them; small projects related to community activities; and training and workshops to facilitate beneficiary participation in the project. Third, technical support covers the provision of extension services, technical assistance, training for farmers, producers organizations, women's groups, and small entrepreneurs.
