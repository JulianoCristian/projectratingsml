This will be carried out by improving the immunization services and by introducing policy measures to improve vaccine quality and to ensure access of all population groups, and to add new vaccines to the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI); and 2) improve the capacity of the health sector to design and implement health promotion programs to prevent and control the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and injury. This will be accomplished through policy and institutional improvements and by implementing pilot programs, including surveillance, staff training, health education and other health promotion interventions, at selected locations. The project comprises three main components: 1) immunization, which consists of four sub-components: (a) cold chain improvement; (b) health workers' training; (c) management and surveillance; and (d) information, education and communication; 2) health promotion, which will comprise the following sub-components: (a) institutional development and policy reform; (b) human resources development; (c) surveillance, especially behavioral risk factor surveillance; and (d) community-based interventions; and 3) the national-level programs.
