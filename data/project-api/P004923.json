The project comprises a program to develop improved national research and development systems. The research sub-project components are: (a) to strengthen the National Institute for Agricultural Research; (b) to implement priority research themes; (c) application of programming by objectives to research implementation; (d) to upgrade five experimental farms to regional research centers; (e) staff training and technical assistance. The extension sub-project would test approaches for developing a national extension service.  The components are: (a) introduction of improved extension organization and methods; (b) provision of improved research - extension - farmer linkage; (c) to strengthen five extension training centers; (d) to reinforce the National Center for Agricultural Training (CNPA); (e) to establish monitoring and evaluation units at CNPA; and (f) training, technical assistance and fellowships."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,83,78","mjthemecode":"10,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042809115262","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042809115262","DocDate":"03-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032912084063","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032912084063","DocDate":"26-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929072409","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929072409","DocDate":"11-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929072213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929072213","DocDate":"11-MAY-1990"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
