The project consists of six components: 1) The first component will finance international consultants to establish a new legal and regulatory framework and enact secondary legislation which will cover organization and functioning of regulatory authority, competition, licensing, interconnection, etc. 2) The second component will implement gradual liberalization of policy in the sector by financing a detailed transaction strategy for the award of the Global System for Mobil Communication (GSM) licenses. 3) The third component will help restructure the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT). A consultancy will assist the Government with the separation of the telecommunications and postal operations from the MPT. 4) The fourth component will finance a detailed transaction and marketing strategy for the privatization of the Telecommunications entity. 5) The fifth component will elaborate a comprehensive postal development strategy focusing on long term competitiveness and modernization of the postal work. 6) The last component will strengthen communication strategy and capacity building by informing potential investors on new business opportunities and ensure transparency of the reform program.
