A further objective is to assist the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) in developing permanent institutions for improved water sector planning, preserving the institutional capacity developed under the Flood Action Plan (FAP) and making multi-disciplinary planning part of Bangladesh's normal water sector planning processes. The project's components are: 1) rehabilitation and construction of river-bank protection works at two sites on the Brahmaputra River's west bank; 2) land acquisition and a program of resettlement for people displaced by project works; 3) technical assistance for implementation supervision and maintenance of works constructed under the project; 4) establishment and initial funding of a specialized operations and maintenance (O&M) Unit in the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) to maintain the riverbank protection works constructed under the project, and procurement of vehicles and equipment for the O&M Unit; 5) institution building technical assistance to Water Resources Planning Organization (WARPO) to integrate the FAP within the framework of national water planning, produce a national water management plan and a portfolio of investment projects for the medium and long-term, and upgrade integrated water sector planning capability; and 6) institutional capacity building technical assistance to BWDB to improve the operation of the new regional accounting centers, and pr"},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":93},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"121,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Flood protection"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"JB,BC,WD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"62,25,52,85","mjthemecode":"11,6,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":93},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02070404010188","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02070404010188","DocDate":"20-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123380753","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123380753","DocURL":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123380854","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123380854","DocDate":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123380753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123380753","DocDate":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123380854","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123380854","DocURL":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23f5a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23f5a_1_0","DocDate":"05-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008072714","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008072714","DocDate":"10-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135105","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135105","DocDate":"31-JUL-1992"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
