To achieve these objectives, the project will: (i) improve an equitable and reliable water supply in the command area; and (ii) improve water distribution among farmers below the 10 ha block outlets and promote better water management on the farm. This will require a number of complementary activities, including strengthening of the project organization for operation and maintenance, on-farm development, introduction of rotational water supply below the block outlet, establishment of farmer organizations, and training of project staff and farmers in new management practices. As this is an integral part of a continuing project the risks are considered less than average for irrigation projects of similar size and scope. Cost estimates are firm as they are based on the experience of the on-going project. Projections of yields are conservative and are well within the reach of the average farmer's capability."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008032535","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008032535","DocDate":"04-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05bfe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05bfe_1_0","DocDate":"01-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05bfc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05bfc_1_0","DocDate":"01-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05bfb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05bfb_1_0","DocDate":"01-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902441170","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902441170","DocDate":"30-APR-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
