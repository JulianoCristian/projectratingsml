The sub-projects will include such social sector projects as the rehabilitation and construction of schools, health stations and clinics, water supply sources, and sanitation equipment. The sub-projects will be beneficial to the environmental conservation in areas affected by soil erosion and deforestation. The sub-projects will also provide communities with techniques for identifying development priorities, managing project implementation, and maintaining assets. The ECDF will not implement projects, but will support and facilitate the efforts of local communities and will ensure the provision of technical expertise in project implementation and management wherever the community needs. The implementation of the rehabilitation works will be carried out in a decentralized, pragmatic, and flexible way, and will give a large responsibility to the community for preparation and supervision."},"country_namecode":"State of Eritrea!$!ER","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"17,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ER","sectorcode":"EZ,JA,WC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,26,54,73","mjthemecode":"9,6,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":25},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25},{"Name":"Education","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02060704012040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02060704012040","DocDate":"06-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123390592","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123390592","DocURL":"26-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123390693","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123390693","DocDate":"26-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123390592","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123390592","DocDate":"26-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23c3e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23c3e_1_0","DocDate":"29-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019145904","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019145904","DocDate":"30-JAN-1996"}],"countryname":"State of Eritrea"}},"facets":{}}
