The project will finance household rehabilitation in Tigray; mine clearing; and, road rehabilitation and improvement. In addition, reallocations from existing International Development Association (IDA) credits, will finance other elements of the program, including household rehabilitation in Afar, community infrastructure rehabilitation, HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support, and, rehabilitation/improvement of power supply infrastructure. The main expected benefit of the program will be to mitigate the consequences of the ongoing humanitarian crisis, by providing assistance to the war-affected people in rebuilding their lives, and resume productive economic activities, as well as to lay the basis for long-term recovery, through infrastructure rehabilitation. Nonetheless, the resumption of hostilities is the major external risk, while project specific risks are linked to weak implementation capacity. The credit will be disbursed by December 31, 2003, and, retroactive financing - up to a certain amount - has been approved for expenditures made after June 18, 2000."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":61},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Power","Percent":18},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"230,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Technical Annex","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"BC,LD,TA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Economic management","Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"58,71,23,78","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,1,9,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":61},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":19},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":18},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070820101633","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070820101633","DocDate":"21-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20041215111448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20041215111448","DocDate":"01-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20030605164011","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20030605164011","DocDate":"05-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03062004020021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03062004020021","DocDate":"31-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201171363","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201171363","DocDate":"21-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201171363","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201171363","DocURL":"21-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201171162","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201171162","DocURL":"21-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201171162","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201171162","DocDate":"21-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00121906040759","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121906040759","DocDate":"09-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_00113005454393","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00113005454393","DocDate":"09-NOV-2000"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
