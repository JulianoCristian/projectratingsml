The project components are: 1) construction of the Yinxing pumped storage power plant, a new upper reservoir, new main dam and subsidiary dam, and the underground powerhouse; 2) assistance to the restructuring of the power sector; and 3) construction of a double circuit transmission line to connect the Yixing pumped storage plant to the East China 500 KV network. The project will contribute to the Bank's energy sector strategy for China by assisting in making a smooth transition from a fully state-owned monopolistic sector to a diversely owned, market-oriented sector in which are promoted clean fuels, renewable energy, energy efficiency and assistance to poor western areas to develop their energy resources for local growth and export to other regions."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u5b9c\u5174\u62bd\u6c34\u84c4\u80fd\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u8be5\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5728\u5b9c\u5174\u5efa\u8bbe\u4e00\u5ea7\u62bd\u6c34\u84c4\u80fd\u7535\u7ad9\uff084x25\u4e07\u5343\u74e6\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8c03\u5cf0\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u53d1\u7535\u7ec4\u5408\u7535\u6e90\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u7f51\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u53d1\u7535\u4fa7\u7ade\u4ef7\u4e0a\u7f51\u63d0\u4f9b\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8c03\u914d\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4f9b\u7535\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u521b\u9020\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5e02\u573a\u826f\u597d\u8fd0\u8f6c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8981\u6c42\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"145,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Resettlement Plan,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"BH,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,39","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052110301333","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052110301333","DocDate":"05-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02102904033416","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02102904033416","DocDate":"28-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03030704020586","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03030704020586","DocDate":"21-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01080304112170","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01080304112170","DocDate":"02-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02101805022494","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02101805022494","DocDate":"31-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02080604013529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02080604013529","DocDate":"30-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_02100904013346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02100904013346","DocDate":"31-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02100904013344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02100904013344","DocDate":"31-JAN-2002"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
