There are two main project components beside the project management component. The first component finances technical assistance and training activities to build the capacity of local stakeholders, primarily communes and their constituents (including likely project beneficiaries), but also private service providers, county council technical staff, and other stakeholders. The second component provides funding for demand-driven investments prepared for communes and community-based organizations. The component will also finance a public environmental health promotion campaign, and a rural water/sanitation strategy study. In connection with roads, the component will fund studies aimed at improving the broader legal, institutional, and regulatory framework for rural transport and roads."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":23},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"JB,BH,TA,WA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,75,76,57","mjthemecode":"7,10,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":25},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":25},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":23},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080805022152","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080805022152","DocDate":"25-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201500863","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201500863","DocURL":"03-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201500662","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201500662","DocDate":"03-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201500863","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201500863","DocDate":"03-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00071906411173","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00071906411173","DocDate":"19-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02030604010440","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02030604010440","DocDate":"22-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0112210401383","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0112210401383","DocDate":"21-FEB-2002"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
