The basic objectives of the Third Highway Sector Loan Project are to assist the Government in sustaining an efficient road transport system and to continue to support the goals of its Sixth Development Plan including : a) protection of past investments in the highway sector by concentrating on rehabilitation and maintenance; b) reduction of road transport costs and improvements in the transport services which will, among other things, facilitate transfer of industrial and other economic activity away from Bangkok to smaller cities and rural areas; c) improvements in road traffic safety; and d) improvement in environmental control of vehicular air and noise pollution.  The loan also provides supplementary finance to the Department of Highways (DOH) 1987-91 program.  The bulk of the loan will continue financing components of DOH's road development program.  Specific subprojects to be financed under the loan will be selected on the basis of agreed upon criteria and procedures."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":74},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":26},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,39","mjthemecode":"4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":74},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":26}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019122554","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019122554","DocDate":"26-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928162630","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928162630","DocDate":"03-APR-1990"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
