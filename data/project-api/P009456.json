To this end, the project will include:  (i) a Refinery Modification Component to enhance the flexibility of the Eastern Refinery Limited facility at Chittagong by bringing about a better match between refinery output and domestic demand for petroleum products.  The project will also include (ii) a first phase LPG Recovery, Storage and Distribution Component designed to establish the institutional framework and facilities to promote the consumption of about 11,000 mTpa of LPG with a view to developing the capability for eventually marketing up to 120,000 mTpa expected to be recovered from natural gas fields in the future."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"47,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"GS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","code":"GS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961219131918","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219131918","DocDate":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36bea_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36bea_1_0","DocDate":"16-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36be8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36be8_1_0","DocDate":"16-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091604","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091604","DocDate":"30-NOV-1986"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
