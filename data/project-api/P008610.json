The project consists of seven components grouped into four categories.  The first category, environmental forest management, includes activities to increase the vitality of forest stands and their ability to overcome the effects of present and future levels of air pollution and other stress factors.  Funds will be provided for:  labor-intensive activities such as tending and thinning; restoration of air pollution damaged forests to protect delicate watersheds and prevent soil erosion; afforestation of land moving out of agriculture; and a genetic conservation and improvement program to ensure the availability of high quality seed.  The second category, modernization of harvesting, skidding and transport equipment, will reduce the negative environmental impact of current practices.  The General Directorate of State Forests (GDSF) will develop a privatization plan for harvesting, skidding, and transportation operations by June 30, 1994. The third category, ecosystem conservation in national parks, includes funding for the core component of a program to conserve Poland's ecosystems located in the national park system.  Management activities within all national parks will follow the plans of national park protection developed as a result of the project.  Finally, the fourth category, institutional development, includes technical support, equipment, and related investments to the GDSF and the Board of Polish National Parks to assist the organizational, management, and financial restructuring of the GDSF.  Funding will also be provided "},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":72},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"theme1":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"146,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"BC,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"86,82,43,84,80","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11,4,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":72},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200114404","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200114404","DocURL":"31-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200114404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200114404","DocDate":"31-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003180255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003180255","DocDate":"06-JUL-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
