The specific objectives are to: (a) improve water supply conditions; (b) improve traffic and public transport conditions; and (c) improve measures for water pollution abatement. The water supply component will develop physical works, including transmission and distribution pipelines, water intake works, pumping stations, and water treatment works.  It includes a study of water resource and water supply pricing.  A water pollution control component will provide technical assistance for a study of industrial wastewater treatment and environmental regulations.  In addition, equipment will be acquired for environmental monitoring.  The urban transport component, will improve about 44 km of arterial road corridors, and provide equipment, technical assistance and training to support management of public transport operations, in particular, road and public vehicle maintenance, road safety measures, and operations management.  Technical assistance will be included in the project to assist in planning and design of a second phase of the investment program, focusing on water pollution abatement."},"country_namecode":"People's
