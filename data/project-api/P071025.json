The first Adaptable Program Lending (APL) would cover the nine poorest provinces of the NOA and NEA. By the end of loan implementation of APLl (5th project year), 80% of the targeted population would be covered and served by the Maternal and Child Health Insurance Program (MCHIP) (more than 600,000 beneficiaries). The project has the following five components: Component 1) will include finance to: (i) capitation payments for MCHIP services by National Ministry of Health (MSN) to participating provinces; (ii) equipment (medical, transportation and communications) for basic health care facilities that supply the MCHIP package; (iii) technical assistance and training programs to MSPs for developing systems, instruments and skills necessary for implementing and running the MCHIP (iv) training for health care providers in delivering the MCHIP CPB; and (V) equipment and consultant services for upgrading and expanding information systems for monitoring the implementation of the MCHIP. Component 2) will adapt the provincial and national ministries of health to the demands of the MCHIP (information, managerial), including the start-up of the national and provincial purchasing units, which will act, respectively, as the national Project Implementation Unit (PMU) and Provincial Project Implementation Units (PPMU). Component 3) will ensure the effectiveness of the MCHIP, the Government needs to ensure that the target populations, particularly those who have historically been marginalized,
