The project would provide assistance to about 700 primary schools in six of Nepal's 75 districts through the provision of effective in-service teacher training systems with follow-up supervision, better school management and community support, better teaching materials, and improved physical facilities. Communication problems and economic constraints would be addressed in part through the clustering of schools around a resource center which would assume some of the educational responsibilities for teacher training and supervision. Technical assistance would be extended to the Curriulum,Textbook, and Supervision Development Center and other agencies of Ministry of Education and Culture responsible for project planning and implementing the Government's educational policies. A reform of the examination system for the School Leaving Certificate would be undertaken."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"NP","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902440765","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902440765","DocDate":"30-APR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05be7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05be7_1_0","DocDate":"24-APR-1984"}],"countryname":"Nepal"}},"facets":{}}
