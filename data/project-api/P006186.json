The project will include the following components: 1) studies to support the development of the regulatory framework, which will include basic data collection and policy development implementation; 2) laboratory upgrading for the implementation of a program to foster development of credible laboratory testing services in Bolivia; 3) remediation investments, which will be done on a pilot basis and only for those eligible subprojects comprising priority environmental management measures; and 4) technical assistance and training to support environmental management in mining."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"Mining and other extractive","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":43},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"11,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Mining and other extractive"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"BC,LB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,84","mjthemecode":"11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Mining and other extractive","code":"LB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":57},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":43}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009486_20050103113209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009486_20050103113209","DocDate":"29-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122060992","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122060992","DocURL":"28-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122061393","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122061393","DocDate":"28-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122060992","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122060992","DocDate":"28-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122061994","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122061994","DocDate":"28-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122061994","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122061994","DocURL":"28-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122061393","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122061393","DocURL":"28-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23c1e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23c1e_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029220135","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029220135","DocDate":"22-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145848","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145848","DocDate":"31-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.4","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145852","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145852","DocDate":"31-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145851","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145851","DocDate":"31-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145849","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145849","DocDate":"31-MAY-1995"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
