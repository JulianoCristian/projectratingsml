The station is expected to operate on high speed diesel oil; however, provision is being made for the use of alternate fuel (gas, furnace oil, crude oil) if and when this is available. The fuel will be supplied through an existing pipeline from Karachi to Gujrat, which will be extended to Kot Addu with a 30 km spur pipeline."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019214152","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019214152","DocDate":"29-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092555","DocDate":"31-MAY-1986"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
