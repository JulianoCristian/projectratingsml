The objective of this operation is to reduce public health risks and protect the environmental integrity of the island and their costal and marine systems, by improving domestic solid waste management facilities and facilitating compliance with the \"Special Area\" designation of the Caribbean Sea. The project will reduce terrestrial and marine pollution in this area through avoiding and discouraging indiscriminate disposal of solid waste both on and off shore. A further objective is to significantly enhance public health and environmental quality by strengthening the countries' capacities to effectively manage and dispose of solid waste in an environmentally sustainable manner. More specifically, project objectives are to assist the OECS governments to: (a) improve the coverage and effectiveness of domestic solid waste collection and disposal facilities; (b) reduce pollution of international and territorial waters caused by ship-generated solid waste; (c) improve the collection, treatment and disposal of ship-generated solid wastes; (d) assist the beneficiary countries in the establishment of appropriate legal and institutional frameworks to enable effective management and disposal of shore and ship-generated waste; (e) assist in the preparation of plans and programs to address the problems of collection, treatment and disposal of liquid waste; and (f) identify Regional opportunities for reduction, recovery and recycling of solid waste."},"country_namecode":"Organization of Eastern Caribbean States!$!6O","sector1":{"Name":"Solid waste management","Percent":87},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
