This project has two main components. The financial sector component provides onlending, through the central bank (CBSL), to the public banks and a few private banks for their eligible Y2K-related expenditures including the cost of consultants and equipment. It also finances technical assistance for CBSL to conduct its scaled up Y2K monitoring and supervision of banks. The government agencies component finances the cost of required equipment, experts (local and international) for various technical tasks, and short-term training for staff of the institutions mentioned. A project coordination unit will be set up to closely monitor concerned agencies and to assist the planning and implementation of their Y2K remediation activities."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":72},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"29,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"BC,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44","mjthemecode":"4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":72},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20030714174447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030714174447","DocDate":"13-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02012404004422","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02012404004422","DocDate":"20-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201031869","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201031869","DocURL":"22-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201031869","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201031869","DocDate":"22-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911070177","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911070177","DocDate":"12-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99030406252480","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99030406252480","DocDate":"28-DEC-1998"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
