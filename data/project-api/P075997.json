The project has the following six components: Component 1) will align and strengthen institutions to conserve the CFR. It will: (i) enhance interagency cooperation and strategic planning for conservation management, (ii) build capacity for effective conservation management, (iii) develop and appraise strategies for financial sustainability across the suite of Project Executing Agencies; and (iv) establish a shared and comprehensive information management system to share the most important knowledge requirements. Component 2) will support the development of a conservation education and awareness program to conserve the CFR. It will: (i) facilitate coordinated environmental education; and (ii) develop and disseminate materials focused on biodiversity, supportive of informal and formal education curricula, including training of educators to capitalize on the favorable education policy environment. Component 3) will strengthen the C.A.P.E. Coordination Unit at the NBI to undertake: (i) program coordination and management; (ii) financial management of the overall Project; (iii) program portfolio management and coordinated monitoring and evaluation to assess lessons learned, and support and develop a replication plan; and (iv) a communication program. Component 4) will expand the protected areas. It will: (i) plan and consolidate three large protected area complexes involving private landowners and inhabitants as beneficiaries; (ii) establish two freshwater, two estuarine and two clusters of marine protected areas; (iii) develop sustainable management effectiveness of protected areas through implementation of a Strategic Performance Management System, and (iv) develop "},"country_namecode":"Republic of South Africa!$!ZA","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Resettlement Plan,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,GEF Project Brief","countrycode":"ZA","sectorcode":"BH,AB,EZ,BC,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,80,76","mjthemecode":"10,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":60},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":21},{"Name":"Education","Percent":8},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20110728010831","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110728010831","DocDate":"25-APR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20040430105600","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040430105600","DocDate":"21-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_04010604002880","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_04010604002880","DocDate":"21-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20031210134756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20031210134756","DocDate":"04-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000012009_20031210103117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20031210103117","DocDate":"04-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20030619143256","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20030619143256","DocDate":"19-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"GEF Project Brief (GPB),  Vol.1","DocType":"GPB","EntityID":"000012009_20030602144847","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030602144847","DocDate":"02-JUN-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of South Africa"}},"facets":{}}
