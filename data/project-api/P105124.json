The overarching objective of the proposed loan/credit is to support the implementation of critical structural, fiscal, and administrative reforms needed to achieve sustainable and rapid economic growth and inclusive development over the medium term, while sustaining the environmental heritage of the state. The priority areas for the operation will be fiscal adjustment and promotion of environmentally sustainable development-with particular reference to the development of hydropower. The overall program will also support reforms to enhance growth and employment, and improve governance and public administration. The operation, consistent with CAS objectives, supports measures to institutionalize fiscal stabilization and to sustain rapid economic growth in one of India's major \"special category\" states. Fiscal reforms and measures to strengthen financial accountability should reduce the state's dependence on debt financing, while increasing fiscal space for development expenditures along with their efficiency."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Hydropower","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":11},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Hydropower"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document,Board Summary","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BZ,LH,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"25,82,81,21,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,1,11,11,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Hydropower","code":"LH"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20100721021025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100721021025","DocDate":"29-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2008022214262192","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2008022214262192","DocURL":"19-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2008022214262192","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2008022214262192","DocDate":"19-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2008022214275689","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2008022214275689","DocDate":"19-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2008022214275689","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2008022214275689","DocURL":"19-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000020953_20071002084431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20071002084431","DocDate":"23-AUG-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20070718090925","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20070718090925","DocDate":"11-JUL-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20070515115842","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20070515115842","DocDate":"04-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Summary (SU),  Vol.1","DocType":"SU","EntityID":"000020953_20070117115506","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070117115506","DocDate":"28-SEP-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of India","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
