There are three components in this project. First, supporting policy and institutional reform will define priority legal, institutional, and fiscal reforms to improve environmental management, define sectoral action plans for environmental management reform, and develop a NEMP. Second, developing pilot activities will develop innovative models for natural resource management, and increase decentralization of environmental functions. The third component, aiming at building capacity for project management and providing technical training, will strengthen capacity for environmental planning and management in key environmental agencies; ensure efficient and effective project implementation; and develop the needed human resources for the new institutional arrangements resulting from the reforms."},"country_namecode":"Dominican Republic!$!DO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":13},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"3,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"DO","sectorcode":"JB,BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rule of law","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"82,26,33,57,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,7,3,2,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":75},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030508100436","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030508100436","DocDate":"30-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200355682","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200355682","DocURL":"09-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980319100054","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980319100054","DocDate":"24-FEB-1998"}],"countryname":"Dominican Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
