To that end, the project includes municipal management and housing components.  The former component entails (i) the creation of a Municipal Credit Fund; (ii) equipment and training of the municipal technical department; (iii) ongoing technical assistance and complementary support to the Traffic Bureau; and (iv) improved collection of municipal taxes.  The latter comprises (i) financing of medium-term loans for the land development corporation; and (ii) financing of a long-term loan from the Government to the National Housing Bank (BHS) for housing construction financing.  The project is expected to boost the private supply of housing through a more efficient financing system.  Homeownership is a powerful motivation for household savings which are, in turn, the main source of domestic savings that can be invested in economic growth."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
