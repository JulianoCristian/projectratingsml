The project's global environment objective is to improve maritime safety and reduce environmental damage to the globally-significant shared natural resources o f the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. The project has five components: Component 1 provides project management by the International Maritime Organization on behalf of the participating countries, coordination of the design, and development and operation of the MEH demonstration system and also provides for key technical inputs to the project.  Component 2 supports the production o f the navigational information on which the MEH system will be based, and its incorporation into real-time electronic charts that ship operators will be able to use. Component 3 carries out testing of the demonstration MEH system by about 160 ships fitted with type-approved electronic chart display and information systems, including internet connectivity.  Component 4 will consist of oil spill and sand wave models; sensitive area mapping and emergency response systems. Component 5 will consist of website and publicity, evaluation of the MEH system, and system development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and
