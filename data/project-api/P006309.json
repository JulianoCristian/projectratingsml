It will also improve and guarantee safe water supply to 3.1 million people presently served. The water supply component of the project will include development of Serra Azul water source to increase water supply to the state capital, Belo Horizonte, by 2.6 m3/sec, construction of a dam to ensure continuous water supply from the Rio das Velhas source (also for Belo Horizonte) and expansion of the distribution system in the metropolitan Belo Horizonte area. In addition, it includes construction or expansion of water supply systems in about 30 medium-size cities and 150 small communities. The sewerage component includes expanding the metropolitan Belo Horizonte system, as well as construction or expansion of systems in about 12 medium-size cities. The project includes related studies and technical assistance required to carry out the project. It is estimated that about 40% of the final beneficiaries receiving water supply services in the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area will belong to families with incomes below the relative poverty level. Benefits in terms of control of waterborne diseases will accrue especially to the urban areas."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"139,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924210247","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924210247","DocDate":"23-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e961a4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961a4_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e961a3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961a3_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902352619","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902352619","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191248528","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191248528","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
