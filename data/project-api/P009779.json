The main subproject covers a three-year time slice, from fiscal year 1981 to 1983, of the P&T Telecommunications Branch's investment program. It involves expansion of the present telecommunications network through the provision of additional local telephone switching and direct exchange lines, long-distance public call offices and rural telephone exchanges, and trunk and telex facilities. The subproject also includes the provision of equipment and raw materials for P&T's telecommunications workshops; equipment for P&T's Telecommunications Research Center and its Technical and Development Circle; transmission equipment; and computing equipment for the four major metropolitan districts. The three remaining subprojects comprise the upgrading and modernization of the production facilities of the three major Government-owned telecommunications equipment manufacturers and the construction of a new factory for each. The upgrading and modernization activities involve the replacement of machinery in the production and tool-making units, and the addition of modern testing and measuring equipment to replace and supplement obsolete existing equipment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"314,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"CC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","code":"CC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e0456f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0456f_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0456d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0456d_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902365699","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902365699","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912514818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912514818","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
