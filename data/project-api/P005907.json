The project components include: 1) Water resources will help to increase urgently needed potable water through exploratory and production borehole drilling, rehabilitation of existing wellfields, and the provision of bulk meters. 2) Water supply and distribution will support leak detection, rehabilitation of tertiary networks and house connections characterized by high unaccounted for water, and network improvements. 3) Sewerage will finance emergency sewer network installations, including an urgently needed extension of the sewer trunk main. 4) Technical assistance and institution capacity building will support establishment of an autonomous Sana'a Branch, incremental operating expenditures, construction supervision, technical assistance and studies to support sector reform, and computer equipment. 5) Preparation of possible future Adaptable Program Loans will prepare tender documents for concession, management contract or \"affermage\", engineering design for follow-on
