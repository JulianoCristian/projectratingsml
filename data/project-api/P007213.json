The project will have two specific objectives. The first will be to improve the efficiency, accountability, and transparency of the financial management functions of the public sector through implementation of an Integrated Financial Management System (SIAF) centered in the Ministry of Finance and a modernized Government Auditing System (SAG) in the Comptroller General's Office. The second objective will be to improve the delivery of public services by supporting decentralization to line ministries of primary responsibility for management of their financial resources. The project comprises three major components: 1) reform of financial management policies and procedures supported by outside technical assistance; 2) investment in information systems involving the purchase and installation of computer hardware and software systems; and 3) a training component."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guatemala!$!GT","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"9,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"GT","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27","mjthemecode":"2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0002240712370","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0002240712370","DocDate":"02-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123080410","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123080410","DocURL":"22-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123080209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123080209","DocDate":"22-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123075907","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123075907","DocURL":"22-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123080108","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123080108","DocURL":"22-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123080209","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123080209","DocURL":"22-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123080410","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123080410","DocDate":"22-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123075907","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123075907","DocDate":"22-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123080108","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123080108","DocDate":"22-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3c62_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3c62_1_0","DocDate":"30-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961008030101","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008030101","DocDate":"05-MAY-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guatemala"}},"facets":{}}
