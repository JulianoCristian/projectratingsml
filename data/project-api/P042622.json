The project implementation is satisfactory, and the project objectives continue to be achievable. The project has provided key backing to laying the foundations of Russia's ambitious reform agenda (which includes as a key component the development of Moscow into an international financial center) by providing critical support to the institutional, legal and regulatory foundation underpinning the Russian capital markets throughout all of its stages of development - from infancy to high performing emerging market status. While all the other project activities will be completed by June 30, the extension is necessary mainly to finalize two ongoing core system assignments for the successful completion of the market infrastructure and capacity building of the Federal Financial Markets Service (FFMS) under the project. This will be CMDP's sixth and final extension. All ongoing activities will be completed in full by the new closing date while the loan proceeds will have been disbursed almost in full. A time-bound action plan for deliverables has been prepared to monitor the completion of these last contracts by the new closing date."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":76},"sector2":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"89,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Capital markets"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"BG,FK,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"34,39,40,42","mjthemecode":"4,4,4,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":76},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20110805005937","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110805005937","DocDate":"10-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010102512083635","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010102512083635","DocDate":"25-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000334955_20100709034553","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100709034553","DocDate":"29-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000334955_20100702010952","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100702010952","DocDate":"28-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333038_20091027234345","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20091027234345","DocDate":"01-JAN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20080220073552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080220073552","DocDate":"19-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200243306","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200243306","DocURL":"29-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200243105","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200243105","DocURL":"29-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961022115020","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022115020","DocDate":"06-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
