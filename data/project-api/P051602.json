The project will finance Albanian Guarantee Agency (AGA), which will issue guarantees to entities that finance productive activities in Albania. The project consists of three components. 1) Albania will contribute US$0.7 million as issued and paid-in capital for AGA. 2) Start-up costs (US$0.25 million) of the Albania Guarantee Agency will cover AGA's initial start-up costs for capital expenditures and administrative expenses in its first year. 3) Political Risks Guarantee Facility (US$20 million), managed by AGA, will mitigate the perceived risks that are preventing the private sector from having access to commercial financing for productive transactions or from risking their own funds to re-enter the market. As guarantees are issued, the funds will be placed in escrow with an agent bank outside Albania under liability until the guarantee runs off. The agent bank will also issue the beneficiary of the AGA an irrevocable standby letter of credit to ensure security."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"10,250,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AL","sectorcode":"FA,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44","mjthemecode":"4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":98},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009486_20040901121628","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009486_20040901121628","DocDate":"19-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02100404282197","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02100404282197","DocDate":"03-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200592737","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200592737","DocURL":"25-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200593039","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200593039","DocURL":"25-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200592636","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200592636","DocURL":"25-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200592035","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200592035","DocURL":"25-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200592737","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200592737","DocDate":"25-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200593039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200593039","DocDate":"25-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200592035","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200592035","DocDate":"25-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200592636","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200592636","DocDate":"25-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200592938","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200592938","DocDate":"25-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980219162602","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980219162602","DocDate":"05-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929094354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929094354","DocDate":"22-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Albania"}},"facets":{}}
