Scaling up Sustainable Land Management (SLM) Practice, Knowledge and Coordination Project will be a three-and-a-half-year incremental GEF grant to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, focused on mainstreaming SLM in Nigeria's agricultural sector. There are two components to the project. Component A: capacity building, communications and information support. This component will provide training and communications outreach on SLM planning and practice at local, state and federal levels, multi-sector coordination on land management investment at state and federal levels, training on local land use planning, as well as small community sub-project awards for existing communities that are successfully implementing SLM sub-projects under the baseline Third Fadama operation. Component B: monitoring, evaluation and knowledge. This component supports development of ecological and process monitoring tools, and also establishes a technical knowledge base on SLM, sustainable agriculture and related climate
