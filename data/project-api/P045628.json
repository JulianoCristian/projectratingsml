The disaster component was added after typhoon Linda with the objective to help normalize economic activity in the typhoon affected areas through the reconstruction of the electricity distribution network in such areas.  The project contains two distinct components.  The Transmission and Distribution Component will: construct transmission lines and substations; expand certain substations; rehabilitate distribution networks; and provide consulting services and demand side management.  The Disaster Reconstruction Component consists of reconstruction of low and medium voltage lines, as well as distribution transformer substations damaged by typhoon Linda."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector
