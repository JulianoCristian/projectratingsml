Also, it would serve as a training ground to prepare the skilled management and manpower needed to develop the aluminum industry in the Amazon region, which has enormous potential. Moreover, it would introduce to Brazil an advanced aluminum reduction technology. At full production, the project's output would reach 86,000 tons per year and substitute imports with an estimated yearly value of US$145 million. The main project components would be: a carbon plant to provide anodes, a rectifying substation to supply direct current, a potline of electrocytic cells for the reduction process, and a cast house to cast billets, slabs, and ingots. The project faces no special risks."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"98,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625093338","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625093338","DocDate":"30-JUN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e427_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e427_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e426_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e426_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e425_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e425_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e8e424_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e424_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e8e423_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e423_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912392618","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912392618","DocDate":"28-FEB-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902322249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902322249","DocDate":"28-FEB-1979"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
