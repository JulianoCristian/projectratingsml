There are four components. The first, Program Strategy and Management, lays the foundation for the COREMAP program. It produces the policy, strategic, and legal framework; project management and assessment of lessons learned; and an independent evaluation of COREMAP I and preparation for COREMAP II. The second component  provides services, workshops, publications, awareness materials, surveys, and awards to support a national multi-media campaign; regional campaigns in COREMAP I pilot provinces; and public relations and dissemination of program guidelines. The third component funds specialized technical assistance, surveillance equipment, studies, surveillance operations, workshops, and incremental staff costs to support a national surveillance and enforcement (S&E) unit; operations at target project sites; and surveillance training. The fourth component, community-based management, improves the condition of coral reef ecosystems in two pilot sites through reef management plans designed, implemented, and monitored by local communities. This component also provides technical assistance, community support services, workshops, training, and village grants."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":37},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":21},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"6,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BG,JB,BC,BH,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"80,79,82,33,85","mjthemecode":"11,3,11,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":37},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":26},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":21},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":13},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050404100536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050404100536","DocDate":"22-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000090341_20040409153141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040409153141","DocDate":"31-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200360286","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200360286","DocURL":"01-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200360487","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200360487","DocURL":"01-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200360789","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200360789","DocURL":"01-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110814","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110814","DocDate":"04-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182418","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182418","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
