Through this agency, namely the Armenian Development Agency (ADA), the project will help develop skills, operational systems, and procedures to facilitate private business needs. The infrastructure and skills development component is intended to compensate staff for the incremental activities under the project, by providing technical support from local consultants, as well as transportation for investor servicing, staff training, and, updating current internet capabilities. The second component will strengthen institutional capacity for investor/exporter servicing, by targeting efforts to improve the quality of information, and, facilitate skills, and training. The investment, and export promotion and generation component, will a) build ADA's professional investment promotion capacity through comprehensive training, and workshops focused on reaching target markets, and, b) strengthen business development capacities focused on export production standards, marketing capabilities, and financial systems, through a substantial skills training program. Based on project performance indicators, the project management component will ensure appropriate monitoring criteria, and evaluation plans."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Armenia!$!AM","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"1,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AM","sectorcode":"BZ,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"45,41,49","mjthemecode":"5,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060731180135","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060731180135","DocDate":"29-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201285257","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201285257","DocDate":"25-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201285257","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201285257","DocURL":"25-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02040504100527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02040504100527","DocDate":"22-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02020104020271","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02020104020271","DocDate":"25-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01120704171956","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01120704171956","DocDate":"28-NOV-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Armenia"}},"facets":{}}
