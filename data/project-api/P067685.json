There are four main project components. The first assists responsible ministries and agencies in defining and institutionalizing effective and long-term resource policies, strategies, and harvesting guidelines by funding consultant services and staff training. The second component finances capacity building and awareness raising for national, regional, and local government agencies; establishes a herbarium in Tamale; develops a GIS-based biodiversity management information system; strengthens the traditional and alternative medicines directorate of the health ministry; gives support to traditional healers associations, traditional birth attendants, and the Ghana Association of Traditional and Alternative Medicines (GHATRAM); and capacity building and awareness raising for civil society and communities. The third component develops biodiversity management and conservation systems for protected area; improves land management and restores degraded lands in six pilots areas; sustains biodiversity in the development of wildlife corridors; sustains medical plant resources; and funds in-situ and ex-situ germplasm. The fourth component supports project management, monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"7,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"JB,BH,BC,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,83,82,80","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11,11,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":43},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":33},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20091021024023","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20091021024023","DocDate":"23-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000011823_20071206134144","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000011823_20071206134144","DocDate":"01-DEC-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052411404075","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052411404075","DocDate":"02-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02022704021041","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022704021041","DocDate":"13-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01032007103422","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032007103422","DocDate":"31-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00121906040862","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121906040862","DocDate":"19-JAN-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
