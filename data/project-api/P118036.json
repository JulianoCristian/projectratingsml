Apart from providing a part of the financing for the anti-crisis plan, the DPL will also enable the Bank to provide technical assistance in the area of institutional strengthening and policy development to a new Government with limited experience in the executive branch. The SSGER DPL will contribute to building a fiscally sustainable medium term development policy and serve as a platform for dialogue with the GoES, opposition parties and civil society on the reform agenda. The DPL is structured around three pillars: a) protecting fiscal space for social expenditures. The DPL will help to protect non-personnel recurrent spending and essential investments that are required to sustain the quality of education and health services, while generating resources from the reduction of the transport subsidy; b) protecting income and consumption of the vulnerable populations.
