There are four main components. The first, social mobilization, contains a social communication sub-component for sensitizing the local population, using various media; and a counseling and referral service for ex-combatants, offering economic and psycho-social counseling and employment referral. The second finances an economic reintegration fund offering a range of support measures for skills enhancement and micro-enterprise development. The third component funds social reintegration, supporting small-scale social infrastructure and activities aimed at reinforcing social cohesion in the ten most severely affected communities. The fourth component assists the rehabilitation of disabled ex-combatants, providing medical services, and prostheses and other aids along with special rehabilitation training and special services to the severely disabled."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Djibouti!$!DJ","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":72},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"2,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"DJ","sectorcode":"BH,BC,JA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"51,58,54,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,6,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":72},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030703110034","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030703110034","DocDate":"27-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022613533452","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022613533452","DocDate":"23-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910500261","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910500261","DocDate":"30-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9903191105132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903191105132","DocDate":"24-NOV-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Djibouti","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
