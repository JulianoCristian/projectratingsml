It has two main objectives. The first objective is to bring about a permanent shift in public expenditure in the power sector. The second objective is to ensure that the energy requirements of the state are met and that consumers are provided with a reliable, high-quality and cost-effective electricity supply by creditworthy and commercially operated power utilities. The project components are: 1) formation of a new legal, regulatory, institutional framework and industry structure; 2) rehabilitation and expansion of the transmission system; 3) rehabilitation and expansion of the sub-transmission and distribution system; 4) implementation of demand-side management measures; and 5) provision of technical assistance and engineering services.
