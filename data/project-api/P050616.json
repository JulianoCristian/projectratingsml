The Second Community Water and Sanitation Project (CWSP2) will be implemented in three 3-year phases. The first phase for CWSP2 aims to increase service coverage, and achieve effective and sustained use of improved community water and sanitation in villages and small towns in four regions. There are two main project components. The Community Subprojects component provides grants to communities and schools through their district assemblies for construction of water and sanitation facilities and finances technical assistance and community development activities to strengthen community capacity to plan, implement, operate, and maintain water and sanitation facilities in an effective and sustainable manner. Community subprojects include protected communal hand-dug wells, communal boreholes equipped with handpumps, a mechanized boreholes, a surface water supply system, a protected spring source, rainwater catchment, and household and school latrines. The second component strengthens stakeholder capacity by supporting the private sector and nongovernmental organizations as providers of hardware and software services, and provides national program development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":33},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Other Health Study,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Working Paper,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"JB,BC,WA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,26,85,84,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,11,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":33},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":32},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20060808123448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060808123448","DocDate":"07-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Other Health Study (HLT),  Vol.1","DocType":"HLT","EntityID":"000334955_20081025043656","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20081025043656","DocDate":"01-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050613090142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050613090142","DocDate":"09-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Working Paper (WP),  Vol.1","DocType":"WP","EntityID":"000334955_20081117051253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20081117051253","DocDate":"31-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99082405303871","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99082405303871","DocDate":"05-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903295974","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903295974","DocDate":"09-JUL-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
