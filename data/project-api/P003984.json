Secondly, the project will support GOI's efforts to develop long-term management policies. The main components of the project are: (a) systematic registration of 1.2 million parcels in ten districts in Java, relying on special systematic adjudication teams capitalizing on economies of scale, cadastral surveying by private firms, utilization of new technology such as global positioning systems (GPS), and dissemination of information to the public; (b) development of a database of land laws and regulations, and assistance to GOI's program for reviewing and drafting land laws and regulation; (c) long-term development of the Land National Agency's (BPN's) institutional capacity for land administration, mostly through support to BPN's training and education units, training, scholarships and studies on ways to improve tenure security for customary (adat) land rights; and (d) an integrated program of studies, seminars and workshops on selected topic areas in land management while improving inter-agency coordination and drawing on international experience."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Other Infrastructure Study,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"36,75,83","mjthemecode":"11,10,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02071304005043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071304005043","DocDate":"19-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Other Infrastructure Study (INF),  Vol.1","DocType":"INF","EntityID":"000456286_20131211122618","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20131211122618","DocDate":"21-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123055728","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123055728","DocURL":"30-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123055728","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123055728","DocDate":"30-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea38ff_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea38ff_1_0","DocDate":"15-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006024039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006024039","DocDate":"16-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006023721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006023721","DocDate":"16-AUG-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
