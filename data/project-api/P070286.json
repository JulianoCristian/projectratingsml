The components will: 1) finance support to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) for the establishment of the National Registry of Farmers, and of the Land Registration and Cadastre Office, which includes a complete computerization of existing land registry records. Institutional capacity building at MARA's provincial, and local offices will be provided, through technical assistance (TA) for registry best practices, training, and provision of equipment, and software; 2) support farmers in the transition to alternative activities, as governmental support is reduced. The cropping area expansion of primarily hazelnut, and tobacco led to significant surplus production, including misuse of agricultural resource bases. Thus, based on the areas to be reduced, payments to farmers will be provided in the form of uprooted costs; input costs for new crops; and, transition costs. Crop replacement options include maize, soybean, sunflower, beans and vegetables, and medicinal plants; 3) assist in the implementation of the Law on Agricultural Sales Cooperatives, through restructuring measures, and cooperative development programs, financing labor retrenchment, and expenses associated with the Restructuring Board. Consulting services, TA, and training will be provided; and, 4) provide project support services, such as public information campaigns, advisory services, monitoring and evaluation, and management activities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Central
