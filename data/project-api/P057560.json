Specifically, it will a) increase the productivity and value of land and other real estate by securing property rights and promoting consolidation of fragmented rural land ownership, and b) facilitate the use of property as collateral and reduce transaction costs in title transfer and mortgage finance by improving the efficiency of rural and urban property markets. The project consists of three components. The first component will support establishing a nationwide common Information and Registration Centers (IRCs) network for a secure registration of real estate parcels and associated rights. It will include training staff in the new system procedures; designing, prototyping, and establishing a computerized title registration management information system in 25 IRCs with linkages to information systems across the cadastral network; and further equipping local IRCs. The second component will support surveying land to produce cadastral maps. It will provide financing to equip and furnish the Mapping Center; contract satellite imagery and finance global positioning system grid enhancement work; and support the non-labor operating costs of the Surveying and Mapping works. The third component will finance equipping and operating a Project Implementation Unit (PIU)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Armenia!$!AM","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AM","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Rural development","Rule of law","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83,36,75,34","mjthemecode":"3,10,3,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040630133842","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040630133842","DocDate":"22-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042613283015","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042613283015","DocDate":"04-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030215042916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030215042916","DocDate":"23-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98111703552797","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703552797","DocDate":"16-SEP-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Armenia"}},"facets":{}}
