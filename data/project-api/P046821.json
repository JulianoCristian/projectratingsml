The project will be implemented over a four-year period. It will finance technical assistance, consulting firms and the acquisition of computer equipment, through five components. Activities in the fraud and error component aim to reduce unwarranted disbursements by desk-checking existing paper files, carrying out on-site visits, and updating the beneficiary database. The second component aims to reorganize agencies to provide one-stop, full-service points of sale, while the remaining components focus on institutional strengthening which introduces a new organizational structure, management techniques, and incentives linked to performance; on project administration with key personnel and accounting and monitoring systems Bank-financed; and lastly, on the absorption into the national system of 22 provincial pension funds, after their files are verified and screened for errors and fraud."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"BE,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,29","mjthemecode":"2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":85},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20060120144023","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060120144023","DocDate":"22-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172330","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200293113","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200293113","DocURL":"17-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200293113","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200293113","DocDate":"17-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172536","DocDate":"30-DEC-1996"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
