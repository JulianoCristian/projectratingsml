The project will have a major component improving the land administration system within the current framework and a minor component implementing the legal and institutional land administration reforms, if and when they are introduced. The major component will support the formulation of a sound and coherent land policy and legislation, carry out land mapping on three million ha to obtain cadastre information and to regularize the land tenure situation wherever possible, indentify 500,000 ha suitable for small farmer settlement and increase the efficiency and transparency of the land administration system. In addition, the project will also finance: 1) title regularization and land settlement programs by the National Land Institute, when established; and 2) the introduction of an integrated legal cadastral registry system when the Legal Cadastral Registry is established."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":6},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal services","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"20,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"BG,BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law","Rule of law"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"36,33,83,35","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"3,11,3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal services","code":"35"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060725162814","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060725162814","DocDate":"28-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01080304115476","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01080304115476","DocDate":"27-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01080304114975","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01080304114975","DocDate":"27-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122045659","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122045659","DocDate":"26-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122045659","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122045659","DocURL":"26-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122045458","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122045458","DocURL":"26-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122045458","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122045458","DocDate":"26-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23ebe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23ebe_1_0","DocDate":"13-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019101559","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019101559","DocDate":"16-MAY-1995"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
