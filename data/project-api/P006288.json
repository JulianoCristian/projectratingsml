Although the project is national in scope, special emphasis will be given to the three priority regions of the North, Northeast and Center-West. About two-thirds of total investments under the project, and about two-thirds of such programs as farming production systems and demonstration field trials included in the project, will be designed to assist smaller farmers whose average annual per capita income is estimated to be below the relative poverty level in Brazil of US$380 equivalent. The proposed project complements the on-going agricultural research project, concentrated in the same three priority regions, and is intended to ensure that the new agricultural technologies developed under the project actually reach the greatest possible number of farmers."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902304776","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902304776","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912375681","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912375681","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c96_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c96_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c94_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c94_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
