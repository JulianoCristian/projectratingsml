The components call for: 1) widening, and strengthening of 800-900 km of high priority state highways, through civil works to be procured in three phases; 2) land acquisition, whose costs, and compensation will be borne by the state government. Conversely, the difference between compensation paid under the land acquisition act, and replacement value of assets acquired (paid in the form of assistance), infrastructure facilities, and resettlement/rehabilitation entitlements, such as allowances, training, and monitoring expenses, will be funded by the Bank; 3) reducing the periodic maintenance backlog of the state, by funding rehabilitation works, to be implemented over a three year period; 4) the design and supervision of civil works, to be implemented by international consultants, who will have full engineering responsibility, in addition to the preparation of bidding documents; 5) building the institutional capacity of the Roads and Buildings Department, as the manager of the state's road network. Technical assistance, training, and equipment supply will be provided, and, 6) funding techno-economic feasibility, and detailed engineering studies, required for a possible follow-up
