This phase will reorganize and strengthen agricultural extension services in 11 administrative districts in the Terai with the objective of achieving early and sustainable improvement in agricultural productivity.  The project will aim to establish a T&V extension infrastructure which will promote the adoption of low-cost and labor-intensive agricultural practices, and sound irrigation water management, thus facilitating better cropping patterns, greater crop diversification and more efficient fertilizer and water usage.  The project will also provide for training of staff and monitoring and evaluation of project activities."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"7,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"NP","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019151538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019151538","DocDate":"21-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135925","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135925","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904162914","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904162914","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0612e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0612e_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAR-1985"}],"countryname":"Nepal"}},"facets":{}}
