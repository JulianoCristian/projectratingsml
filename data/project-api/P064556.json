The credit will provide, and support balance of payments, and increase foreign exchange to facilitate private sector imports to prod economic growth. The civil conflict hindered economic stability, thus the project will be instrumental in the rehabilitation, maintenance, and operation of priority sectors. Counterpart funding will finance public expenditures in health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure sectors, to alleviate poverty, and restore peace. Furthermore, the operation will assist the Government in re-establishing, and improving budget systems, allowing transparency to foster foreign external donors. Policy reforms will be supported, in an effort to improve macroeconomic performance, permitting legislative oversight, and making government activities more transparent. However, the risks include the potential return to widespread violence, increased military expenditures, a reduced political will to negotiate with government opponents, and, above all, inadequate efforts to achieve budget transparency."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Burundi!$!BI","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":20},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Housing construction"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BI","sectorcode":"WZ,YC,EZ,JA,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,62,65,88","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040503111948","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040503111948","DocDate":"27-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201115543","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201115543","DocURL":"08-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_00040806105192","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00040806105192","DocDate":"23-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99111305445944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99111305445944","DocDate":"01-NOV-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Burundi"}},"facets":{}}
