At present most farmers on these schemes are able to cultivate only those parts of their holdings which lie below the level of the irrigation canals. These low lying areas are used exclusively for paddy. The installation of the low lift pumps will enable water to be pumped from the canals to irrigate the land around the homestead sites which are between 15 and 50 feet above the canals. With irrigation, this land is very suitable for growing chillies and onions. At present prices the return per acre will be considerably higher than from paddy and will permit a substantial increase in net farm incomes. The project also includes 400 acres of youth settlement schemes under a plan for settling unemployed educated youth in the 17-21 year age group on 2-acre lift irrigated plots."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"2,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e861_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e861_1_0","DocDate":"19-JUN-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903051784","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903051784","DocDate":"31-MAY-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903493630","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903493630","DocDate":"31-MAY-1968"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
