These objectives will be achieved by: 1) state divestiture from transport operations in favor of a greater involvement of private operators, and institutions more focused on planning, regulation and definition of sector policies; 2) better balance in resource allocation between prudent investments and maintenance expenditures, and sustainable resource mobilization; 3) improved regulatory framework resulting in more liberalization, increased competitiveness and more competition; and 4) development and implementation of a sector policy to protect the environment. The project comprises the following components: 1) civil works on paved roads, unpaved roads, rural roads, port, and the rail and air transports; 2) goods; and 3) technical assistance and training. More specifically, the project will consist of: 1) execution of a three-year time-slice of the road rehabilitation and maintenance program and bridge maintenance program on primary roads of the priority network; 2) execution of a rural transport infrastructure maintenance program; 3) construction of two weighing stations; 4) purchase of data processing supplies and equipment of related offices; 5) provision of technical assistance and consulting services; 6) training; and 7) surveys and seminars."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cameroon!$!CM","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"60,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CM","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"78,84,45,43","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,5,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":86},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040702092141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040702092141","DocDate":"24-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121283632","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121283632","DocURL":"10-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121283632","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121283632","DocDate":"10-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019215213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019215213","DocDate":"18-APR-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cameroon","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
