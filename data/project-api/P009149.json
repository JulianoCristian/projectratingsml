The site for the project is a small peninsula, about 4 km to the north of the old walled city of Dubrovnik. Partly pine-covered, the area slopes gently from a high point to the sea. It has about 1.5 km of indented rocky coastline, and about 0.5 km to the northeast is the small island of Daksa which has sandy beaches and dense woods. Because of its topography the site offers panoramic views of the sea and surrounding islands, and it has a slightly more favorable climate than the old city. Besides the great scenic beauty of the mountains coastline, the palaces, churches and monasteries of the old city are tourism assets in themselves and provide a unique setting for a summer festival offering music, drama, opera and dance which is a major attraction for tourists. The project is one of the largest so far developed in Yugoslavia or elsewhere. It will include nine hotels with a total of about 5,000 beds; one hotel will be in the luxury class with 300 beds, four will be A class with 1,700 beds, and the remainder B class with 3,000 beds. The four B class hotels will operate seasonally (April-October)."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other urban development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other urban development"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"UY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other urban development","code":"UY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903184983","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903184983","DocDate":"30-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903314657","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903314657","DocDate":"30-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a4f7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a4f7_1_0","DocDate":"17-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a4f6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a4f6_1_0","DocDate":"17-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e6a4f5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a4f5_1_0","DocDate":"17-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e6a4f4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a4f4_1_0","DocDate":"17-JUN-1971"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
