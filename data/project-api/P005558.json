A factory with a daily capacity to process 300 m tons of cotton seed equivalent would be constructed and equipped at Deir ez Zor; two existing factories in Aleppo would be modernized by the provision of solvent extraction process equipment and a third factory modified; and technical assistance for engineering and design, supervision of construction, test runs and initial operation, training Syrian technicians and a study of the vegetable oil subsector would be provided. At full development vegetable oil processing efficiency and capacity would be increased resulting in an annual gross incremental value of $5.6 million. The financial benefits would accrue to the Government; the incremental oil production would benefit Syrian consumers who would be able to purchase larger quantities of vegetable oil, while increased by-products would benefit some 500,000 livestock farmers by providing a relatively inexpensive supply of feed for the dry season. A failure to increase the availability of oilseeds is the principal risk faced. Technical risks are negligible since processes are tested and proven."},"country_namecode":"Syrian Arab Republic!$!SY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"21,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"SY","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912591887","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912591887","DocDate":"21-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902312540","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902312540","DocDate":"30-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912405938","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912405938","DocDate":"30-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3b2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3b2_1_0","DocDate":"21-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3b0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3b0_1_0","DocDate":"21-NOV-1978"}],"countryname":"Syrian Arab Republic"}},"facets":{}}
