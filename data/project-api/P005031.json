This Stage I program is expected to raise the production level of the plant from about 0.9 million tons per year (tpy) of liquid steel to about 1.2 million tpy by 1987, mainly by removing technical production bottlenecks but also through substantial improvements in operation/maintenance practices and methods needed for attainment of increased productivity. Under the project, correction of serious deficiencies in present operating practices and production methods is also expected to result in substantial reductions in the cost of production mainly through improved process control, higher metallic yields, and reduced consumption of energy. The equipment package consists of items for all major operating centers and supporting services such as: raw material handling, iron-making, steel-making, continuous casting, rolling and utilities, including replacement of most instruments and weighing equipment, installation of pollution monitoring equipment, acquisition of computer facilities and installation of energy saving equipment."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Industrial restructuring","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"64,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Industrial restructuring"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"IR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industrial restructuring","code":"IR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925030056","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925030056","DocDate":"23-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190237456","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190237456","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912531969","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912531969","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e972f6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e972f6_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e972f5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e972f5_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAY-1981"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
