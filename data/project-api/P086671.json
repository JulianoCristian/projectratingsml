The medium- term goal is that teachers and students will use a wider range of appropriate methods in teaching and learning, and that system management (including policy development, implementation, monitoring and fiduciary oversight) is strengthened. The closing date for project will be extended by six months from March 31, 2011 until September 30, 2011. This extension is necessary to provide sufficient time to complete the civil works and school furniture and equipment contracts from the action plan, as well as several ongoing civil works contracts, which would enable full absorption of the remaining loan funds. This will be the second extension of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Croatia!$!HR","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary
