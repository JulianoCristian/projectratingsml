The PRSGC-3 is the third and final in a series of annual Development Policy Operations (DPO) supporting the Government of Lesotho's (GoL) development program laid out in its interim national development framework and growth strategy, and consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY10-14. The operation will be a grant and credit, totaling US$18 million. It comes at a time when the GoL is coping with the shocks precipitated by the global financial crisis which have affected growth and public finances adversely, and led to a significant deterioration in Lesotho's near-term economic outlook. The operation takes cognizance of the need for macroeconomic stabilization and the implied constraints, while continuing to support the longer term developmental program of the country. Macroeconomic conditions deteriorated sharply after 2008, reflecting the adverse impacts of the global economic crisis. Economic growth slowed down from 4.7 percent in 2008 to 2.5 percent in 2009 due to reduced demand for diamond and textile exports, and the recovery since has been slower than expected. In response, GoL has adopted a medium-term program designed to restore macroeconomic sustainability, while retaining the longer-term focus on broad-based growth for poverty reduction."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Lesotho!$!LS","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>LS \u2212 Troisi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>L\u2019objectif du Programme du troisi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSGC-3) du Lesotho est de soutenir la strat\u00e9gie de croissance du gouvernement et son cadre politique \u00e0 moyen terme pour le r\u00e9tablissement de la stabilit\u00e9 macro-\u00e9conomique dans le prolongement de la crise financi\u00e8re mondiale.
