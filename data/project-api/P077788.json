The project would achieve these objectives by providing technical assistance to: (1) elaborate and implement a national plan to improve Peru's competitiveness drawing from locally-generated regional strategies, and partnerships with the private sector; (2) strengthening mechanisms of interaction, and cooperation between private, and public parties at regional, national, and local levels; (3) disseminating information, and training to the private sector, and selected public sector institutions; (4) conducting pilot and small scale initiatives to test alternative schemes to improve quality, and productivity; (5) analyzing new market opportunities, instruments for trade facilitation, inefficiencies in the distribution chain, and export processing, and, preparing design, and feasibility studies for infrastructure bottlenecks in transport logistics; and (6) refocusing, and overhauling key, public sector entities to achieve their institutional objectives, and boost Peru's competitiveness."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de asistencia t\u00e9cnica para facilitar el comercio y mejorar la productividad</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"BH,YZ,YY,TZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"45,41,49","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"5,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Other domestic and international trade","code":"YY"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":35},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":15},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090814001543","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090814001543","DocDate":"29-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202200367","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202200367","DocDate":"11-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202200367","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202200367","DocURL":"11-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20030519103725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030519103725","DocDate":"09-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0210290402079","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0210290402079","DocDate":"21-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02102504231583","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02102504231583","DocDate":"17-OCT-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
