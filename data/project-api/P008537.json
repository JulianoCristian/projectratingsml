These components were chosen because they are of high priority, can be implemented rapidly, would maximize the impact of Bank funds, and bring about a beneficial impact on the electricity subsector and prepare the electricity system for interconnection with Western European networks. The electricity components are complementary to a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development administered project (under the grant from the Nuclear Safety Account)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Lithuania!$!LT","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"26,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LT","sectorcode":"BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,39","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030619110358","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030619110358","DocDate":"17-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200140592","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200140592","DocURL":"27-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200140693","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200140693","DocDate":"27-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200140391","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200140391","DocDate":"27-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200140592","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200140592","DocDate":"27-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200140391","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200140391","DocURL":"27-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200140693","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200140693","DocURL":"27-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99c52_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99c52_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99c50_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99c50_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006035841","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006035841","DocDate":"04-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006035523","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006035523","DocDate":"04-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Lithuania"}},"facets":{}}
