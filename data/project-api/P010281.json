Further, the project aims to promote a refinery pricing system that will provide adequate incentives for efficiency improvements, and assist Government in formulating an optimal investment program for the refinery sector as a whole.  With this in mind, the project includes (i) balancing and modernization of the crude processing unit; (ii) a captive power plant; (iii) debottlenecking of the hydo-treater and platformer; and (iv) process modifications to lube unit I.  In addition, the project supports (v) efficiency improvement measures; and (vi) studies, training, technical assistance, research and development.  These measures, identified under the previous refinery engineering project, will yield significant benefits at relatively low incremental cost, by modifying existing process units and adding ancilliary facilities."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":69},"sector2":{"Name":"Power","Percent":31},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"21,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"LD,LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,39,84","mjthemecode":"11,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":69},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":31}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970909142806","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970909142806","DocDate":"17-JUN-1997"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
