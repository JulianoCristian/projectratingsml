It will test new institutional arrangements executed through the Ministry of Universities (MU).  These arrangements will be a precursor to an autonomous intermediary institution for the allocation of government funds to higher education that is expected to emerge from the refrom process.  It supports investment proposals selected from those proposed by the participating universities in the framework of their medium-term institutional development plans.  Both the plans and the investment proposals will be subject to rigorous peer review and benefit from international scientific advice.  The draft development plans reviewed by the Bank involve delegation of authority to the participating universities to enter into contractual arrangements with third parties while keeping full control over the resulting income and over all stages of procurement of goods and services."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"65,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"66","mjthemecode":"8,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000425962_20121113143353","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000425962_20121113143353","DocDate":"08-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032215425790","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032215425790","DocDate":"27-FEB-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929180207","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929180207","DocDate":"18-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929175926","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929175926","DocDate":"05-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000356161_20100824013835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20100824013835","DocDate":"05-OCT-1990"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
