It would achieve this by strengthening extension and research in the area, and improving supportive infrastructure.  The project would have an import substitution impact and increase farm incomes.  The project would consist of provision of extension, research and livestock services, farm machinery testing, rural roads upgrading, project management, training, technical assistance, studies and credit for on-farm investments, seasonal inputs and input resale centers.  The project would raise the incomes of about 4,500 farmers and 24 production cooperatives.  The risk that farmers might adopt the new project technology more slowly than expected is minimized by projection of realistic adoption rates and by ensuring the adequacy of incentives and the availability of inputs on credit."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925222822","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925222822","DocDate":"09-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135712","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904163227","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904163227","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
