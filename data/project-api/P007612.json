The project will have three main components: 1) strengthening of federal institutions, local governments and operating agencies which play a key role in development of the sector; 2) supporting the investment needs of participating cities through implementation of comprehensive and integrated solid waste management plans; and 3) providing support for scavengers and informal workers impacted by the project through a social component."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Solid waste management","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
