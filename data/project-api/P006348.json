PADCT provides for research and human resources development in six fields: Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Biotechnology, Geosciences and Mineral Technology, Instrumentation, Science Education, and Science Planning and Management. PADCT also includes four National Science Service Programs to address sector-wide service deficiencies: Basic Industrial Technology, Science Information, Chemical Reagents and Research Consumables, and Spare Parts and Maintenance. These combined efforts are expected to result in better quality and efficiency in research and human resource development projects, multiyear finance for such projects, and more cost effective services for the science and technology sector."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"72,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006173232","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006173232","DocDate":"14-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151640","DocDate":"31-JAN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904163313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904163313","DocDate":"31-JAN-1985"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
