Specifically the project will provide for rehabilitation and maintenance of main roads and priority feeeder roads. It will also provide for restructuring and role strengthening of the Ministry of Public Works (MTP), the decentralization of its functions and the contracting of maintenance works to private contractors. Training will be provided to upgrade the skills of domestic contractors. Changes will be made in the CATP (MTP Training school) to enhance the validity of its diplomas and certificates.
