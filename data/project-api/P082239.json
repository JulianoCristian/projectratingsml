This is a level two restructuring which is necessary to allow savings of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan proceeds to be utilized for preparing the Second National Hydrometeorological (Hydromet) Modernization Project. It also reflects more accurate funding needs by each category of expenditure based on the latest disbursements and commitments. The restructuring does not involve any change to the project development objectives or associated outcome targets. Since this restructuring involves changing the project description and adding a category of expenditure in the disbursement table in addition to the reallocation and extension of the project's closing
