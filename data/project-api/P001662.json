The subsidiary objectives are to improve the quality of power supply and to strengthen energy sector institutions to plan and manage energy sector activities at sectoral and sub-sectoral levels.  The power component comprises:  (a) increasing the hydro generation capacity by 50MW through the construction of the first phase of a hydroelectric power plant at Kapichira Falls, including related transmission system expansion, and engineering services for design and supervision; (b) rehabilitation of the existing hydro, standby gas turbine and diesel power plants to improve their availability; (c) reinforcing and expanding the transmission and distribution systems, to improve reliability, reduce losses and connect new consumers; (d) strengthening the Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi through the provision of computer hardware and software, studies and training.  The non-power component will:  (a) assist in energy planning and policy formulation through provision of technical assistance; (b) support the Petroleum Control Commission in least cost petroleum product sourcing through technical assistance; and (c) provide technical assistance to the Tobacco Control Commission in improving barn design for smallholder tobacco curing, to reduce woodfuel consumption."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"55,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Renewable energy"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"LE,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development"],"themecode":"74","mjthemecode":"9,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":98},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0102240538184","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0102240538184","DocDate":"27-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121114323","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121114323","DocURL":"02-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121114524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121114524","DocDate":"02-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121113822","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121113822","DocDate":"02-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121114323","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121114323","DocDate":"02-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121113822","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121113822","DocURL":"02-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121114524","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121114524","DocURL":"02-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e39561_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e39561_1_0","DocDate":"17-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e3955f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3955f_1_0","DocDate":"17-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002013744","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002013744","DocDate":"19-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002013550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002013550","DocDate":"19-MAY-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
