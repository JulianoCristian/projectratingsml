The project components will: 1) provide rapid exit and resolution of insolvent banks, by financing TA to the Super-intendency of Banks (SB) to establish benchmarks to assess viability, and solvency of banks, by designing templates to prepare, and evaluate bank's rehabilitation plans. Legal and financial instruments will be designed for the transfer of liabilities from insolvent, to solvent banks, and for the transfer of assets to a special trust while compensation mechanisms will be established for institutions acquiring assets, and liabilities from insolvent banks; 2) establish the Fiduciary Fund for Bank Capitalization, providing TA for its operation, including the design of financial instruments to capitalize viable banks. Policy and strategic formulation will be addressed, and the evolution of capitalized banks will be monitored; 3) finance TA to establish a credit information system to centralize, organize, and maintain information of debtors of financial institutions in Guatemala. The acquisition of operational software and hardware will encourage better lending practices, and improve the overall financial system; and, 4) finance TA to strengthen the Special Unit Against Money Laundering, including training, and supervisory assistance. Moreover, TA will support the adoption of international accounting standards by the Central Bank, and a strategy for the financial system development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guatemala!$!GT","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Pr\u00e9stamo de Asistencia T\u00e9cnica para el Sector Financiero</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"General finance sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"GT","sectorcode":"FZ,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,42","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":50},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20091231005423","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091231005423","DocDate":"16-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202193046","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202193046","DocDate":"13-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202193046","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202193046","DocURL":"13-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02061304013327","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02061304013327","DocDate":"07-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000012009_20040422101030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040422101030","DocDate":"03-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02051004123438","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02051004123438","DocDate":"03-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02051704110899","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02051704110899","DocDate":"09-MAY-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guatemala"}},"facets":{}}
