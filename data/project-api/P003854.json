The project would focus on six key government research institutes in science and technology, which would provide a pool of qualified candidates for advanced training. The project would provide overseas and local training and technical assistance in establishing a management system and graduate reintegration program. The main benefit of the project would be the improved technical and managerial competence of the project institutes' staff and an increase in the country's stock of well-trained scientific and technical manpower. The project would also have a long-term impact on the university system. The major risk arises from the complexities of managing such a sizable and diverse overseas fellowship program. The technical assistance to support the establishment of a management system should reduce this risk."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"93,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970723102656","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970723102656","DocDate":"30-JUN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095019","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095019","DocDate":"30-JUN-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
