This memorandum seeks your approval for a second restructuring of the project in order to complete the remaining activities. The changes consist of: (i) extending the closing date by six months, from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012; and (ii) do a reallocation of the credit proceeds, to support the achievement of the Project Development Objectives (PDO) of this second phase of the Adaptable Program Lending (APL), and also enable an additional financing to the project to be approved during the first quarter of 2012. The purpose of the restructuring is to extend the project closing date so as to complete essential activities of phase 2 of APL, and avoid any disruption in the activities of the project until the approval of the Additional Financing. To this end, a reallocation of funds would be also necessary between categories in favor of fundamental activities related to (i) consultants services to complete essential major study on land tenure, and (ii) needed funds to finish ongoing rehabilitation of perimeters."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania!$!MR","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and
