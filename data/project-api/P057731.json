The project has five components. The first funds public transport improvement measures comprising integration between modes, improvement of interchange facilities, and measures for introducing public transport priority; traffic management; measures for controlling inappropriate frontage activity and measures for improving road safety for pedestrians by providing sidewlaks and other facilities; measures for bicycles and pedicabs; and safe bicycle parking at stations. Landscaping and greening will be included in all project components. The second component improves access to the MARIPAS-Marikina Valley area (Marikina, Rizal, and Pasig), specificallyrelieving the Marcos Highway/Aurora Boulevard corridor and establishing an at-grade traffic management scheme--which will act as an efficient conduit for traffic to and from Metro Manila, and extending a critical road section. The third component comprises improvements to secondary roads such as pavement rehabilitation and drainage and sidewalk improvements. The fourth component supports non-motorized transport and the fifth component builds capacity in traffic management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":81},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":16},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Resettlement Plan,Resettlement Plan,Resettlement Plan,Environmental Assessment,Resettlement Plan,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"BH,TZ,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,71","mjthemecode":"9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":81},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":16},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20110912070442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20110912070442","DocDate":"29-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201545671","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201545671","DocURL":"08-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201545570","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201545570","DocURL":"08-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99040606001148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99040606001148","DocDate":"25-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060804031083","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060804031083","DocDate":"23-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.3","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_01051005004082","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01051005004082","DocDate":"01-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.4","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_01053004120552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01053004120552","DocDate":"30-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.2","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_01051005003981","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01051005003981","DocDate":"01-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00090806212326","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00090806212326","DocDate":"31-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_00082205414568","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082205414568","DocDate":"31-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00060905451063","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00060905451063","DocDate":"27-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00061505313027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00061505313027","DocDate":"31-JUL-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
