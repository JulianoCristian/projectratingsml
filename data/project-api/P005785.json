It will also assist the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in the establishment of extension centers in the border governorates of Saadah and Hajjah. The project comprises: (a) infrastructure development (civil works, equipment and supplies) needed to support credit activities and extension services; (b) technical assistance and training in several key areas of CACB operations; and (c) funds to assist CACB to expand its lending program. The proposed project's main benefit would be to strengthen CACB as an institution and thereby establish a solid foundation for the ongoing provision of agricultural credit to Yemeni farmers to enable them in turn to finance the irrigation schemes, tractors, improved seeds, fertilizers and other inputs which they need to expand their production."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925145757","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925145757","DocDate":"28-JAN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05ba9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05ba9_1_0","DocDate":"14-DEC-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05ba6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05ba6_1_0","DocDate":"14-DEC-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902404887","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902404887","DocDate":"30-NOV-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901000585","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901000585","DocDate":"30-NOV-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
