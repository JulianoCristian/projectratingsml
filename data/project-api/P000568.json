It will support the divestiture of public enterprises, introduce a competitive environment in the utility and petroleum sectors and facilitate private sector development. More specifically, the project will: help the Government prepare regulatory frameworks for the five major public enterprises in control of petroleum distribution, transportation, telecummunications, power and water distribution and open the sectors up to competition progressively; conduct the privatization of these major public enterprises; liquidate other non-viable public enterprises; and support regulation and competition in the financial sector and reforms in banking institutions. To achieve this objective the project comprises the following four components: 1) a regulation and privatization component whereby consulting services will be provided to prepare pro-competition regulatory frameworks and build a minimal level of public sector capacity to regulate the major utilities, as well as to advise the Government on privatization of the five concerned public enterprises; 2) a public enterprise sector liquidation in which assistance will be provided to liquidate all non-viable enterprises; 3) reform of financial institutions and the public sector which will finance the development of proposals for restructuring the financial sector; and 4) a communications campaign which will finance a public information campaign to inform stakeholders and the public of the benefits and implications of the reform program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Congo!$!CG","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":49},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"General information and communications sector","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"General information and communications sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Technical Annex","countrycode":"CG","sectorcode":"LZ,WZ,CZ,TZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,43","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"General information and communications sector","code":"CZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":49},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":15},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":12},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":12},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00032405341282","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00032405341282","DocDate":"02-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121271488","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121271488","DocDate":"11-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121271488","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121271488","DocURL":"11-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23f34_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23f34_1_0","DocDate":"05-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000333037_20120106001145","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120106001145","DocDate":"25-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961008054120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008054120","DocDate":"25-JUL-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Congo"}},"facets":{}}
