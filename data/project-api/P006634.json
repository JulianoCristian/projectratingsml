Three components are included in the project. First, a policy adjustment component to support a set of measures to strengthen securities markets by: (a) improving the market infrastructure; (b) allowing the development of additional investment instruments; and (c) liberalizing investment restrictions on the main institutional investors. The banks will also be strengthened by permitting them to extend the range of their business and increase their capitalization. The second component is a credit line to benefit the leasing sector. This sector has grown substantially but is now facing a financing shortage that will limit its ability to meet demand. Finally, a technical assistance component to be financed entirely by the Japanese Grant Facility, will strengthen governmental institutions that supervise or interface with the financial sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":31},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":38},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"130,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Capital markets"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"General finance sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"FZ,FA,FK","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,39,40","mjthemecode":"4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":31},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":31},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":38}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029210219","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029210219","DocDate":"07-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007183115","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007183115","DocDate":"14-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061514084872","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061514084872","DocDate":"13-JUL-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031711172873","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031711172873","DocDate":"07-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042015590074","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042015590074","DocDate":"07-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928044629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928044629","DocDate":"16-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928044507","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928044507","DocDate":"16-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061514062071","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061514062071","DocDate":"08-SEP-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile"}},"facets":{}}
