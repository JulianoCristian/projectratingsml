Other objectives of the project are to: 1) maintain the electricity demand-supply balance by increasing the thermal capacity of the system and implementing an energy efficiency program; 2) improve the capacity of Energie du Mali (EDM) to properly operate, maintain and supervise its power generation facilities; and 3) prepare a long-term institutional framework and regulatory system for the power sector and implement it as of 1999. The project consists of the following components: 1) rehabilitation of Selingue hydropower facility including dam, power plant and transmission system; 2) maintenance of the demand/supply balance which comprises the reinforcement of the thermal capacity and an energy efficiency program; 3) strengthening of EDM's management capacity; and 4) long-term institutional framework."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"27,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,85,39,40","mjthemecode":"4,4,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03011704044385","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03011704044385","DocDate":"23-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123394723","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123394723","DocURL":"13-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123394723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123394723","DocDate":"13-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123394622","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123394622","DocURL":"13-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123394622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123394622","DocDate":"13-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961022111321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022111321","DocDate":"28-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022111406","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022111406","DocDate":"28-MAR-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
