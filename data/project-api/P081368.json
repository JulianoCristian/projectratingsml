The purpose of the reallocation is to adjust some of the categories in order to meet the Government's ongoing and planned commitments by focusing on priority actions to essentially better cover increasing cost of civil works and grants associated respectively with: (i) the construction of feeder's roads; and (ii) the implementation of village community's development plan. The extension is required to allow the country to complete all project activities. This will in particular provide the time and resources to: (i) complete construction works for the feeder roads; and (ii) allow time for technical support for at least one year to the last village communities benefitting from funding to implement their development plans. The extension will also allow the recipient to make up for the time lost due to 2008-2009 political turmoil in Mauritania."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of
