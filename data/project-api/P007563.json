The project also aims at strengthening NdeM's operating performance and financial situation through an agreed plan of action. Investments will be made principally in track rehabilitation, motive power and rolling stock expansion and modernization, communications improvements, and technical assistance. A shortfall in the realization of forecast traffic and in financial performance are the main risks. However, in view of Mexico's rapidly growing economy and the need for transport services as well as the Government's stated policies on tariffs, these risks are acceptable."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925053145","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925053145","DocDate":"25-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925053105","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925053105","DocDate":"26-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e975b7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975b7_1_0","DocDate":"16-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e975b6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975b6_1_0","DocDate":"16-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902363549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902363549","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912505537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912505537","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
