GSIF mobilizes public and private resources and channels them through small investments. The project's secondary objectives are to a) strengthen the capacity of private, small-scale contractors and build the capacity of communities; b) generate employment; and c) build greater capacity for policymakers to monitor and analyze poverty trends. The project has four components: 1) Rehabilitating small-scale infrastructure, about 400 microprojects, including civil works improving water supply, sanitation, solid waste management; and rehabilitating local clinics, primary schools, and feeder roads; 2) Providing equipment, vehicles, salaries, operating costs, training, technical assistance; and financing for monitoring and evaluating implementation; 3) Building the capacity of small contractors to prepare bids and execute work contracts; providing training and technical assistance to communities; financing contracts with individuals, firms, and nongovernmental organizations to provide others with technical assistance; and funding regional launch workshops; and 4) Financially supporting the statistics department's (SDS) budget for conducting living standards monitoring surveys (LSM); and offering it technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":23},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":22},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GE","sectorcode":"BC,WZ,JA,EP,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,51,41,78","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,4,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Education","Percent":23},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":23},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080805041701","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080805041701","DocDate":"27-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123470614","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123470614","DocURL":"21-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123471017","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123471017","DocURL":"21-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123470413","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123470413","DocURL":"21-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123470816","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123470816","DocURL":"21-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980203114900","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980203114900","DocDate":"11-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183940","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183940","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Georgia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
