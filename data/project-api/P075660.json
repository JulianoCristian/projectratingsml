In particular, the project will assist the government to a) strengthen institutional capacity and formulate economic policy, and b) address urgent needs and pilot implementation solutions. In terms of strengthening institutional capacity and formulating economic policy, the capacity building for management of donor assistance component will assist the government in building capacity to manage external assistance, so as to prepare the ground for the recovery phase during which levels of external assistance are expected to be large. The support to good governance and economic management component will address priority capacity building and technical assistance needs in the next twelve months. To address urgent needs and piloting implementation solutions, the HIV/AIDS component will finance a scale-up of activities using those agencies that already have a track record of successful implementation in the respective areas. The community driven development pilot fund will support community driven development activities in rural areas. The infrastructure component will focus on only one road which have the most potential for immediate impact on the livelihood of a large part of the population. The unallocated US$3 million will be kept for flexible use."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of the Congo!$!ZR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":48},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":16},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":6},"sector5":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Technical Annex","countrycode":"ZR","sectorcode":"BG,JB,JA,TA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,28,25,27,40","mjthemecode":"4,2,2,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":48},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":29},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":16},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":6},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20051228104558","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20051228104558","DocDate":"01-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_01072504014736","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072504014736","DocDate":"09-JUL-2001"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"}},"facets":{}}
