The project will support implementation of the Government's ongoing energy sector restructuring program and it comprises: 1) an investment component consisting of investments in equipment to optimize the existing district heating system; and 2) technical assistance through consultancy services, studies and staff training. The project scope can be summarized as follows: a) reduction of water losses; b) improvement of water quality; c) reduction of heat losses; d) introduction of automation, controls and metering at the substation level; e) improvement of network monitoring; f) conversion of system control from fixed to variable flow; g) enhancement of system load dispatching capability; h) elimination of small heat-only boilers; i) a consumer installations pilot program; and j) technical assistance and training."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,84","mjthemecode":"11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01072804041380","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072804041380","DocDate":"28-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200160466","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200160466","DocURL":"30-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200160667","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200160667","DocDate":"30-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200160466","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200160466","DocDate":"30-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200160667","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200160667","DocURL":"30-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d41_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d41_1_0","DocDate":"17-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d40_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d40_1_0","DocDate":"17-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006090043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006090043","DocDate":"01-OCT-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006085818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006085818","DocDate":"01-OCT-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland"}},"facets":{}}
