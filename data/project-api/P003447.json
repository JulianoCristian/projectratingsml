In addition, the project would support the Government's program for completing the national road network by constructing or improving about 230 km out of a total 4,000 km of missing links in the network. It would also support a national program of improving economic activity in rural areas through the construction or improvement of about 1,400 km of rural roads."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u7b2c\u4e00\u516c\u8def\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u534f\u52a9\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u91c7\u53d6\u4ee5\u4e0b\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u79cd\u4ea4\u901a\u8fd0\u8f93\u9700\u6c42\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u53ca\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u5b8c\u5584\u5efa\u8bbe\u548c\u6750\u6599\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eca\u540e\u5efa\u8bbe\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5584\u516c\u8def\u6295\u8d44\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8bc4\u4ef7\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5b9e\u65bd\u5176\u65b0\u51fa\u53f0\u7684\u516c\u5171\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u62db\u6807\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u516c\u8def\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u5c55\u516c\u8def\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5176\u91cd\u70b9\u5185\u5bb9\u4e3a\u6539\u9020\u5e76\u52a0\u56fa\u73b0\u6709\u56fd\u9053\u7f51\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u62e5\u5835\u5730\u533a\u516c\u8def\u901a\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6539\u5584\u516c\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u72b6\u51b5\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65bd\u57f9\u8bad\u8ba1\u5212\u589e\u52a0\u516c\u8def\u884c\u4e1a\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5efa\u8bbe\u6216\u6539\u9020\u56fd\u9053\u7f51\u4e2d4000\u516c\u91cc\u5c1a\u672a\u8fde\u901a\u8def\u6bb5\u7684\u7ea6230\u516c\u91cc\u8def\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5b9e\u65bd\u65e8\u5728\u5b8c\u6210\u56fd\u9053\u7f51\u5efa\u8bbe\u7684\u89c4\u5212\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u8bbe\u6216\u6539\u9020\u7ea61400\u516c\u91cc\u519c\u6751\u516c\u8def\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65bd\u5168\u56fd\u519c\u6751\u516c\u8def\u6539\u9020\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6d3b\u529b\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"72,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925220535","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925220535","DocDate":"29-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e06184_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e06184_1_0","DocDate":"14-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702140333","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702140333","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101544","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101544","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
