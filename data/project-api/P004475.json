The project would assist in establishing a national system of fishery training to supply appropriately trained professional and technical manpower, strengthen research, and improve the knowledge and skills of fishermen. It would develop the University of the Philippines in the Visayas, College of Fisheries as a center of excellence for professional fishery training and research, and would establish seven Regional Institutes of Fishery Technology for technician-level training. These institutions would train 30% of the professional and technical manpower needed between 1979 and 1990 to help develop the fishery sector. In addition, seven Regional Centers for Fishermen Training would be established adjacent to the Institutes. During the same period, these nonformal fishery training centers would directly benefit about 10% of the country's existing small-scale fishermen and all the existing extension workers through in-service training courses."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"38,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924223525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924223525","DocDate":"25-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e958dc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958dc_1_0","DocDate":"18-DEC-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902340059","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902340059","DocDate":"30-NOV-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912470313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912470313","DocDate":"30-NOV-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
