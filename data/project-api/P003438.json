The project will provide safe drinking water to some six million people in 4,650 villages of 25 counties located in the provinces of Liaoning, Shaanxi, Sichuan and Zhejiang and the municipality of Beijing.  The types of water systems range from handpumps and rainwater storage tanks to pumped and piped systems (including some with treatment) with standpipes or house connections, dependent upon environmental and economic conditions.  The institutional component of the project includes:  (i) the development of management and monitoring systems as well as regulations for revolving funds, construction and operations.  This component further involves; (ii) the preparation of design, construction and operation manuals; and (iii) a training program for trainers, planners, engineers, technicians and operators at the national, provincial, county and village levels."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u519c\u6751\u4f9b\u6c34\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5efa\u8bbe\u4f9b\u6c34\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5e76\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u6751\u4f9b\u6c34\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u65bd\u4f53\u5236\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u548c\u6280\u672f\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5411\u8fbd\u5b81\u3001\u9655\u897f\u3001\u56db\u5ddd\u3001\u6d59\u6c5f\u548c\u5317\u4eac\u4e94\u7701\u5e0225\u4e2a\u53bf\uff08\u5e02\u3001\u533a\uff094650\u4e2a\u6751\u7684600\u4e07\u5de6\u53f3\u4eba\u53e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u996e\u6c34\u3002\u4f9b\u6c34\u7cfb\u7edf\u7c7b\u578b\u7e41\u591a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u5305\u62ec\u624b\u52a8\u6cf5\u3001\u96e8\u6c34\u96c6\u84c4\u6c60\u3001\u914d\u6709\u7ad6\u7ba1\u6216\u5165\u6237\u8fde\u63a5\u7ba1\u7684\u7ba1\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u90e8\u5206\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u3002\u5236\u5ea6\u5b50\u9879\u76ee\u5185\u5bb9\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5236\u5b9a\u5468\u8f6c\u91d1\u3001\u65bd\u5de5\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u76d1\u6d4b\u5236\u5ea6\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u7f16\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u65bd\u5de5\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u624b\u518c\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5411\u4e2d\u592e\u3001\u7701\u3001\u53bf\u3001\u6751\u5404\u7ea7\u57f9\u8bad\u5e08\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u4eba\u5458\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u3001\u6280\u672f\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u57f9\u8bad\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Rural water supply and sanitation","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Rural water supply and sanitation"}],"docty":"Brief,Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"WR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Rural water supply and sanitation","code":"WR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333038_20081029035504","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081029035504","DocDate":"01-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000094946_02110204012261","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02110204012261","DocDate":"16-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006231009","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006231009","DocDate":"30-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925215804","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925215804","DocDate":"30-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e06157_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e06157_1_0","DocDate":"11-APR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e06148_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e06148_1_0","DocDate":"11-APR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101243","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151537","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
