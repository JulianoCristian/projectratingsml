Quick disbursing financing will be provided for critical goods for reconstruction, economic recovery and mitigation of the social crisis, and for financial management, consistent with the emergency nature of this operation, these arrangements have been simplified and streamlined to the extent feasible. However, risks remain, above all, the presence of radical elements among the union-indigenous movement opposed to the current political environment, and, the unsure political power to ensure new legislation. In addition, civil service capacity constraints may undermine implementation of new policies, and, the gas referendum may prove difficult to implement."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"14,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"JA,AH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,54,21","mjthemecode":"1,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":60},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050216150543","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050216150543","DocDate":"27-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202162124","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202162124","DocURL":"19-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202162124","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202162124","DocDate":"19-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000012009_20031212112231","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20031212112231","DocDate":"08-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000012009_20031218125005","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20031218125005","DocDate":"08-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000160016_20031211103804","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20031211103804","DocDate":"05-DEC-2003"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
