The project supports the objectives of GOI's national water policy and the Bank's strategy for India's water sector and policy regarding water resources management. Special attention will be paid to standardization of criteria, processes and procedures for measurement of hydrological parameters and for storage and retrieval of information so that data series will be compatible and the data bases will be interactive. The project will be structured as a six-year operation and include support of: upgrading and expanding the physical infrastructure for all aspects of the collection, collation, processing and dissemination of hydrological and hydrometeorological data; provision of equipment and materials; institutional strengthening including technical assistance and training; and new buildings and
