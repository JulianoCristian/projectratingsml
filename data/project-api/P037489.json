To cope with the extreme shortage of competent agricultural research talent in Spain, the project was developed along two major lines: (a) mission oriented research to handle key agricultural problems, and (b) upgrading of local research staff through a fellowship training program and on-the-job training with research specialists recruited abroad. The project would establish within INIA six national research centers, each specialized in one agricultural commodity or a group of related agricultural commodities of national significance, as opposed to the previous practice of multipurpose research centers which each provided a complete coverage of the agricultural research field."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Spain!$!ES","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Research"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ES","sectorcode":"AR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Research","code":"AR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912572678","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912572678","DocDate":"31-DEC-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903182853","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903182853","DocDate":"31-MAY-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a4c9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a4c9_1_0","DocDate":"18-MAY-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903202647","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903202647","DocDate":"30-APR-1971"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Spain"}},"facets":{}}
