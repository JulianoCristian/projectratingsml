The project will finance three major components over the July 1996 to March 2001 period: 1) a civil works program focusing on maintenance, and including the rehabilitation of sections of the roads branch and labor construction unit network, and selected upgrading of selected priority roads; 2) design engineering and supervision services in support of the program; and 3) sector institutional reform and capacity building, including logistical support to the Ministry of Works."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Lesotho!$!LS","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":76},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":24},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LS","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,78","mjthemecode":"10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":76},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":24}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20060315091054","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060315091054","DocDate":"25-JAN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040617175943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040617175943","DocDate":"25-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121282024","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121282024","DocURL":"16-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121282024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121282024","DocDate":"16-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029224708","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029224708","DocDate":"10-APR-1996"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Lesotho"}},"facets":{}}
