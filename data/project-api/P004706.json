The credit component of the project would support BAAC's lending program for three specified categories (on-farm development, shrimp culture and oil palm development), as well as unspecified categories, which would be identified and appraised by BAAC during project implementation. The total lending program would finance subprojects throughout Thailand, but with not less than half the funds onlent to small farmers; about 9,000 farm families would increase their production and incomes as a result of borrowing through BAAC's expanded lending operations. The technical assistance component of the project would finance programs for training cooperative managers and staff, assisting and restructuring financially weak cooperatives, and improving the cooperative auditing system. In addition, the proposed project would provide technical assistance for several studies and for strengthening BAAC in the areas of planning, credit, financial management and training. The main project risks center on failure to achieve projected yields or an unfavorable relationship developing between production."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"19,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924225516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924225516","DocDate":"30-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9612f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9612f_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902343936","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902343936","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912474786","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912474786","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
