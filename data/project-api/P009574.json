The project's objectives are 1) to increase the number of graduates from basic education and provide enough entrants to existing training programs to fill labor demands; 2) to raise levels of learning; and 3) to strengthen the quality of management within the education sector. The project has four components. 1) Increasing and upgrading facilities for basic education by constructing new schools, substantially upgrading existing schools, and supporting decentralized construction; 2) expanding and improving teacher education; revising curriculum; and supporting central, district, and school-based in-service teacher-training programs; 3) improving learning processes by curriculum development, examining learning processes, revising existing examinations and introducing standardized tests, and developing resource centers, school networks, and the supplementary reading program; and 4) strengthening educational management and administration by further strengthening the professional skills of central staff and developing the capacity to introduce a decentralized school monitoring and supervisory system; strengthening district educational administration; and strengthening school level management through networks and headteacher training."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Bhutan!$!BT","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":76},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"13,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BT","sectorcode":"EV,BH,ET,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"26,78,87,65","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,6,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":76},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8},{"Name":"Education","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Education","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060404091606","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060404091606","DocDate":"31-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123480556","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123480556","DocURL":"27-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052009321586","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052009321586","DocDate":"27-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980312102450","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980312102450","DocDate":"03-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929094703","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929094703","DocDate":"31-JUL-1997"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Bhutan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
