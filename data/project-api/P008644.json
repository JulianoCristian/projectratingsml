The credit line would be channeled through participating financial intermediaries to support investment and rehabilitation programs of textile enterprises for strengthening their productivity and competitiveness. It also seeks to enhance the ongoing efforts at strengthening appraisal and support capacities of financial intermediaries and technical assistance institutions by upgrading their textile expertise. The project faces moderate risks associated with possible slow utilization of the credit line and lower than expected returns from the enterprise-specific restructuring programs. Appropriate incentives have been introduced to maintain the interest of the participating financial institutions and as well as measures to strengthen the appraisal and support capacities of the financial and technical institutions serving the textile sector. A special incentive has been provided under the project to facilitate the use of expert services in preparation of economically and financially viable investment programs for the beneficiary textile enterprises."},"country_namecode":"Portuguese Republic!$!PT","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Industrial restructuring","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"34,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Industrial restructuring"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PT","sectorcode":"IR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industrial restructuring","code":"IR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925203455","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925203455","DocDate":"06-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99d2d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99d2d_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190244283","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190244283","DocDate":"30-APR-1984"}],"countryname":"Portuguese Republic"}},"facets":{}}
