P7512), which focus on improving transparency and accountability in public financial management; strengthening the tracking of poverty-reducing public expenditures and monitoring their impact; improving the strategic priority setting and transparency of public expenditures; and promoting private sector development. In line with these objectives, the Credit has the twin goals of providing assistance in the design and implementation of the Government's reform program, and of helping to build up the institutional capacity and skills to carry out these programs. The Credit has four components: 1) enhancing accountability in public financial management by supporting effective institutional arrangements for implementing the public procurement law; and assisting in designing and developing an institutional capacity for the Chamber of Accounts; 2) strengthening public expenditure management by automating the treasury system; 3) reforming social expenditures by reviewing health expenditures, strengthening the effectiveness of educational expenditures, defining an effective safety net strategy, building the capacity of the State Statistical Office, and providing pre-layoff assistance to workers; and 4) promoting privatization and private sector development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Azerbaijan!$!AZ","sector1":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"9,450,000","sector":[{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"General finance sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Board Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"AZ","sectorcode":"FZ,FA,BZ,BG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"30,43,25,34","mjthemecode":"3,2,4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":25},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20101214002324","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101214002324","DocDate":"21-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20060907162836","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060907162836","DocDate":"14-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000090341_20060315093823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060315093823","DocDate":"14-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201301619","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201301619","DocURL":"17-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201301619","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201301619","DocDate":"17-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99082605312511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99082605312511","DocDate":"28-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02061304013222","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02061304013222","DocDate":"22-MAY-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Azerbaijan"}},"facets":{}}
