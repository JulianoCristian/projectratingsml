The closing date for the project will be extended from June 30, 2012 until April 30, 2013. Project implementation has been progressing well towards achieving the Project Development Objectives (PDO) and is satisfactory. The closing date extension is necessary to allow sufficient time for all remaining activities to be completed and for the PDO to be fully met. This mainly involves operationalizing the systems yet to be deployed. MOLSA has had great success the past few months with the first step. The SSN information system has now become a critical piece of the Ministry's Social Safety Net (SSN) strategy, allowing it to capture beneficiaries and to use the system to improve service delivery. As such, the project will need more time to complete activities that will ensure that the system is fully operational, through acquisition of remaining required equipment, training, and software maintenance services. This will be the third and final extension of the closing date. The closing date has previously been extended twice, from September 30, 2007 to June 30, 2011 and again to June 30, 2012."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Iraq!$!IQ","sector1":{"Name":"Compulsory
