The project has been designed with two geographical components: one for the six northwestern provinces and the three Cuyo provinces, and another for the seven participating littoral provinces.  A third component is designed to strengthen the administrative and technical capacity to coordinate the implementation of the project.  The operation will be implemented in two phases: 1) a protection phase of 12 months for the northwestern provinces, which includes acquiring of goods and execution of works for emergency river flood control; and b) a rehabilitation phase for both geographic regions, which includes transport infrastructure, drainage systems, education and health facilities.  In addition, there is a capacity-building subcomponent for the northwestern provinces to manage flood emergencies and a small scale housing subcomponent for housing reconstruction."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":44},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":44},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":7},"sector4":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":4},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"42,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Housing construction"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"BC,YC,BH,TZ,WZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,39,52,85","mjthemecode":"11,6,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":44},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":44},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":4},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050701135007","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050701135007","DocDate":"29-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201384680","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201384680","DocURL":"06-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201384680","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201384680","DocDate":"06-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3980217140924","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980217140924","DocDate":"23-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929100818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929100818","DocDate":"06-NOV-1997"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
