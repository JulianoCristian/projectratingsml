The project will have a positive impact on broad-based economic growth in focus rural areas, by increasing the demand for output from the rural non-farm sector and from multipliers in farmers' expenditure. On the institution front, project support for the restructuring of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI) will help develop the basis for a strong policy, regulatory, and support framework for the agriculture sector. Overall, these benefits will contribute to the Bank's rural poverty reduction goals and to implementation of the alternative livelihoods program. They will also provide a key element of a counter-narcotics strategy, by fostering an alternative to poppies, and by stimulating rural incomes through support to small-scale farmers, and through expansion of the rural non-farm sector."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government
