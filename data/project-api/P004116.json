The technical assistance and training component will enable SMIPC to expand its activities of assisting private enterprises to all SMI subsectors.  These activities include upgrading skills and improving the productivity of SMIs in using existing and new technology at the plant level. This component of the project will also support overseas training of selected SMIPC and SMI staff.  The credit component of the loan will help cover the foreign exchange requirements of subprojects financed by SMIB and CNB from mid-1985 to mid-1987 and will support the continued institutional development of SMIB and CNB.  The project will also promote the development of improved subcontracting policies, which is important to SMI development in Korea where large companies have the potential to play a major role in assisting smaller firms."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"111,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"IL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","code":"IL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925124950","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925124950","DocDate":"25-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925220127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925220127","DocDate":"25-JAN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702140053","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702140053","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101358","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101358","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
