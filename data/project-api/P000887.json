To achieve these objectives, the project comprises two components: (i) a line of credit to be made available for onlending, through elegible banks, to rural sector borrowers; and (ii) institution building comprising technical assistance for the restructuring of about 80 Rural Banks, the strengthening of the ARB and the CUA, rationalizing the roles of the Rural Banking Department and the ARB, improving rural credit appraisal capacity, and strengthening rural cooperatives. A Rural Finance Department will be created to implement the project and to serve as a nucleus of permanent institutional arrangement for implementing future rural finance projects."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019114345","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019114345","DocDate":"14-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120493997","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120493997","DocURL":"28-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120494098","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120494098","DocDate":"28-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120493596","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120493596","DocDate":"28-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120493295","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120493295","DocURL":"28-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120493596","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120493596","DocURL":"28-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120494098","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120494098","DocURL":"28-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120493997","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120493997","DocDate":"28-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120493295","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120493295","DocDate":"28-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e0804a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0804a_1_0","DocDate":"14-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08048_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08048_1_0","DocDate":"14-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927221903","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927221903","DocDate":"19-APR-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
