There are three project components.  Component 1A provides support for the further development of small rural  businesses and agro-processors through: (a) enhanced rural financial services such as credit for working capital requirements, long-term credit for investment, and leasing programs for processing and agricultural equipment; and (b) promotion of rural business linkages through a program of small grants provided on a competitive basis to introduce and demonstrate business and technological innovations that could improve market access and links between producers and processors. Component 1B assists emerging rural business entities to introduce innovative business mechanisms and improve market linkages, and to demonstrate such improvements to a broader audience of rural entrepreneurs. The project will award small grants under a Competitive Grants Program. Goals of this sub-component are to: (1) accelerate the transfer of improved technologies and business practices to others; (2) build capacity of rural service providers to support rural entrepreneurs; (3) assist small rural businesses to take advantage of economic opportunities; and (4) help the Ministry of Agriculture establish more public-private linkages for reaching farmers and rural businesses.
