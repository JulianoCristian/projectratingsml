This wil be achieved through four project components. Component 1 improves teaching and learning by financing school-based professional development for teachers, providing career development opportunities; upgrading basic education conditions in schools, and ensuring access of rural students to basic teaching-learning materials. Component 2 improves school-community partnerships by setting up a school-community grants program. Component 3 strengthens the analytic capacity of the Ministry of Education and Research (MER) at national and local levels for policy analysis and formulation, as well as for planning and evaluation. Specifically, it establishes the National Education Indicators Set (NEI); improves the National Education Database (NED); and prepares a National Assessment of Basic Education. Component 4 strengthens project management capacity; its activities include forming an information, education, and communication strategy for increasing awareness of policy and decisionmakers and generating stakeholders' support. The project will support a broader community involvement in education management, working not only with education authorities, but also with the local councils, parents, and representatives of communities."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"BZ,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,66,65,78","mjthemecode":"10,8,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":45},{"Name":"Education","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000350881_20100401125015","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20100401125015","DocDate":"04-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03042404004823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03042404004823","DocDate":"04-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02062004091123","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02062004091123","DocDate":"17-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02071104014991","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071104014991","DocDate":"17-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03020504014849","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03020504014849","DocDate":"14-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052712050773","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052712050773","DocDate":"12-SEP-2001"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
