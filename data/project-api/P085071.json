In addition, the project would be a key factor in facilitating Vietnam's accession to the World Trade Organization and securing the gains from greater integration into the world trading system. The project is expected to meet these objectives by: (1) introducing modern Customs systems and procedures based on internationally agreed standards and best practice; (2) improving the organizational structure and strengthening the human, financial and physical resource capacity o f the Customs Department; and (3) introducing appropriate information and communication technology to improve effectiveness, increase transparency, and lower transaction costs. The project provides consulting services, training, technical assistance and appropriate infrastructure to support three key operational components, and one support component: Component one deals with the core technical systems, and procedural aspects of the reform program. Component two improves the organizational and resource management of the new systems. Component three provides the information and communication technology (ICT) support to achieve world class standards of performance in Customs administration. Component four provides the technical and managerial support required to achieve effective implementation and long term sustainability of project objectives."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic
