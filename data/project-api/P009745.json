The project will strengthen and reorient research at SAU and strengthen ICAR's ability to support, guide, coordinate and monitor agricultural research at the state level. The project will focus on research on higher yielding, more disease and pest resistant varieties of grain and oilseed crops, and on improved cropping patterns and agronomic practices, particularly for rainfed areas. Research results will benefit both large and small farmers living in the different ecological regions within participating states."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"27,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Research"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Research","code":"AR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924182629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924182629","DocDate":"15-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd017_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd017_1_0","DocDate":"10-OCT-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd015_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd015_1_0","DocDate":"10-OCT-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902313452","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902313452","DocDate":"30-SEP-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912401891","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912401891","DocDate":"30-SEP-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
