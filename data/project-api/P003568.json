In order to improve TMG's overall infrastructure planning and management, the project will support technical assistance and training to improve techniques and procedures for project planning and evaluation, budgeting and management, and monitoring of urban development and infrastructure operations.  The project will also support technical assistance and training for improvement in sub-sectoral management, including solid waste disposal and public transport management.  The project will support physical works to improve drainage, sewerage, solid waste management, roads, traffic management, and public bus operations.  These works not only command high priorities on their own merits but also complement and hence increase the efficiency of existing assets.  As a sustainable, market-oriented mechanism for industrial pollution control, a line of credit for pollution control investments will be provided under the project to help industrial enterprises undertake waste minimization or other cost-effective pollution reduction measures."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
