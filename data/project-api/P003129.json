The pilot would consist of : 1) strengthened management of extension services, 2) training of extension staff, 3) adaptive research, 4) the establishment of monitoring and evaluation units, and 5) studies. The benefits of this project would include: increased farmer income and productivity, increased agricultural production and domestic food supplies, and improved efficiency of field extension services. The project is expected to cover half a million farm families, or 15 % of the total farming population of Zaire. It will also have a critical impact on the environment, and on farm women."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of the Congo!$!ZR","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"5,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ZR","sectorcode":"AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development"],"themecode":"78","mjthemecode":"10,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019120011","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019120011","DocDate":"19-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120541206","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120541206","DocDate":"15-MAR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120541206","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120541206","DocURL":"15-MAR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e084a4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e084a4_1_0","DocDate":"27-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928124027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928124027","DocDate":"26-JAN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928123845","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928123845","DocDate":"26-JAN-1990"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"}},"facets":{}}
