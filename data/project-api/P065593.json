The project consists of two main components. The first component, which is made up of two sub-components, is to strengthen the capacity of MOE. 1) The first sub-component will support the preparation and evaluation of Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AWPB) to operationalize the priorities of the Five-Year Plan. The second sub-component will cover the costs associated with improved management of financial and procurement systems to implement Trust Fund Credit-funded activities, and the hiring of external expertise to support and mentor MOE staff. 2) The second main component, Targeted Interventions, will support the implementation of activities in the Five-Year Plan and AWPB. The subcomponents under this component include the extension of a program for school improvement, the development of professional standards for headteachers, supporting the MOE to develop and pilot the curriculum and materials for secondary vocational stream, and establishing pilot units for vocational secondary classrooms and workshops attached to existing general secondary schools."},"country_namecode":"West Bank and Gaza!$!GZ","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":24},"sector3":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"7,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GZ","sectorcode":"EV,ES,BC,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"65,61,51","mjthemecode":"6,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":42},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":24},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20061218095654","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061218095654","DocDate":"30-NOV-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050412034620","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050412034620","DocDate":"18-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0105170403532","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0105170403532","DocDate":"03-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00042005515615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00042005515615","DocDate":"04-APR-2000"}],"countryname":"West Bank and Gaza"}},"facets":{}}
