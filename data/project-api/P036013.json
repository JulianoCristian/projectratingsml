The project supports a set of policy measures that are embodied in the new Railway Law, the Restructuring Action Plan (RAP), and the performance contract between SNCFR and the government. The project will only finance investments, which would be required even under pessimistic traffic assumptions and would be in line with the restructuring objectives. They are: 1) track renewal and maintenance on priority routes; 2) integrated railway information system (IRIS); 3) telecommunications and signalling; 4) environmental improvement; 5) traction and depots improvements; 6) rehabilitation of passenger coaches and freight wagons; and 7) technical services."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,27","mjthemecode":"2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20050707134541","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050707134541","DocDate":"21-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040513130454","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040513130454","DocDate":"11-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200223027","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200223027","DocURL":"19-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200222926","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200222926","DocDate":"19-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200222624","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200222624","DocDate":"19-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200222423","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200222423","DocURL":"19-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200222624","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200222624","DocURL":"19-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200222725","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200222725","DocURL":"19-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200222725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200222725","DocDate":"19-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200223027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200223027","DocDate":"19-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200222423","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200222423","DocDate":"19-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacba7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacba7_1_0","DocDate":"18-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081eacba6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacba6_1_0","DocDate":"18-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019101413","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019101413","DocDate":"15-DEC-1995"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
