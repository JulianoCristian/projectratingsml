It will focus on (a) increasing extension coverage from the present 25 percent to about 50 percent of the total number of farmers, through a better organization of field services; (b) extending simple crop husbandry improvements and better means of using available modern inputs; and (c) improving linkages between research and extension to ensure a continuous flow of technologies well adapted to local needs and constraints. To accomplish these objectives, the project will support:  (a) the modification of the agencies' extension services; regular continuous training of extension staff at all levels; and strengthening of linkages between research and extension.  It will further (b) encourage the development of effective monitoring and evaluation and management information systems in each agency and the improvement of their financial management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire!$!CI","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"34,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CI","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006164858","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006164858","DocDate":"07-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092357","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092357","DocDate":"31-OCT-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire"}},"facets":{}}
