The two changes are: (i) extension of the closing date from the original closing date of June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2013 to align with the closing date of the Additional Financing (AF) approved on May 4, 2010; and (ii) amendment of the Development Grant Agreement (DGA) dated June 30, 2004 to include 'costs of transportation and distribution of textbooks' under 'operating costs' to cover unforeseen genuine and eligible expenditures that support project development outcome.
