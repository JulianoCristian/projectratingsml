The ERSG III operation directly follows on Second Economic Reform Support Grant (ERSG II) and will support the government to continue: (i) reforms in the public finance management system to improve accountability and transparency in public spending; (ii) reforms in the business, legal, and institutional environment to foster private sector-led growth; and (iii) reforms in the coffee and domestic petroleum sub-sectors. The program structure aims to maintain a balance between the need for essential reforms and the simplicity dictated by the weak institutions and implementation capacity. This balance is maintained with a particular bias toward deepening the reform process in areas already supported by predecessor operations, where government's buy-in has already been established. Overall, the program continues to support the establishment of new legal and institutional frameworks to implement essential reforms. Given the current limits of fiscal space, it was also designed to help the government to maintain adequate financial resources through: (a) economic growth, (b) external financial assistance, and (iii) debt relief. At the conclusion of the ERSG II-III programmatic series, tangible progress with respect to each component of the reform program is expected, including: 1) measurable improvements in public finance management; 2) measurable improvements in the environment for private sector development; and 3) progress in the execution of the reform program in the coffee and domestic petroleum sub-sectors."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Burundi!$!BI","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":6},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":12},"theme3":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":6},"theme4":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":6},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":70},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document","countrycode":"BI","sectorcode":"JB,AZ,JA,EZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Rural development","Rule of law","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,28,32,77,34","mjthemecode":"3,10,3,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20110801010446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110801010446","DocDate":"06-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2010122111252314","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010122111252314","DocDate":"16-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2010120715310786","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010120715310786","DocDate":"23-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010081614220690","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010081614220690","DocDate":"19-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20091008235825","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091008235825","DocDate":"30-SEP-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Burundi"}},"facets":{}}
