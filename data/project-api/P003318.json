The project has three components. The first component reinforces institutional and organizational capacity to sustain investments and effectively manage the Parks estate and wildlife resources: it supports organizational development, implements Fund financial management and management information systems, institutes comprehensive park planning, improves capacity for policy development, supports monitoring and applied research for protected area management and biodiversity conservation, and provides interpretative and educational materials and programs. The second component improves elements of national park infrastructure needed to manage parks for wildlife and habitat conservation and for sustainable commercial development, including improving infrastructure critical for park functioning and tourism access, providing plant and equipment for road maintenance, improving and adding staff housing, and providing vehicles and other equipment for improved park management and anti-poaching operations. The third component strengthens biodiversity conservation in the national park and nearby areas; implements the park management plan; establishes a consultative process in park planning, management, and conservation; supports community-based sub-projects; and supports educational programs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zimbabwe!$!ZW","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":24},"sector2":{"Name":"General information and communications sector","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Power","Percent":23},"sector4":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":23},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"62,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"General information and communications sector"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"ZW","sectorcode":"BC,TA,LD,CZ,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"45,78,82,80","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11,10,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"General information and communications sector","code":"CZ"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":24},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":23},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":23},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":23},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000012009_20040415105839","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040415105839","DocDate":"31-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903282726","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903282726","DocDate":"21-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031110124229","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031110124229","DocDate":"25-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052611171230","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052611171230","DocDate":"25-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980624142700","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624142700","DocDate":"30-APR-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zimbabwe","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
