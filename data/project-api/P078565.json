It includes: (1) improving the efficiency of  budget expenditure by de-concentrating expenditures and accountability to enable greater flexibility to regional administrations, and by introducing performance budgeting and auditing; (2) implementing a reform of the civil service based on enhancing efficiency and service quality; and (3) ensuring a sustainable macroframework, by controlling, among other things, the magnitude of  the civil service payroll. Based on an agreed set of  public administration reforms, the Bank will provide resources to the Government. The loan will be the first in a series of annual programmatic loans supporting the implementation of the reform program. The loan will complement and strengthen the ongoing multi-year Economic and Sector Work (ESW) activity through which the Bank is providing the Government with advice, training, and technical assistance as required in the areas of budgetary management and civil service."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Information Document,Program Document,Program Document,Program Information Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,25","mjthemecode":"2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090814011024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090814011024","DocDate":"25-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050816092812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050816092812","DocDate":"30-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010041609575847","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010041609575847","DocDate":"12-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000160016_20040614153355","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040614153355","DocDate":"10-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050304161135","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050304161135","DocDate":"04-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20040615131233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040615131233","DocDate":"04-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20040526154451","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040526154451","DocDate":"03-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03062104090743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03062104090743","DocDate":"05-JUN-2003"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
