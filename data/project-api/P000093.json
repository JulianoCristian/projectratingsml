In addition, the project aims at strengthening sector institutions, improving road maintenance, limiting new road construction to economically justified sections, and improving cost recovery and maintenance funding. To reach these objectives, the project consists of four components including: (a) a port rehabilitation program; (b) a road maintenance and rehabilitation program; (c) an institution-strengthening program; and (d) a cost recovery program. The principal benefits expected from the project will be protection of previous investment in the sector, reduced transport costs and increased efficiency of transport sector institutions."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"19,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019213944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019213944","DocDate":"28-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e368e9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e368e9_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e368e7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e368e7_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092522","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092522","DocDate":"30-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333037_20100423015011","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100423015011","DocDate":"30-APR-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin"}},"facets":{}}
