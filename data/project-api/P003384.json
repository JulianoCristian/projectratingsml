The Gas Development and Utilization Project, which corresponds to Phase I of Burma's Payagon Gas Development Program (PGDP), supports:  (a) the establishment of a sound gas pricing policy based on full cost recovery as a minimum; (b) drilling and completion of production wells, as well as installation of surface facilities, and gas transmission and distribution pipelines for Rangoon.  Further to this, the project involves (c) appraisal of additional reserves for Phase II of the PGDP; (d) gas subsector investment planning; (e) oil reservoir and production studies to evaluate options for increasing domestic oil production; and (f) introduction of modern petroleum engineering practices, technical assistance and training."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar!$!MM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"63,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MM","sectorcode":"GS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","code":"GS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019114742","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019114742","DocDate":"20-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120310805","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120310805","DocURL":"13-OCT-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36c91_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36c91_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091855","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091855","DocDate":"30-JUN-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar"}},"facets":{}}
