The urban transport component would provide transport infrastructure (expansion of the high-speed express bus network, construction of primary roads in the low-income Banco area, pedestrian facilities, bus terminals and a bus depot), traffic management measures and programs to improve circulation (road maintenance, junction improvements, traffic signals, etc.), technical assistance in road safety, public transport management and traffic management, and training of traffic engineers. The secondary cities component would, on an experimental basis and on a limited scale, provide Daloa and Korhogo with urban infrastructure, equipment and materials to improve delivery of municipal services, and technical assistance to the municipalities and the central Government to improve municipal management and to carry out an investment programming study for secondary cities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire!$!CI","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"51,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CI","sectorcode":"UM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban management","code":"UM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925064328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925064328","DocDate":"08-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902381262","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902381262","DocDate":"31-AUG-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912522681","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912522681","DocDate":"31-JUL-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire"}},"facets":{}}
