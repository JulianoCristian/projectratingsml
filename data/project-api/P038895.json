The changes include: (1) revision of project scope, targets, and result indicators, including cancelling of some water resources activities and works; (2) revision of project costs related to the 3-year additional financing (AF) period from US$200 million to US$ 72.5 million, cancellation of US$23 million from the AF loan amount, and increase in the disbursement percentage to 100 percent. The main reasons for these changes are: (1) delays in start up and implementation AF Loan financed activities; and (2) ensuring that results indicators are in line with the restructured project, measurable within the timeframe for project completion, and in line with the activities being supported by the project."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of
