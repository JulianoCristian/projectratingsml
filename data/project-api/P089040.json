Under component one, the following activities were scaled down including: 1) procurement and installation of lab facilities in the partner universities and; 2) completion of construction of university infrastructure. Under component two, scaled down activities included: a) development of Higher Education Information Management System (HEMIS) and; b) scaling down of training programs at the university level and MOHE staff with management training. In each of these instances, these activities were completed for most, but not all of the intended beneficiaries. As a result, US $4.55 million will not be utilized before the closing date of June 30th, 2013. The Government has officially requested the cancellation of this amount in order that these funds can be recommitted to other projects within the Afghanistan portfolio. The remaining US $8.19 million has been contracted and all work related to these expenses will be completed by June 30th and the total amount will be disbursed before the end of the project's grace period (ending October 31st, 2013)."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
