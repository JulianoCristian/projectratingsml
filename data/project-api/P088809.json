The restructuring aims to respond to the evolving Borrower's needs and priorities in the area of fiscal decentralization. The project has suffered significant implementation delays, due in part to the change in administration shortly after the project was approved, and specifically to the process of adjusting the project activities to the priorities of the new administration."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Capacidad institucional para la descentralizaci\u00f3n fiscal sostenible (Pr\u00e9stamo de asistencia t\u00e9cnica \u2013 TAL, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s)</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"8,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Procurement Plan,Project Paper,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"BC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,24,27","mjthemecode":"2,1,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":80},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20111121224241","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20111121224241","DocDate":"21-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20101019232643","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101019232643","DocDate":"08-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20101019232309","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101019232309","DocDate":"07-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000334955_20100827051633","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100827051633","DocDate":"01-JAN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000334955_20090703012454","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090703012454","DocDate":"23-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010041615462298","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010041615462298","DocDate":"16-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20040628110649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040628110649","DocDate":"18-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000012009_20040526152404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040526152404","DocDate":"04-MAY-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
