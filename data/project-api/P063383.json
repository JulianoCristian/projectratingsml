The project has three main components. Component 1 encompasses the following five sub-components which improve OSE's responsiveness to its customers: internal benchmarking, decentralization, modernization of management, environmental capacity building, and strategy development for service provision. Component 2 has three sub-components: 1) the expansion and rehabilitation of a treatment plant, which enhances the sustainability of Montevideo's water supply; 2) the Unaccounted-for Water (UFW) Reduction Program which increases the sustainability of water supply investments in the interior; and 3) the Small Town Water Supply Program which extends coverage to beneficiaries who do not currently have piped water. Component 3 supports expansions in sewage collection and increases in treatment under three sub-components: 1) a national sanitation master plan which reviews existing arrangements for financing, operating, and prioritizing sanitation investments; 2) a sewerage extensions program which helps OSE to pilot a new demand-responsive approach to expanding existing systems that improves investment targeting and cost-recovery; and 3) a sub-component providing investment financing to increase appropriate sewage treatment and disposal in the interior."},"country_namecode":"Oriental Republic of
