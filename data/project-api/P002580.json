The project would include the following elements: (a) addition of the fifth and sixth hydro-units (80 MW) at the existing Roseires hydroelectric facility plus embedded parts of unit seven; (b) reinforcement of the 33 kV transmission circuits between Burri and Khartoum North substations; (c) extention to Kartoum North substation; (d) engineering and site supervision; (e) management and staff training, (f) stringing of the second 220-kV transmission circuit between Sennar junction and the Kilo X substation in Khartoum; (g) installation of about 40 MW diesel generating capacity of Burri power station; (h) installation of the first and second units (2 x 30 MW) at the Khartoum North steam power plant. The physical risks of the project are negligible. Other risks associated with managerial/administrative capacity would be mitigated by the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Sudan!$!SD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"65,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"SD","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925183700","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925183700","DocDate":"19-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04199_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04199_1_0","DocDate":"17-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04196_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04196_1_0","DocDate":"17-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902345367","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902345367","DocDate":"31-MAR-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Sudan"}},"facets":{}}
