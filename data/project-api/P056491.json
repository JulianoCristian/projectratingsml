The project's primary objective is to assist in the restoration of economic and social activities following an earthquake in Zhangjiakou Municipality in northwest Hebei province, by restoring social and economic infrastructure and priority production facilities. A second objective is to strengthen the socioeconomic situation in the area through enhancing productive activities, which would alleviate the extreme poverty. The project supports emergency reconstruction, repair, and rehabilitation (and for some components, equipment purchases) of housing; schools; health care facilities; grain storage facilities; drinking water facilities--including distribution networks; water conservancy facilities--a reservoir, wells, buildings, canals, bridges, aqueducts, etc.; and irrigation works--shallow stone wells, dug wells, tube wells, and small sprinkler irrigation systems. An added component provides technical assistance, training, and support to municipal, county, and township level agencies, particularly for building standard development, project management, and monitoring."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
