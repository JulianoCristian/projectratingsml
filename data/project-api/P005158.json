The project's main objective is to reinforce prospects of success of the reforms to be undertaken by the economic reform and structural adjustment program (ERSAP).  In line with this objective, the project will support six core programs : 1) the provision of essential municipal services; 2) improvements to essential public transport services; 3) a community development program including improvements in basic and primary health care provision, immunization programs, and mother and child nutrition programs; 4) an enterprise development program; 5) a labor mobility program; and 6) an institutional development program."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":18},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"140,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"BC,JB,FE,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,53,59,57,41","mjthemecode":"4,7,7,6,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":57},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":18},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":14},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121555132","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121555132","DocURL":"26-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121555132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121555132","DocDate":"26-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e39312_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e39312_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001083605","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001083605","DocDate":"29-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001083147","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001083147","DocDate":"29-MAY-1991"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
