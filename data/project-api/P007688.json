The project consists of three components: investment; environmental and archeological site protection; and (c) institutional development. The investment component will finance programs for infrastructure projects (rural roads and rural electrification), productive projects (agriculture, forestry and agroindustries), and social projects (education, water supply and sewerage systems). The environmental preservation and archeological protection component will finance a program (the Lacandona Protection Plan) which will: (a) protect the last remaining humid forest area in Mexico; (b) strengthen the institutional capacity of federal offices, state agencies, and municipalities in order to improve project assessment techniques and environmental policy implementation; and (c) finance the restoration of selected archeological sites. The institutional development component will finance costs for strenghtening: (a) project executing agencies; (b) state and municipal planning and budgeting systems; and (c) the state and municipal entities to assume additional administrative functions that they have and will be receiving under the government's program of decentralization."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Power","Percent":7},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":28},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"350,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BH,EZ,LD,TA,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Rural development","Rural development","Human development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,65,78,75,73","mjthemecode":"9,10,10,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":30},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":7},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625093728","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625093728","DocDate":"31-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122441960","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122441960","DocURL":"26-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122441960","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122441960","DocDate":"26-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929140024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929140024","DocDate":"04-MAR-1991"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
