There will be no change to the ongoing project activities. Most of the remaining funds have been committed, with a large number of contracts ongoing, and it will be important to complete ongoing activities as planned in order to achieve the original project development objective. The new component, to be implemented in parallel with the original components, will also be implemented by the Department of Amelioration Scheme Management (DASM) through its fully staffed Project Technical Unit (PTU) that has sufficient technical and fiduciary capacity."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"27,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Paper,Project Paper,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GE","sectorcode":"BC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"33,78,85,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,10,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":55},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20100330230738","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100330230738","DocDate":"27-JAN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010022412533155","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010022412533155","DocDate":"27-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2006012611425960","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006012611425960","DocDate":"27-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010022412533155","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010022412533155","DocURL":"27-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2006012611425960","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006012611425960","DocURL":"27-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000160016_20050705103506","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050705103506","DocDate":"27-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000090341_20050614101728","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050614101728","DocDate":"06-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201234831","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201234831","DocURL":"05-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060704034847","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060704034847","DocDate":"25-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01030205432594","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01030205432594","DocDate":"26-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911074110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911074110","DocDate":"31-JAN-1999"}],"countryname":"Georgia"}},"facets":{}}
