There are two components to the project. The first component of the project is National Trade Corridor (NTC). This component includes studies and technical assistance for analytical work to underpin key reforms, help assess and design prospective investments and build capacity to implement the Government's NTCIP in the following sub-sectors: ports, railways, road freight industry, highways, air transport, energy logistics, and other transport logistics. The second component of the project is Trade and Transport Facilitation (TTF). This component builds on the results achieved by the first trade and transport facilitation project closed in 2006, extending efforts to streamline and integrate trade data exchange and official controls, sustain public/private sector collaborative institutional framework and strengthen the domestic logistic industry."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of
