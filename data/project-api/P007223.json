The project seeks to raise coverage and equity, the first component, through increased pre-primary and primary school enrollment in the poorest rural areas, emphasizing reaching indigenous groups and girls by (a) expanding the National Community-managed Program for Educational Development; (b) offering afternoon shifts in existing schools; and (c) expanding the \"Programa de la Nina.\" The second component seeks to improve efficiency and quality of rural basic education, resulting in reduced drop-out and repetition rates, and improved student academic achievement, mainly by supporting bilingual and multigrade teaching methodologies. The third component seeks to strengthen the organization and management of the education ministry's normative and policymaking functions at the central level, and support functions at the intermediate and local levels, with community involvement in day-to-day school organization and management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guatemala!$!GT","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"GT","sectorcode":"ET,BH,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"60,65,78,59,71","mjthemecode":"9,7,10,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":55},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13},{"Name":"Education","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040519133820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040519133820","DocDate":"17-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123140233","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123140233","DocURL":"20-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123140032","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123140032","DocDate":"20-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123135931","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123135931","DocURL":"20-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123140233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123140233","DocDate":"20-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123135931","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123135931","DocDate":"20-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185250","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185250","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101803","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101803","DocDate":"30-APR-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guatemala"}},"facets":{}}
