The project has three components. The first finances small hydro investments by the private sector in, for example, canal-based and dam toe (sic) schemes, run-of-river schemes, rehabilitation and/or upgrading of old plants, use of tail ends of cooling water systems of thermal power plants, and stand-alone micro-hydro schemes. The project designs rural energy initiatives that feature partnerships between private investors and user communities. The second component helps design, develop, and implement integrated energy management services operated by service companies and end-users on a performance guarantee basis; purchases and installs energy-efficient and/or load management devices and systems; produces energy-efficient equipment; and encourages end-user participation in the state energy board and other utility-sponsored DSM programs. The third component finances pre-investment activities that develop a sustainable pipeline of energy-efficient investments and standard bidding document preparation; establish in-house capacity within IREDA (the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited) to appraise, supervise, and promote energy efficiency services and schemes; assist in promoting end-use efficiency; and train officials and staff."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"130,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,44,78,81","mjthemecode":"11,10,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20081024005650","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20081024005650","DocDate":"30-SEP-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201144362","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201144362","DocDate":"11-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010043010075766","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010043010075766","DocDate":"11-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201144362","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201144362","DocURL":"11-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201144564","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201144564","DocURL":"11-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201144564","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201144564","DocDate":"11-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040616152965","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040616152965","DocDate":"11-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052611130263","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052611130263","DocDate":"11-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99092312090319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99092312090319","DocDate":"14-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980624142819","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624142819","DocDate":"29-APR-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
