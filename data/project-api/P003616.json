The project consists of:  (i) construction of a pumped-storage hydroelectric power plant together with upper and lower reservoirs, a water conveyance system, an underground powerhouse, and a switchyard; (ii) provision and installation of six 300-MW reversible pump-turbine units and associated equipment; (iii) erection of 500-kV transmission lines and reinforcement of the existing power transmission network; (iv) construction management and engineering services; (iv) studies of optimal power plant operation and its output pricing; and (v) strengthening of the beneficiary's
