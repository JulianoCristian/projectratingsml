There are three components. Component 1 supports a series of legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms to sustain and deepen existing market reforms. It has the following subcomponents: 1) legal and institutional framework support by introducing mechanisms for two key autonomous agencies responsible for formalizing urban property rights (COFOPRI and RPU) to define new issues in the formalization process and develop sustainable solutions; 2) investment promotion by recommending mechanisms to enhance the market use of property rights; and 3) socio-economic monitoring by administering comprehensive household surveys, land value assessments, specific studies, and client surveys. Component 2 strengthens and expands the two national organizations for urban property, by providing technical support to develop appropriate operational infrastructure, administrative manuals, management information systems, computer system audits, and a knowledge management and human resources management strategy. Component 3 supports the conversion of informal urban property in informal settlements to formal and secure property rights by issuing and registering titles. This includes collecting demographic and economic data and financing contractor salaries."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"38,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Brief,Brief,Brief,Brief,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83,33","mjthemecode":"3,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050112101614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050112101614","DocDate":"27-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150217130321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150217130321","DocDate":"03-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333037_20150128003633","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20150128003633","DocDate":"04-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333037_20150128003058","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20150128003058","DocDate":"04-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333037_20150128004519","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20150128004519","DocDate":"04-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200393028","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200393028","DocDate":"04-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200392827","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200392827","DocDate":"04-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200393028","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200393028","DocURL":"04-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200392827","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200392827","DocURL":"04-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200392726","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200392726","DocDate":"04-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980901093233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980901093233","DocDate":"15-JUL-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101751","DocDate":"18-MAY-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
