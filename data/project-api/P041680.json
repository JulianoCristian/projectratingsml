Access will be expanded by establishing a scholarship program for low-income students; building classrooms, and providing furniture and equipment; and expanding current distance education programs. Quality will be improved by developing the curriculum, including providing educational materials, books, laboratory equipment, teacher training, and innovative social formative projects; establishing learning resource centers; rehabilitating schools and equipment; developing a national assessment system; and establishing a national school accreditation and supervision system. Institutional capacity will be built by strengthening and modernizing management at the central and department levels, training local councils and providing local finance as part of the school-based management scheme; and increasing public awareness and support by using communication strategies and waging campaigns. Project administration comprises the last of the four components."},"country_namecode":"Republic of El Salvador!$!SV","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":6},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"58,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"SV","sectorcode":"JB,BH,ET,BC,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Human development","Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,51,78,65,71","mjthemecode":"9,8,10,6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":70},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Education","Percent":6},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060626100441","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060626100441","DocDate":"16-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200333377","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200333377","DocURL":"21-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200333678","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200333678","DocURL":"21-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200333980","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200333980","DocURL":"21-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171114","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171114","DocDate":"07-AUG-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of El Salvador"}},"facets":{}}
