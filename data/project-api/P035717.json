The project will ensure that funds are targeted and reliably transferred to the poorest communities, will promote further decentralization of decision making to State, municipal and local levels. The project comprises three main components: community subprojects, consisting of infrastructure, social and productive or small-scale industrial projects; institutional development providing technical assistance and training in implementing new project schemes;
