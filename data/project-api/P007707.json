The project will have three main components: 1) strengthening of the major federal institutions that play a key role in management of water resources; 2) supporting the investment/operational plans of WUs; and 3) developing the planning and environmental capabilities of the WUs to strengthen them as viable and sustainable institutions."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican
