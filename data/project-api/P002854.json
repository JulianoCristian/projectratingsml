Consisting of four components, the project seeks to establish a new institutional support system to provide promotional and extension services to private enterprises, to be built around: (a) the newly created Centre Togolais des Investisseurs (CTI) and (b) a separate unit within the Chamber of Commerce (DIVA) to be restructured in order to provide a range of extension services to private enterprises. Secondly, the project includes support for the Government's on-going program of privatization of parastatals through (a) a resident technical advisor to the Ministry of State Enterprises and ad hoc consultancy services and (b) advisory services to support the establishment of a mutual investment fund to facilitate the financial participation of Togolese investors in the privatization process. Thirdly, the project entails a pilot scheme for microenterprise lending, in collaboration with NGOs/PVOs and, lastly, (4) a line of credit to finance fixed investments and working capital of existing enterprises as well as new projects."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Togo!$!TG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TG","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029214918","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029214918","DocDate":"30-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042311204612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042311204612","DocDate":"02-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022612061813","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022612061813","DocDate":"30-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042311185211","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042311185211","DocDate":"30-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36ca4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36ca4_1_0","DocDate":"03-SEP-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926074530","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926074530","DocDate":"20-JUL-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Togo"}},"facets":{}}
