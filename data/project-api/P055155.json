This project has 5 components. Component 1 restores the capacity of Azerbaijan to produce sturgeon fingerlings by building a new hatchery; and creates a sustainable institutional and financial basis for future hatchery operations. Component 2 demonstrates mercury cleanup technologies and procedures by decontaminating one heavily polluted area. It tests pilot-scale sludge treatment; develops and applies a low-technology method for mercury recovery; transports wastes; constructs a safe, new landfill; designs and implements a monitoring program for mercury emissions; and does a follow-up assessment. Component 3 tests cleanup methodologies on a pilot basis and mitigates existing pollution in one onshore oil field of the Abseron peninsula. It finances a series of pilot projects to determine the most cost-effective method for treating oil-contaminated sediments and sludge; cleans up oil residues; and continues operating the implementation unit in the state's oil company. Component 4 strengthens the environmental management system by reviewing its legislative and regulatory framework and building the capacity of the State Committee of Ecology. Component 5 consists of project management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Azerbaijan!$!AZ","sector1":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":38},"sector2":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":37},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AZ","sectorcode":"TA,LC,BC,AJ,WZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"25,79,84,82,33","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"3,11,11,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":38},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":37},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":7},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060123112257","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060123112257","DocDate":"29-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929100335","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929100335","DocDate":"05-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000178830_98111703542923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703542923","DocDate":"10-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201003880","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201003880","DocURL":"07-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201003880","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201003880","DocDate":"07-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980709144324","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980709144324","DocDate":"09-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929100251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929100251","DocDate":"20-MAY-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Azerbaijan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
