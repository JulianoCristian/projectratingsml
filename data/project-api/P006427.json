At the state level, the project will:  (a) streamline state education bureaucracies and help them achieve more efficient use of human resources and a more efficient allocation of spending; (b) increase state and municipal materials; (c) improve state and municipal teachers' skills and classroom effectiveness and the leadership skills of school directors; (d) finance a time slice of the states' school rehabilitation and construction programs, conditional upon states' progress in implementing agreed management reforms; and (e) support promising state and municipal education initiatives through matching grants from a small innovations fund.  The project will also have a component at the federal level to strengthen the Ministry of Education's capacity for key oversight and support functions, such as national standardized student testing; planning, policy and norm-setting; and financial transfers to equalize education spending across states.  Finally, the project will support reform of the centralized national textbook and school lunch distribution systems, in order to assure the timely and adequate availability of learning materials in Brazilian primary schools."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary
