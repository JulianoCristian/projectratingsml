The first component - economic development and livelihood diversification in artisanal and small-scale mining areas - will contribute to increased production by artisanal and small-scale miners, in an environmentally and socially sustainable way, achieved through the empowerment of small-scale miners, and surrounding communities that depend directly, or indirectly on the exploitation of solid minerals to ensure their sustainability. Component A will have a demand driven approach, whereby cooperatives and associations of artisanal, small scale miners, and the affected communities will be empowered to take charge of their own development agenda, and define their own needs in the context of business, and community development plans, namely access to credit finance. The second component aims at strengthening governance and transparency in mining, to improve Nigeria's competitiveness, and attract private investments in mining. The activities supported by the Project include: a) Revision and modernization of the legal and fiscal frameworks for mining; b) Institutional capacity building for efficient public mining institutions and transparent management of the sector; c) Development of a computerized registry, and Mining Cadastre system in accordance with international standards; and, d) Development of environmental and social management practices within the mining sector.
