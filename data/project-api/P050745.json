The project aims to significantly reduce the quantity of arsenic ingested; increase access to a sustainable safe water supply; and increase the percentage of treated arsenicosis patients in the project areas. There are three components. The first, on-site mitigation, 1) provides technical assistance, training, and logistical support to build capacity and operate the project management unit (PMU); 2) implements community interventions by developing a community-based organization capable of supplying short-term, alternative water supply/sanitation infrastructure; 3) prepares and implements a technical and financial proposal; and 4) audits, evaluates, and monitors project impact and groundwater quality. The second component strengthens the PMU's capacity to collect, manage, and evaluate data for water quality, arsenic contamination, and socioeconomic conditions; undertakes well screening and community education; and funds studies and research on participatory planning, implementing appropriate technology, cost recovery, appropriate technology for testing and treating arsenic in groundwater, and land use/arsenic interactions. The third component, institutional strengthening, builds capacity in arsenic mitigation and participatory water supply and sanitation."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":24},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"32,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sanitation"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"WA,JB,JA,WC,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,78,82,57,71","mjthemecode":"9,7,11,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":24},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070724113908","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070724113908","DocDate":"10-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201010900","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201010900","DocURL":"21-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201010900","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201010900","DocDate":"21-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980928162444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980928162444","DocDate":"07-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929095158","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929095158","DocDate":"23-JUL-1998"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
