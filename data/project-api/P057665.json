The project has three main components. The first component expands coverage of the government's Family Health Program (Programa de Saude da Familia, or PSF) in about 100 large municipalities, establishing well-articulated referral and counter-referral systems, and introducing performance-based financing and management arrangements. The second component establishes family health as a core element of health professional and para-professional training. The third component strengthens the health ministry's capacity to monitor and evaluate PSF health services, policies, and training activities on a systematic basis."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Programa de extensi\u00f3n de salud familiar</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"68,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Urban development","Public sector governance","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,67,26,71,69","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,9,2,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000386194_20110630014446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110630014446","DocDate":"22-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080410014236","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080410014236","DocDate":"21-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201564342","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201564342","DocURL":"26-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02022804005161","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022804005161","DocDate":"14-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01041305523883","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01041305523883","DocDate":"08-NOV-2001"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
