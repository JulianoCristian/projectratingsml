Under the infrastructure rehabilitation components, the project will support: (i) rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation works and facilities long neglected as a result of the hostilities; and (ii) operation and maintenance of irrigation systems as well as the procurement of irrigation equipment and materials. The institutional support component will include: (a) strengthening of irrigation and water management public institutions; (b) strengthening of basic public agricultural services, such as applied research, extension, quality control of agricultural inputs and produce; and (c) support to Water Authorities and Water User Association in the operation and maintenance of irrigation systems and improving the efficiency of on-farm water use. Cost recovery and cost sharing will be consistent with the National Water Management Strategy currently under preparation."},"country_namecode":"Lebanese Republic!$!LB","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":11},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"57,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LB","sectorcode":"BC,AB,BH,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"77,82,59,85,78","mjthemecode":"10,11,7,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":78},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":6},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040524101233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040524101233","DocDate":"18-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123044781","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123044781","DocURL":"10-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123044982","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123044982","DocDate":"10-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123044781","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123044781","DocDate":"10-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123044982","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123044982","DocURL":"10-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99e60_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99e60_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99e5f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99e5f_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006122904","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006122904","DocDate":"09-JUN-1994"}],"countryname":"Lebanese Republic"}},"facets":{}}
