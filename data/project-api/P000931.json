Emphasis is given to institutional and human resource development and reaching more women farmers. The project includes three components:  (a) strengthening the extension services in all the ten regions through provision of infrastructure, transport, equipment, consultancy services and incremental recurrent cost support on a declining basis and forging a closer link between extension and agricultural research services; (b) strengthening the technical departments of the Ministry of Agriculture to expand sectoral capacity to test the relevance of technologies generated by research institutes to farmers' conditions through provision of transport, equipment, consultancies, and incremental recurrent cost support to subject matter specialists and to project monitoring and evaluation; and (c) supporting human resource development through improved facilities, provision of teaching materials, farm and laboratory equipment, and transport support as well as policy improvements, institutional reforms of agricultural colleges and the provision of text books to the three faculties of agriculture."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":33},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"30,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,78,25","mjthemecode":"2,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":67},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":33}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000094946_01080804021424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01080804021424","DocDate":"22-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00092205320243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00092205320243","DocDate":"30-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121084259","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121084259","DocURL":"22-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121084460","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121084460","DocURL":"22-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121084259","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121084259","DocDate":"22-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121084460","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121084460","DocDate":"22-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e3948d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3948d_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001214613","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001214613","DocDate":"25-FEB-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
