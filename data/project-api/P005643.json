The project will connect about 990 villages in 15 Governorates to the national network and improve the supply of electricity in about 60 towns. The project consists of the following components: (i) supply and erection of about 3,130 km (2,460 km for rural electrification and 670 km for urban distribution) of medium tension and 2,840 km (2,060 km rural, and 780 km urban) of low tension lines; (ii) supply and installation of about 1,290 transformers for a total capacity of 62 MVA (32 MVA rural and 30 MVA urban); (iii) provision of equipment and tools for implementing the urban rehabilitation component; and (iv) provision of technical assistance for training, and a study for strengthening the power distribution system in Tunis. The project, when completed, will extend electricity services to about 30,400 new domestic rural customers, 2,100 pumping stations and 300 commercial and small industrial consumers, and improve the quality of service to more than 150,000 existing urban consumers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"41,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925071929","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925071929","DocDate":"23-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190237445","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190237445","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912532273","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912532273","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
