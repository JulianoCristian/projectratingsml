This paper is to: (i) reallocation of the credit proceeds in order to fully utilize the remaining funding in line with the project development objective (PDO) of improving the capacity of the financial sector regulators and the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs); and (ii) the assignment and assumption of the rights and obligations under the Zoos Bank's Project Agreement with the Bank in favor of the new State Bank of Mongolia reflecting the recent changes in Mongolia's banking sector. In early 2009, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was amended to support the Bank of Mongolia's (BOM) urgent needs related to failed bank resolution and bank restructuring, for a reallocation of US$1 million from the credit line component for the BOM technical assistance sub-component. The closing date for the Project has been extended by one year in April 2010 (until April 30, 2011), to allow for the orderly completion for the ongoing and planned activities towards the achievement of the PDO."},"country_namecode":"Mongolia!$!MN","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance
