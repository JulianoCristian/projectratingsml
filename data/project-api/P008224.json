The project has three specific objectives: 1) to assist in the strengthening of Monagas Water and Sewerage Company (AdM), develop its financial self-sufficiency, and involve the private sector in the management and operation of the company; 2) to rehabilitate and improve the quality of WS&S services in Monagas; and 3) to support sector development and decentralization at the national level, including water resources management. The project will include two components to finance: 1) regional institutional strengthening and investment in rehabilitating the existing WS&S systems in the State of Monagas to improve quality and efficiency of service delivery. This component will consist of: (a) institutional strengthening and support to AdM; (b) rehabilitation in urban areas; and (c) institutional development and rehabilitation of rural water systems; and 2) national institutional strengthening, which will include: (a) a technical assistance program; (b) a national training program; (c) a sector decentralization program; and (d) consulting services."},"country_namecode":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela!$!VE","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":41},"sector2":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":41},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"39,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"VE","sectorcode":"BH,BC,WS,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Urban development","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,26,74,78,57","mjthemecode":"7,10,9,2,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":41},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":41},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03012304092028","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03012304092028","DocDate":"27-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200243809","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200243809","DocURL":"02-OCT-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200244313","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200244313","DocURL":"02-OCT-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200243608","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200243608","DocURL":"02-OCT-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200244111","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200244111","DocURL":"02-OCT-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200244212","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200244212","DocURL":"02-OCT-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029225027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029225027","DocDate":"16-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052516121606","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052516121606","DocDate":"14-APR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela"}},"facets":{}}
