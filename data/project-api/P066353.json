There are five components to the project. Component one: clarifying land tenure. This component will remain intact. That is, it will help secure land rights and develop private and government capacity to survey land and provide titles to interested right holders. Component two and three: enhancing local management capacity and financing of local investments. The component on local participatory planning (enhancement of local management capacity) and the related financing component (local investments) will be combined. Component four: supporting decentralization and project coordination. Activities related to support Cote d'Ivoire's decentralization process will be omitted in the restructured project because this process has been stalled due to crisis. Component five: boosting rice production. In the face of the recent \"food price crisis\" in Cote d'Ivoire, a new component will be added to help vulnerable farm households in the north and west of the country by stimulating rice production."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire!$!CI","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"2,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Telecommunications"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"CI","sectorcode":"CT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"66","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20090821044240","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090821044240","DocDate":"30-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000334955_20100527083712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100527083712","DocDate":"29-JUL-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022613505838","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022613505838","DocDate":"26-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042115472640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042115472640","DocDate":"26-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0006280532366","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0006280532366","DocDate":"01-JUN-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
