There are three main components. The first 1) supports Bappenas transport planning and guides the development of increased regional and provincial autonomy; 2) defines a regional transport strategy, preparing long-term plans, feasibility studies, and other surveys; and 3) improves annual planning/programming in the program area. The second component improves the national, provincial, and Kabupaten road networks, comprising road network maintenance, widening, and rehabilitation; and major capacity expansion and network extension. The third component enhances quality and technical efficiency by setting up consistent contract monitoring and control processes, improving design and construction audit processes, facilitating quality construction, and giving advice on technical and contractual matters. This component also builds the capacity of provincial road traffic and transport agencies, makes selective investments, conducts awareness campaigns, and provides equipment to reduce vehicle overloading."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":7},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"234,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BC,BH,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,84,73","mjthemecode":"9,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20060727102306","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060727102306","DocDate":"29-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123155817","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123155817","DocDate":"01-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123155817","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123155817","DocURL":"01-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110811","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110811","DocDate":"20-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183603","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183603","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3971201161211","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971201161211","DocDate":"04-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3971201161210","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971201161210","DocDate":"04-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3971201161213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971201161213","DocDate":"04-JUL-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
