The project consists of four components: 1) Farm restructuring services will support the development of procedures and institutional mechanisms at the state and selected regions to ensure fair and equitable transfer of land and other farm assets to private individual or groups; and to create sustainable family farms. 2) Irrigation and drainage works will support efforts to repair and replace such facilities in the selected farms so as to create and sustain privatized agriculture at the farm levels; to assist in the establishment of water users' associations; and to establish performance monitoring and evaluation of irrigation water use. 3) Provision of on-time implementation units will support a) a one-time grant to the private family farms by providing a minimal amount of the most critical agricultural inputs to increase crop and or animal productivity; and b) creation of pilot rural savings and credit associations that will meet its members' short and medium term credit needs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":41},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":26},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"TJ","sectorcode":"FE,AI,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"79,39,78,83","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,10,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":41},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":33},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":26}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333038_20080731012437","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080731012437","DocDate":"23-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060731150204","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060731150204","DocDate":"29-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00121302000652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121302000652","DocDate":"20-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201071038","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201071038","DocURL":"21-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201070937","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201070937","DocURL":"21-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200582394","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200582394","DocDate":"21-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99060411143160","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99060411143160","DocDate":"19-MAY-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tajikistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
