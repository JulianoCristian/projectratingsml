The total number of households connected under the project would reach about 1 million covering a population of about 6 million. The project includes: (a) construction of about 15,500 km of primary lines, and about 16,600 km of secondary lines; (b) installation of 10,750 distribution transformers, about 1.0 million kWh meters and 10,500 km of street lighting; (c) supply of tools, implements, equipment and vehicles for construction, installation and servicing; (d) feasibility, detailed engineering and construction of two or more mini-hydro pilot projects; and (e) consultancy services for a study of mini-hydro schemes in Thailand and a study for PEA's operations development. In addition to generating revenues for the electricity sector, the project would produce quantifiable indirect benefits due to fuel cost savings, increased productivity of cottage industries and power tools, and savings in operating costs of other motive power."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"75,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925044550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925044550","DocDate":"30-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925044506","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925044506","DocDate":"28-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e961f6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961f6_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e961f5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961f5_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902354149","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902354149","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912491144","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912491144","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
