The project will support the implementation of the government's population policy announced in March 1991. A program approach has been adopted which will: (1) develop the institutional capacity to foster and manage a comprehensive population program; (2) deliver effective family planning services; (3) generate an increased demand for family planning; and (4) mobilize public awareness and support for the program through government and non-government channels. The project will significantly contribute to improvements in female reproductive health, thus female health in general. The legitimacy of family planning will be strongly enhanced leading to overall improvement in the social welfare of the current generation and ultimately to macro-economic and environmental benefits from moderated population growth. While government policy aims to provide better family planning services nationwide, in the initial phases program strategy will direct efforts to areas of highest population density. Improved family planning services will be fostered through: (a) provision of improved facilities for family planning delivery and counselling, including appropriately equipping the facilities; (b) operational support for management and supervision; (c) staff training in clinical and communication skills; and (d) incremental staffing. The provision of family planning services and the overall population program will be supported through: (i) improved logistics and contraceptive supplies; (ii) enhancement of nongovernment organizations capabilities in this sec"},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine!$!PG","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"6,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PG","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"69,57,64","mjthemecode":"8,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20030625143330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030625143330","DocDate":"20-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122580016","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122580016","DocURL":"01-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122580016","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122580016","DocDate":"01-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004003025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004003025","DocDate":"12-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004002710","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004002710","DocDate":"12-MAR-1993"}],"countryname":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine"}},"facets":{}}
