It will contribute to increased agricultural output through better water management and intensified agricultural extension. (b) Poverty reduction. It will contribute to improved rural incomes and food security by improving production and productivity on irrigation schemes country-wide. (c) Improving environmental management. It will develop techniques for environmental assessment of irrigation rehabilitation and reinforce local capacity. This project will also establish operational procedures for the transfer of management of the operation and maintenance of public irrigation schemes to water users and thus will serve to reduce the burden of public expenditure on the maintenance of such irrigation infrastructure. It will provide the means for more efficient management of the decentralized services of the Ministry of Agriculture in agricultural extension, rural works supervision and local planning and programming."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":71},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":29},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"21,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MG","sectorcode":"BC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"86,85,57,78,52","mjthemecode":"6,10,7,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":71},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":29}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01042804184121","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01042804184121","DocDate":"30-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121232706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121232706","DocDate":"13-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121232706","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121232706","DocURL":"13-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b401_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b401_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005182612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005182612","DocDate":"20-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005182311","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005182311","DocDate":"20-JUN-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Madagascar"}},"facets":{}}
