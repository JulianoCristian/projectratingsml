PRSC series are an integral part of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). PRSC-1 aimed to: (i) help create the basis for private-sector-led economic growth by supporting the Government's macroeconomic program; (ii) support the Government of Benin's public expenditure management reform program; and (iii) support the reform of the public resources management in key sectors, including Health, Education and Water, focusing on the delivery of basic services tailored to the needs of the poor. PRSC2 expanded the coverage to three new sectors (Agriculture, Rural Transportation and Justice), while supporting continued implementation of the Environment and Urban Sanitation and the Forest Management programs as well as re-launching reforms in civil service and decentralization. As a follow-up to PRSC-2, PRSC-3 will maintain a core focus on economic growth and governance, supporting service delivery through improved public expenditure management, financial decentralization, and expanding results-oriented budgeting to new sectors."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Troisi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le Cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-3) qui est propos\u00e9 aidera le Gouvernement du B\u00e9nin \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre sa Strat\u00e9gie de r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 lanc\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre 2002.
