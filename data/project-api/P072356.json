There are three project components. The first component provides grants to build the capacity of village and sub-district councils and to support activities for physical infrastructure, as well as income generating and social welfare activities for widows and vulnerable groups. It also assists sub-districts in services delivery and provides grants to central networks working with highly vulnerable groups; and technical assistance and monitoring. The second component supports cultural heritage by financing the reconstruction of the building for the National Performance and Culture Center, and funding architects and consultants to design and supervise. Small culture grants will support artists and cultural activities at the center, and finance the collection and archiving of oral history. The third component develops radio and television services, specifically by establishing community radio stations and a support center, and funding training and equipment for district reporters."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!$!TP","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":31},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Media","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"8,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Media"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"TP","sectorcode":"CB,BH,TZ,YZ,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"55,57,78,56,77","mjthemecode":"10,6,10,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Media","code":"CB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":31},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":23},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000310607_20060810115713","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20060810115713","DocDate":"27-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052614503299","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052614503299","DocDate":"21-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0106150410150","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0106150410150","DocDate":"30-APR-2001"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste"}},"facets":{}}
