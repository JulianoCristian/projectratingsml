Youth played a seminal role in the violence that erupted in 2006 and which saw hundreds of thousands displaced, property worth thousands of dollars destroyed, hundreds injured, and dozens killed. In the absence of a concerted effort to provide opportunities for youth to engage meaningfully with communities and government in national recovery and development efforts, the risk of youth marginalization from development and civic life will persist. The project will support the Government's efforts to address the social, economic and political factors that led to the involvement of youth in the crisis of 2006 and in the ongoing manifestations of social instability since then. There are two components to the project. The first component is the operationalizing the national youth policy. The second component is the youth for local development."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!$!TP","sector1":{"Name":"Other social
