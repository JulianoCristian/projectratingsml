The reforms on expanding public health service delivery or component B have exceeded projections and expectations with the country tripling its spending for vaccines by fully covering all eligible children with polio, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT), measles and hepatitis B vaccinations, and introducing measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and Hemophilus influenza B (HiB) vaccines in the county. The public health performance grants have also progressed. The reallocation of an additional $20,725,000 to component B is primarily to provide funding cover for the 2010 vaccines with $20,225,000 of the re-allocated amount to finance the vaccines. The funding for vaccines has increased from 6 million USD to 18 million USD brought about by the full coverage to all eligible children of polio, DPT, measles and Hepatitis B vaccines and expansion of the vaccine and the introduction of HiB and MMR vaccines. The $500,000 additional allocation to the performance-based public health awards is expected to support further scaling up of the said performance grants. The re-allocated amount shall be primarily coming from the unallocated 20 million USD. There will be no extension of the project closing date."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory health
