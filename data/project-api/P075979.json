The additional financing (AF) is sought to provide additional resources to scale up the original project activities and to implement two additional activities under component B, Delivery of Basic Health Services, and component C, Cross-Sector Issues (Malaria and HIV/AIDS). The additional financing will cover only the health and the cross-sector HIV/AIDS and malaria components of the SSSP, as the Government's education program has recently benefited from a US$3.6 million Catalytic Fund Grant. The original activities to be scaled up include: (i) rehabilitation of health facilities; and (ii) institutional support to the Ministry of Health (MoH). The additional activities include: (i) construction of residences for health staff in remote areas in order to improve the availability of health services; and (ii) capacity development of the health training school, and training of health personnel, including nurses, in order to increase the availability and quality of human resources in the sector. All activities to be financed under the additional financing are part of the Annual Work Plan (AWP) under the original project, which was agreed upon between the Government and the Bank in October 2009."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Prin!$!ST","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":47},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Other
