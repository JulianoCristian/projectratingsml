There are four project components. The first employsa fund mechanism to solicit, evaluate, and fund service provision subproject proposals to carry out activities to prevent HIV transmission and to provide care for people living with AIDS and their families. the second component finances the technical and managerial capacity of implementing entities to implement policies as well as sustain the process of scaling the HIV/AIDS response. The third component sets up and maintains an information clearing house/database on HIV/AIDS relevant to implementing entities to improve their effectiveness. The fourth component has a strong sub-component that will assess the progress attained in the fight against AIDS nationwide on the basis of the targets defined in the Strategic Framework, and will monitor the advance of activities financed by Garfund, the Ghana AIDS Response Fund."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"JB,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,57,69,88","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":85},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000310607_20071011095403","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20071011095403","DocDate":"19-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060731133427","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060731133427","DocDate":"29-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201180804","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201180804","DocURL":"23-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201180804","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201180804","DocDate":"23-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00121302000351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121302000351","DocDate":"30-NOV-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
