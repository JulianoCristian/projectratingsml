Moreover, the project supports the government of China's efforts to help relatively underdeveloped regions in the interior catch up with the country's faster growing coastal areas. To achieve these objectives, the project will help Chongqing municipality (CM) to: 1) achieve a significant reduction in pollution and restructure productive facilities from its most polluting industry, iron and steel; 2) establish a strategy and prepare a long-term plan to achieve a major reduction in pollution for the whole industrial sector by, inter alia, increasing the effectiveness of CM's environmental regulatory framework and pollution management capability; and 3) initiate a pilot effort to assist industrial enterprises in other industrial sectors to restructure their productive facilities, control pollution and transform themselves into modern corporations. The project will include the following components: 1) support for development and implementation of economic and environmental policy agendas and action plans; 2) relocation of the city's two major polluting steel mills; 3) restructuring of advisory facilities for industrial enterprises; 4) a line of credit to support a pilot program in industrial enterprise reform, pollution control and restructuring; and 5) technical assistance to strengthen environmental regulation, surplus labor reemployment and innovation in state asset management."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
