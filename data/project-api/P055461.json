There are five project components in the first phase of the project. 1) Improvement of social services will improve the targeting and delivery of social services by a better identification of individuals, entities, and relationships. 2) Improved fiscal efficiency will decrease the number of unregistered potential taxpayers and the level of evasions through incorrect tax returns, increasing voluntary compliance through an increased perception of risk of evasion detection. 3) Institutional framework, infrastructure, and common services will provide the legal and technology infrastructure within a comprehensive institutional framework to address the need for a sustainable, systematic and efficient information interchange environment. 4) Management of system will develop and implement the structure and processes to control the execution of the project and eventually to manage the on-going SINTyS program. 5) Project administration will provide the administrative, accounting, and other services to support project execution."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":43},"theme1":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"28,54,33","mjthemecode":"3,6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":57},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":43}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20060726112318","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20060726112318","DocDate":"30-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201430063","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201430063","DocURL":"27-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929100933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929100933","DocDate":"30-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99041308523725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99041308523725","DocDate":"31-MAR-1999"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
