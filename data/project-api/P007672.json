To accomplish its objectives, in addition to providing financing for Small and Medium Scale Mining Enterprises (SMMs), the project will support the following policy changes and institutional reforms in the mining sector: (i) liberalizing private sector access to land with mineral potential and releasing state-held mining reserves; (ii) reducing barriers to foreign investment in mining enterprises; (iii) implementing a mineral rights policy that is conducive to an improved allocation of resources; (iv) reforming the system of mining concessions; (v) phasing out state ownership of enterprises in the sector; (vi) modernizing the government agencies providing support to small and medium scale mining enterprises; (vii) establishing environmental standards for the mining sector; and (viii) phasing out direct Government financing of mining activities."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Mining and other extractive","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Mining and other extractive"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"LB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,86,40","mjthemecode":"4,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Mining and other extractive","code":"LB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99032505561818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99032505561818","DocDate":"28-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032312450804","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032312450804","DocDate":"26-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042211481206","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042211481206","DocDate":"26-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041915395403","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041915395403","DocDate":"26-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042211463605","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042211463605","DocDate":"26-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001074548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001074548","DocDate":"30-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001074404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001074404","DocDate":"30-MAY-1991"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
