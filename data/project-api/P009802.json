It would also provide poles, bamboo, small timber, fodder, fruit, oilseeds and other forest products from the same plantations, generate paid employment for the rural poor, improve environmental conditions, and establish and strengthen the Social Forestry Wings of the Forest Departments of both States. The main project risk is that the free distribution of seedlings might lead to some waste. Experience in other projects indicates strong demand for seedlings but statistics of their survival rate are inadequate. Another risk is that village panchayats might lack sufficient leadership and incentive to assume responsibility for village woodlots. These risks would be minimized by the careful monitoring and supervision of planting programs, and public information and education efforts."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925125756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925125756","DocDate":"30-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05b75_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05b75_1_0","DocDate":"03-AUG-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05b73_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05b73_1_0","DocDate":"03-AUG-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902402439","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902402439","DocDate":"31-JUL-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912580858","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912580858","DocDate":"30-JUN-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
