Its objectives are to: 1) strengthen the financial management and accounting systems that are needed in order to place gas and electricity sales on a commercial basis, and establish Moldavagas and Moldenergo as financially viable energy enterprises; and 2) improve the measurement of consumed energy and the efficiency of electricity production in order to reduce losses and waste of costly imported fuels.  The project will be divided into the following components: 1) overhaul of the Chisinau No. 2 Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant; 2) repair of approximately 180 leaky gas distribution points; 3) gas meter installation; 4) upgrade of accounting and billing systems and financial management; and 5) project management and implementation assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Power","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"MD","sectorcode":"LD,LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,42,81","mjthemecode":"11,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":50},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02072304025615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02072304025615","DocDate":"28-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182743","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200240788","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200240788","DocURL":"23-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200240989","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200240989","DocURL":"23-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200240486","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200240486","DocDate":"23-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200240788","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200240788","DocDate":"23-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200240989","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200240989","DocDate":"23-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200240687","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200240687","DocURL":"23-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200240486","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200240486","DocURL":"23-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200240687","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200240687","DocDate":"23-JUL-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Moldova"}},"facets":{}}
