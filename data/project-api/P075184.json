Given the deeply entrenched nature of many areas requiring reform, this process of institutional, and attitudinal change will take time, and sustained efforts to achieve. Components will support market development services, and collaboration in market promotion, trade fairs, etc., with the private sector. Further support shall strengthen the core functions of the DA and Government agencies concerning agricultural statistics, information technology for agriculture and fisheries, and agricultural training. Initially, it would be implemented in the four Focus Areas supported by the project, complemented with community-based information dissemination systems available to various types of farmers/growers and the general community. Market development investments will focus on rural roads, and other rural infrastructure, strengthened through an appropriate selection, approval and implementation criteria and procedures, to ensure demand-driven, market-oriented investments, supported, primarily through local government units (LGUs) and producer groups. The safety and quality assurance systems for market development will be achieved by strengthening the implementation capacity of the DA's regulatory services, as well as institutional strengthening, and, coordinating with other regulatory agencies to complete a review and action plan, aimed at rationalizing the technical, physical and financial needs for the strengthening, operation and maintenance of laboratories needed to service the DA's overall regulatory system. Furthermore, seeds and horticultural planting material will be supported through the expansion of scion grove"},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry,
