The Additional Financing (AF) credit for the (DMP II) will scale up investments in component 1: physical prevention and mitigation works (90 percent of project funds) and will allocate additional project funds to component 4: project management (10 percent of project funds). The rationale for the request is: (i) the need for additional mitigation works to solidify the gains achieved through works implemented in Dennery Village - one of the most vulnerable communities as prioritized by the government; (ii) the continuation of the successful small mitigation works, including small works in response to last year's Hurricane Dean, and completion of a technical audit of the small mitigation works financed under the DMP II; and (iii) the need to cover some of the additional project management costs."},"country_namecode":"St. Lucia!$!LC","sector1":{"Name":"Flood
