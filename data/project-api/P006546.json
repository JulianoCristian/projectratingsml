As a public health problem with serious negative externalities, the Brazilian government must mobilize resources for raising awareness, reaching groups engaged in high-risk behaviors to promote behavior change, and establishing a functioning infrastructure to cope with the epidemic. The project will put in place a set of institutions and activities that: (i) define a basic program for HIV and STD prevention, and identify what interventions work best; (ii) develop an adequately equipped and technically trained cadre of health professionals able to diagnose, treat and deliver social services to HIV/AIDS patients; (iii) establish effective surveillance for HIV/AIDS and its corollary illnesses (e.g., STDs and tuberculosis); and, finally, (iv) can be sustained by the states and municipalities. The project has four components: (a) prevention; (b) treatment services; (c) institutional development; and (d) surveillance, research and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":83},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"160,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"88,25","mjthemecode":"2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":83},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20050103162746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050103162746","DocDate":"27-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000090341_20040525105833","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040525105833","DocDate":"27-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123001000","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123001000","DocURL":"16-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123001000","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123001000","DocDate":"16-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004083719","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004083719","DocDate":"08-OCT-1993"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
