The project has three components: 1) The School and Community Strengthening component finances (through nonrefundable financial transfers) the development and implementation of school improvement plans (SIPs). To address equity and institutional capacity concerns, information and technical assistance efforts will support weaker schools and communities to develop and implement their own SIPs. 2) The Municipal Education Management and Investments Component finances municipal education plans, and provides information and technical assistance to develop institutional capacity; and 3) The Departmental Education Services component a) strengthens, through training and technical assistance, the nonmanagerial functions of the Departmental Secretariat of Education (consulting, communications, and ex post evaluation); b) consolidates and integrates the existing computerized systems and tools for education evaluation; c) provides a communication network between three levels -the Department, Municipal, and local education administration offices- under the most appropriate technology for each municipality; and d) finances a Department-wide communication strategy to disseminate project objectives, as well as lessons learned in implementing a national strategy to strengthen departmental and municipal management of education."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
