This operation backs the Bank's strategy of supporting Ghana's Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II), which seeks to modernize agriculture through policy and institutional reforms that deliver the following: (i) the gaps between observed and achievable yields are narrowed, particularly for food crops; (ii) post-harvest losses are reduced; (iii) the irrigated area is increased and informal schemes are better managed; (iv) farmer organizations are empowered to better represent economic interests of their members; (v) the management of Ghana's fisheries is improved; and (vi) budgetary resources for agriculture are well allocated and executed. The AgDPO 2 is consistent with the Bank's strategic focus on country systems, and the Government's draft aid policy that seeks a greater share of foreign assistance in the form of budgetary support."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":18},"sector3":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":18},"sector4":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":27},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":10},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":27},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":18},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":18},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Animal production"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"AJ,AH,AI,YA,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Rural development","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,27,79,77,75","mjthemecode":"10,10,10,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":34},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":18},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":18},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120316010932","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120316010932","DocDate":"22-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"090224b081af5efb_2_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081af5efb_2_0","DocDate":"08-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000350881_20100514141135","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20100514141135","DocDate":"03-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100405103110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100405103110","DocDate":"01-APR-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
