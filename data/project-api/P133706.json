This program document states a Reengagement and Reform Support Credit (RRSC) to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for SDR287.75 (US$440 million equivalent). It will be a standalone development policy operation (DPO) program aimed at supporting the full normalization of relations between Myanmar and the World Bank as well as the Government's efforts to undertake critical institutional and policy reforms in the implementation of its medium-term development strategy. In terms of IDA resources, Myanmar is eligible for exceptional support as a reengaging country. Since Myanmar is projected to be at a low risk of debt distress after arrears clearance, IDA resources will be provided on credit terms, per the stipulations of the credit allocation system agreed with IDA donors for the IDA 16 period (FY12-FY14). Going forward, the Government realizes that a key challenge will be to ensure that these reforms translate into improved living standards for the majority of the population, and that gains registered are sustained. The program document is divided into six sections, including this introduction. Second section discusses the country context which gives an overview of Myanmar focusing on the political and economic context, recent economic developments, macroeconomic outlook, and debt sustainability.
