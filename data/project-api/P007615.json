To that end, the project specifically involves (a) corridor improvements, (b) public transport, and (c) road maintenance.  It further entails (d) traffic system management to improve traffic flow and safety.  The proposed project would demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of an integrated transport management approach, emphasizing increased efficiency in the utilization of existing infrastructure as well as minor infrastructure investments, in two major urban areas of Mexico.  At the same time, the project would strengthen the institutional framework at the federal, as well as local, level to prepare and coordinate a similar approach to transport problems in other urban areas in Mexico."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":54},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":44},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"125,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BC,TZ,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,73,44","mjthemecode":"4,9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":54},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":44},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042013511067","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042013511067","DocDate":"31-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040814505668","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040814505668","DocDate":"31-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926041918","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926041918","DocDate":"29-APR-1987"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
