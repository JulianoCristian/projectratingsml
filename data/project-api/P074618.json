The project components will: 1) finance the rehabilitation of the multi-municipal Kotor landfill site, to meet sanitary standards. Such rehabilitation will comprise, other than a new fence, and gate, a groundwater monitoring system, leakage treatment, and a gas collecting system. A new compactor and bulldozer will be provided, to allow an adequate landfill operation, while drainage systems will be installed to control degassing, and drainage. In addition solid waste equipment will be financed to institute long-term environmental monitoring, maintain, and manage the landfill site; 2) finance the completion of the water supply pipeline construction, thus replacing contaminated water sources in the Zeta Valley, with water from the Podgorica municipal water supply system; and, 3) support project implementation, through the provision of funds for the completion of engineering services, and for auditing of project accounts."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Serbia!$!YF","sector1":{"Name":"Solid waste management","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":32},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"2,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Solid waste management"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"YF","sectorcode":"WC,WB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,39,85,84","mjthemecode":"11,11,4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Solid waste management","code":"WB"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":68},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":32}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050324103253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050324103253","DocDate":"11-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052512100040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052512100040","DocDate":"20-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042015592041","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042015592041","DocDate":"20-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02010310121682","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02010310121682","DocDate":"27-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01080304114073","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01080304114073","DocDate":"18-SEP-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01082905092511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01082905092511","DocDate":"10-AUG-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Serbia"}},"facets":{}}
