This will be achieved by improving SOTOCO's (Societe Togolaise du Coton) agricultural support services. Special attention will be given to creating and supporting new farmers groups, introducing integrated pest managment, and providing selected technical assistance. The project will also improve the sector's financial arrangements by gradually eliminating subsidies, changing SOTOCO's operating guidelines so that it can operate along commercial lines, and by implementing a flexible producer price policy that provides incentives to farmers and SOTOCO and is responsive to world market prices. Finally, the project will seek to improve the cost effectiveness of SOTOCO's cotton processing and marketing operations."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Togo!$!TG","sector1":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":37},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":30},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"15,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TG","sectorcode":"BC,AB,YA,AH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"45,75,79","mjthemecode":"10,10,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":37},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":26},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980624090053","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624090053","DocDate":"01-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042610363098","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042610363098","DocDate":"19-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042610332896","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042610332896","DocDate":"27-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042610350597","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042610350597","DocDate":"09-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030211225899","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030211225899","DocDate":"13-FEB-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042214161200","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042214161200","DocDate":"13-FEB-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e082e2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e082e2_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e082e0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e082e0_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926183623","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926183623","DocDate":"31-MAY-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Togo"}},"facets":{}}
