The project comprises the government's agreed rolling roads investment and maintenance program for the five years 1994-1998, coordinating all donors through discrete parallel sub-projects. The first two years of the program have been defined and appraised in detail, as has the scope of the five-year program. A major review after two years and annual reviews thereafter will define in more detail the specifics of the program in the outer years. The civil works program comprises: (a) emergency works to open access in all 10 provinces; (b) rehabilitation of priority trunk roads; (c) labor based reconstruction of priority feeder roads; and (d) current routine and periodic maintenance of that portion of the network that is in good or fair condition. The project will finance engineering services in support of the program and the continuation of the government's Road Sector Institution Building Program commenced under the first Roads and Costal Shipping Project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":93},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"188,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"BH,BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development"],"themecode":"74","mjthemecode":"9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":93},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040108153937","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040108153937","DocDate":"24-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121213051","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121213051","DocDate":"15-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121213051","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121213051","DocURL":"15-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b363_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b363_1_0","DocDate":"07-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e1b362_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b362_1_0","DocDate":"07-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005152850","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005152850","DocDate":"15-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005153139","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005153139","DocDate":"15-MAR-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique"}},"facets":{}}
