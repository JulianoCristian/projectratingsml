The project will be implemented over a period of two years on a national scale. In line with the Government's overall civil service reforms, the project's strategy will be: (a) to assure the delivery of basic agricultural services through the establishment of a National Agricultural Services Agency (ANADER) which will be the Government's main sub-contractor for extension, adaptive research and support to farmers' organizations; and (b) to streamline and strengthen MINAGRA's regional directorate (DRAs) in each of the ten regions of the country. DRAs' role will be refocused on their public service mandate geared to establishment and implementation of agricultural policies and regulations. As part of this mandate, they will be given clear responsibilities and directions to assist in the development of private sector initiatives. In support of the above strategy, the project will include the following components: (a) restructuring process; (b) operating support to ANADER; and (c) institutional strengthening."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire!$!CI","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":56},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":44},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"21,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CI","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,77,25,57","mjthemecode":"7,2,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":56},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":44}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980728143834","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980728143834","DocDate":"30-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121232002","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121232002","DocURL":"12-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121232203","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121232203","DocDate":"12-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121232002","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121232002","DocDate":"12-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121232203","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121232203","DocURL":"12-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b3ea_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b3ea_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b3e9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b3e9_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005170029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005170029","DocDate":"15-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005170328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005170328","DocDate":"09-JUN-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire"}},"facets":{}}
