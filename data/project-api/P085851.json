Its objectives are to consolidate, and expand quality improvements in initial, and basic education, covering, inter alia, infrastructure improvements, didactic materials provision, teacher training, school supervision, implementation of school-based management strategies, and continued strengthening of the institutional capacity of the states in planning, programming, and evaluating the delivery of basic education services. Through its components, the project will: 1) provide out-of-school training for parents, and adults directly involved in raising small children, with the objective of contributing to the child's comprehensive development, prior to preschool attendance. The training is targeted to families in indigenous, or low-income rural communities; 2) support basic education, seeking to improve basic education indicators in isolated, rural communities, through interventions comprising materials, and pedagogic and school management actions in selected preschools, in primary and in lower-secondary schools. In addition, rehabilitation of, and equipment supply for teachers' centers will be supported. This includes didactic materials, training and technical assistance to school councils, performance incentives for primary school teachers, and, support for school supervision; and, 3) strengthen institutional capacities allowing improved planning, programming, and evaluation of basic education delivery.
