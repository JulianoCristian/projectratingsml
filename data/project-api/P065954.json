The overarching objectives are to: (a) improve fiscal discipline through structural changes in the health sector, that will alleviate the chronic problem of arrears in the sector, encourage greater technical, and allocation efficiency, and institute a system that will promote fiscal sustainability; (b) improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of the health sector; and, (c) mitigate any possible negative impacts on health care access, especially for vulnerable populations. Implementation of the reforms supported by HSMS SECAL would contribute significantly to expenditure control in the short term, and reductions in the medium term. However, risks include weak expenditure management by health insurance companies and hospitals, and excess hospital capacity. While it is imperative that key legislation is passed, so that the reform implementation have the appropriate legal support, there is the likelihood of adverse outcomes due to reform itself. Nevertheless, in the current context of already high expenditures for health care, there is little realistic opportunity to mobilize significant additional resources, to balance expenditures and revenues. For the government strategy to succeed, measures to mitigate risks include a careful sequencing and phasing of the reforms, supported by laws and regulations, including prudent financial supervision, where regulations, and incentive structures should be technically designed. Monitoring capacity of access to health care, and private expenditures should be established, including capacity building for key health sector staff."},"country_namecode":"Slovak Republic!$!SK","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"62,920,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"SK","sectorcode":"BC,BK,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Economic management","Human development"],"themecode":"67,21,56","mjthemecode":"6,1,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":60},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080730011512","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080730011512","DocDate":"19-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000160016_20050816114736","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050816114736","DocDate":"11-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201595679","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201595679","DocURL":"02-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201595478","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201595478","DocDate":"02-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201595679","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201595679","DocDate":"02-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20030822133320","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030822133320","DocDate":"18-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03032504044724","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03032504044724","DocDate":"30-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03052804025212","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052804025212","DocDate":"20-MAY-2003"}],"countryname":"Slovak Republic"}},"facets":{}}
