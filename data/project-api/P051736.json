The project components are as follows: a) System expansion covers the planning, design, supply, and construction of approximately 993 km of 500 kV (kilowatt) transmission lines; the construction of five new 500 kV substations and the expansion of two existing 500 kV ones; and the reinforcement of Nanjing's urban transmission system.  b) Implementation assistance will support local and international consulting services for engineering and construction management.  c) Technical assistance for improved interprovincial power exchange policies and procedures will develop an incentive framework and institutional basis for resource pooling and efficient power trading between provincial systems.  d) Technical assistance for improved accounting and financial management systems will support cost accounting, performance evaluation, and financial planning.  e) Institutional development and training will provide training programs, and support the procurement and installation of required hardware and software for power system analysis."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
