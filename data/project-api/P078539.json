The closing date for the will be extended from March 31, 2012 until September 30, 2012. The project has made significant progress on the first outcome, as the number of districts that have reached the global targets has increased to 284 from the 2006 baseline of 168. With regard to the second outcome, the estimated incidence of TB has declined to 1.10 percent from a baseline of 1.50 percent. Nationally, the program has overall met the global targets, exceeding 70 percent detection of new smear positive TB cases (73.5 percent to the third quarter of 2011) and successfully treating over 85 percent of those cases (87.6 percent to the third quarter of 2011). The extension is necessary to allow time for appraisal of a government request for additional financing and extension of the project. A detailed action plan for the next six months has been agreed with the Project. Project activities will continue during this period. This will be the first extension of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":72},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government
