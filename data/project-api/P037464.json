The first three years of the investment plan call for expenditures equivalent to US$87.80 million on specialized rolling stock, workshop and signalling equipment and a third ferry boat; and it includes progress payments on a fourth ferry boat to be delivered in the year to March 31, 1974. The rolling stock to be financed by the Bank will include 490 flatcars for the transport of containers. The remaining 1,310 freightcars for which financing would be provided from the Loan are intended for the transport of pulp and paper, steel, timber and other bulk traffic; in addition, certain workshop equipment and the modernization of signalling equipment on two lines are to be financed. Of the flatcars 610 are to be manufactured in the Railways workshops using Bank-financed imported components."},"country_namecode":"New Zealand!$!NZ","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"16,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"NZ","sectorcode":"TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901192127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901192127","DocDate":"11-FEB-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903180520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903180520","DocDate":"28-FEB-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903323548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903323548","DocDate":"28-FEB-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a628_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a628_1_0","DocDate":"23-FEB-1971"}],"countryname":"New Zealand"}},"facets":{}}
