These six city center markets provide water supply, toilet and ablution facilities. Garbage collection, disposal facilities, solid waste operations and repairs are being added to market building structures. The project rehabilitates and upgrades access roads to the project area, as well as, the improvement of the Government of Sierra Leone's (GVWC) water supply system and operations by reducing water leakage through a metering and connection program. The institutional capabilities of the Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) to manage and coordinate this project is being strengthened. Technical assistance and coordinated studies are in place to address longer-term issues of infrastructural development in Greater Freetown. Financial review of the Freetown City Council (FCC) and city traffic management is also necessary."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Sierra Leone!$!SL","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and
