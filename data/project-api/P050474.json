The project has two main components. At the federal level, the project will build capacity to support the education reform strategy of the Russian government through the development of new policies, services, and procedures. The sub-components include: education policy reform, quality monitoring and statistics, training and retraining, and courses for new professions and teaching and learning materials to develop work-related core skills. At the regional level, the project will pilot essential reforms in general and initial vocational education in three regions selected on a transparent basis: Samara Oblast, Yaroslavl Oblast, and the Chuvash Republic. A third component, Project Management, will fund effective project coordination."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"EP,BH,BC,EV,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"78,51,65,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8,6,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":35},{"Name":"Education","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070816115917","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070816115917","DocDate":"25-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041411443970","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041411443970","DocDate":"08-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99032505584689","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99032505584689","DocDate":"11-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01051604004481","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01051604004481","DocDate":"30-APR-2001"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
