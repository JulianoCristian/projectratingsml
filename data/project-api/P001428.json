Improved farm inputs would be provided to about 6,300 small and medium-size farmers on the basis of credit along with extension services, training of farmers and tappers, and assistance for on-farm processing and marketing. The project would also aim at institution building by establishing a Rubber Development Unit as a permanent extension service and training of Liberian staff at all levels. At peak production, the project would increase rubber production from Liberian-owned farms by more than 100% of the present output and would bring about a substantial increase in productivity and the income of small and medium rubber farmers. The project faces no special risks that cannot be overcome through advance planning and appropriate cultivation practices."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Liberia!$!LR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"13,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Agreement","countrycode":"LR","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924201549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924201549","DocDate":"24-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902301218","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902301218","DocDate":"31-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912291729","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912291729","DocDate":"31-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228ba6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228ba6_1_0","DocDate":"30-MAR-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Liberia"}},"facets":{}}
