The project has four components.  First, small-scale irrigation will result in expansion in area, modernization, and installation of drainage systems.  Second, groundwater prospecting and monitoring will include drilling of 212 exploratory tubewells, 115 piezometers, and acquisition of one geophysical resistivity unit. Third, research will support specific priority research projects.  Fourth, extension and training will finance rehabilitation of seven existing training centers and the upgrading of the central training unit at Sidi Thabet."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":53},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"42,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"BC,AB,AI,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,26,85,57,77","mjthemecode":"10,7,11,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":53},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":34},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030701173110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030701173110","DocDate":"26-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201385083","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201385083","DocDate":"16-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201385083","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201385083","DocURL":"16-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000386194_20120926042403","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120926042403","DocDate":"30-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980217140212","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980217140212","DocDate":"30-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184821","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
