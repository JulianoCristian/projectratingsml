The project would also support and reinforce other ongoing investments in Iloilo under the national programs to increase their impact on agricultural productivity, and assist in preparations for the extension of multiple cropping technology to other provinces. It provides for increasing agricultural production, improving marketing and extension, training support staff and community members and strengthening existing institutions responsible for project implementation. The project would also provide for the construction of a grains storage and shipment facility and water impounding facilities, programs for improving nutrition through the control of anemia and diarrhea, and consultant services for the preparation of future similar projects in Mindanao. Approximately 40,000 farm families and 5,000 landless laborers' families, or a total of about 27,000 people, would benefit directly from increased production and employment resulting from the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924225430","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924225430","DocDate":"30-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924225344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924225344","DocDate":"30-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9612d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9612d_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902343935","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902343935","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912474278","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912474278","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
