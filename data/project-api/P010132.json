It provides in five districts for an increase in the number of extension staff and suitable housing and vehicles for them. In the remaining seven districts, existing staff will be provided with suitable vehicles. The project will also establish four adaptive research farms, two soil testing laboratories and pest scouting services on a pilot scale in one district. The main project benefit will be an increase in production, particularly foodgrains, as a consequence of the impact of the new extension and research system on agricultural yields. Marginal and small farmers, now living close to or below the poverty line, will be the primary beneficiaries of the new system and of the project's emphasis on efficient use of exisiting resources."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902330434","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902330434","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd19e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd19e_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c72_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c72_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
