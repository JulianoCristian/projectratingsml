Specific project objectives, therefore, are: 1) to help remove critical infrastructural bottlenecks; improve essential services and facilities; preserve existing infrastructural assets; and create productive employment; and 2) to strengthen the local government system, particularly to rationalize roles and responsibilities and build finance and managerial capacity. The project will consist of the following components: 1) infrastructure rehabilitation and improvement including: (a) a rehabilitation and improvement sub-program; (b) a maintenance sub-program; and (c) a neighborhood upgrading sub-program; 2) local government reform and capacity building comprising: (a) local government technical assistance and capacity building; and (b) selected municipality technical assistance and capacity building; and 3) managerial support and incremental operating expenses."},"country_namecode":"West Bank and Gaza!$!GZ","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":51},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GZ","sectorcode":"WC,WS,WA,BH,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,39,44,73","mjthemecode":"9,4,4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":51},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040108164709","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040108164709","DocDate":"29-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042813152307","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042813152307","DocDate":"18-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042813174205","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042813174205","DocDate":"06-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050411110206","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050411110206","DocDate":"12-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022114255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022114255","DocDate":"07-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"West Bank and Gaza"}},"facets":{}}
