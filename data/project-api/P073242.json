The objective of the Project is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases from the Vilnius District Heating System by reducing barriers, and implementing, financially sustainable and replicable energy efficiency investments in the residential sector of the Vilnius City. This would be achieved by: co-financing demand management programs which would demonstrate the benefits of automatic, and consumer-controlled use of heat in homes, and consumption-based billing at the apartment level; a limited grant (or capital subsidy) financing from the GEF, that would cover the cost of down-payments (connection fees) for Apartment Level Demand Side Management equipment - particularly, for low-income customers. A commercially sustainable (revolving) financial facility will be created - ECP Commercial Fund - to support the implementation of investments aimed at reducing heat losses from the City's housing stock. The facility would provide both financing, and technical assistance for such investments, mobilizing additional financing from commercial sources as appropriate. Moreover, monitoring, evaluation, and information dissemination activities will be implemented, aimed at facilitating the replication of the Project's experience."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Lithuania!$!LT","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"6,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Note on Cancelled Operation,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"LT","sectorcode":"LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,38,73","mjthemecode":"9,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090730001220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090730001220","DocDate":"29-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000160016_20040614172801","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040614172801","DocDate":"03-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052810492673","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052810492673","DocDate":"15-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052810453872","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052810453872","DocDate":"15-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042910005074","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042910005074","DocDate":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042909591675","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042909591675","DocDate":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03060604114063","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03060604114063","DocDate":"05-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03060404011425","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03060404011425","DocDate":"30-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000090341_20040503144044","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040503144044","DocDate":"22-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20030522100245","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030522100245","DocDate":"19-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00012505454658","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00012505454658","DocDate":"11-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01080904110847","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01080904110847","DocDate":"27-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01040305301640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01040305301640","DocDate":"22-MAR-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Lithuania"}},"facets":{}}
