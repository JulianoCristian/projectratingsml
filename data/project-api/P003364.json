The first project concentrated on creating a viable seed production institution with a modest infrastructure to produce two seed crops--paddy and cotton. The project will cover five additional priority crops, expand into new geographic areas, and introduce seed quality control up to the multiplication of the last generation of seed (Certified Seed). The project will also strengthen and expand the existing seed handling institutions in order to establish a comprehensive seed processing and distribution system. The project will achieve this objective by fully developing 12 existing Government farms for basic seed production. For the last generation of seed, the project will organize a seed multiplication structure with at least 17,000 private farmers participating as contract seed growers. It will further expand and strengthen seed quality control and increase the seed processing capacity through installation of new processing plants, including drying and storage. The project also includes a technical assistance and a training component."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar!$!MM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Annual crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"14,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Annual crops"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MM","sectorcode":"AQ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Annual crops","code":"AQ"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019171131","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019171131","DocDate":"29-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e061cd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e061cd_1_0","DocDate":"20-JUN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094937","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094937","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904162513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904162513","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar"}},"facets":{}}
