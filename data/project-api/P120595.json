This project restructuring involves adding 'Force Account' as an additional procurement method for civil works and amending the Financing Agreement to allow this. The civil works for this project will be taking place on Niuatoputapu, an isolated island approximately 330 nautical miles from the capital of Nuku'alofa. In accordance with paragraph 3.8 of 'Guidelines: procurement under International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Loans and International Development Association (IDA) Credits\" published by the Bank in May 2004 and revised in October 2006 and May 2010, it is justified to use Force Account where qualified private construction firms are unlikely to bid for these small works contracts at reasonable prices, and as this is an emergency operation, prompt construction is necessary."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Tonga!$!TO","sector1":{"Name":"Housing
