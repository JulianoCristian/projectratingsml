The restructuring will reallocate the funds that were originally set aside to support the Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG) to the International Development Association (IDA) grant to cover a funding gap in the implementation of critical safeguard activities under components B and C. The funding gap is the result of higher than anticipated costs for originally planned safeguard activities, the inclusion of additional safeguard activities that had not been originally planned for financing through the IDA grant, and the shortfall created by the unavailability of funding from carbon offsets that were expected to cover safeguards-related work when the project was originally approved by the Board in 2005. Moreover, the restructuring proposes to amend the project development objective and associated indicators to reflect these changes, and to extend the project closing date by 24 months from September 30, 2010, to September 30, 2012, to complete the remaining project activities under components B and C."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Sierra Leone!$!SL","sector1":{"Name":"Central government
