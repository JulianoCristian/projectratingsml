Using a sector lending approach, the project has four components: (i) port sector investments, including modernization at Porto Grande in the Island of Sao Vicente, and port rehabilitation at Vale De Cavaleiros in the Island of Fogo; (ii) reorganization of shipping under an action plan to redesign the institutional framework, and provide the right incentives to private shipowners; (iii) highway sector improvement through execution, mainly by private contractors, of a time slice of the investment and maintenance program (1993-1996); and (iv) establishment of an institutional framework to develop satellite earth station teleports by private investors."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cabo Verde!$!CV","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and
