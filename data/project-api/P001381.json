The Project would improve Lesotho's national road network, and improve the road maintenance capability of the Roads Branch of the Ministry of Works. The project does not face any unusual risks. However, the maintenance program could be affected by inadequate and irregular budgetary allocations to the Roads Branch. This risk has been addressed by the Government's undertaking to give adequate budgetary allocations to RB on the first day of each quarter in the fiscal year."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Lesotho!$!LS","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LS","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924180606","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924180606","DocDate":"30-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c57_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c57_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c56_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c56_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902320822","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902320822","DocDate":"28-FEB-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912414696","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912414696","DocDate":"28-FEB-1979"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Lesotho"}},"facets":{}}
