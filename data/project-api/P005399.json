The principal objectives of the project are: (a) the provision of foreign exchange needed to finance efficient projects undertaken by manufacturing and service companies; this is a continuation of the line of credit provided to BNDE under previous Bank loans; (b) the promotion and financing of efficient export-oriented projects (minimum 20 percent of the loan component); the selection, evaluation, promotion and follow-up of these projects, as well as other studies to be undertaken, will help to develop BNDE expertise in this field; and (c) the further strengthening of BNDE, particularly in the areas of project supervision, collection of arrears, as well as activities in support of export-oriented industries."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"70,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925080218","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925080218","DocDate":"26-OCT-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902380549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902380549","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912540442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912540442","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
