Although this process is incomplete, the results thus far have been encouraging. However, a need still exists at the subsector level to provide financial and technical assistance to help individual enterprises to restructure and adjust to the increasingly deregulated, more competitive environment. The Industrial Restructuring Project will address this need through: (i) an investment credit component to provide financial assistance through participating financial institutions (PFI) for restructuring projects, including environmental actions in eligible enterprises; (ii) a technical assistance component to strengthen institutional capabilities and technical services, and improve the abilities of the PFIs to evaluate the technical, environmental, financial, and economic aspects of the proposals; and (iii) a studies component for preparation of a second restructuring project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"284,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"FA,YW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,86","mjthemecode":"11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":95},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145515","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145515","DocDate":"20-FEB-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042112111305","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042112111305","DocDate":"01-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042112140107","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042112140107","DocDate":"01-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031714325704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031714325704","DocDate":"01-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042112123706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042112123706","DocDate":"01-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927135149","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927135149","DocDate":"31-MAR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927134652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927134652","DocDate":"31-MAR-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
