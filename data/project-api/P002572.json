Over a four year period, the project would support improvements and expansion in MFC's extension activities, a program of adaptive trials and related research, an access road building program, importation of spare parts for the mechanized dryland farmers, and a limited reorganization and strengthening of MFC's headquarters. The project would also support a smallholder development and trials unit at el Fuda in Southern Kordofan and a pilot village smallholder mechanization program in eastern Sudan. Items to be financed under ther project would include vehicles; agricultural machinery; spare parts for agricultural machinery; buildings and road construction; internationally recruited staff and a proportion of operating costs for some of the components.
