It is part of a long-term strategy aiming at sustainable agricultural development through modernization of agricultural practices, envrionmental measures and population policies.  Specifically, it will help : a) reorganize and strengthen the extension services of 5 of the country's 23 CIRVAs (Agricultural extension districts) : Ambatondrazaka, Antananarivo, Miarinarivo, Moramanga, and Amparafaravolo; b) provide systematic in-service training for project staff at all levels; c) focus adaptive research on validation and diffusion of economically and environmentally sound technology; d) strengthen the monitoring and evaluation capability at both the central and regional levels; e) strengthen financial management; f) improve organizational and managerial capacity of the DVA; and g) make funds available for studies, an in-depth project review, and the preparation of a follow-up project that will draw on the results of the project review.  The study program is intended to look at ways to reduce the cost of extension to the Government through : 1) involving the private sector and NGOs more forcefully; 2) reducing costs at the DVA (e.g. reducing excess personnel); and 3) reviewing the possibility of cost recovery mechanisms."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"3,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MG","sectorcode":"AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development"],"themecode":"78","mjthemecode":"10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019194025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019194025","DocDate":"04-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120571182","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120571182","DocURL":"18-JUL-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120570981","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120570981","DocDate":"18-JUL-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120570981","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120570981","DocURL":"18-JUL-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120571182","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120571182","DocDate":"18-JUL-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0830b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0830b_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929070548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929070548","DocDate":"30-APR-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of Madagascar"}},"facets":{}}
