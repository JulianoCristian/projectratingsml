This project will be implemented over six years and has four components. The first has four subcomponents: 1) stakeholder training to promote economic, social, and environmental sustainability at microcatchment level; 2) environmental education of farmers and fishermen that enables them to solve environmental problems, and environmental teaching projects implemented in municipal and state schools; 3) recruiting and training extension agents; and 4) adaptive and social research as well as socioenvironmental mapping. The second component identifies and carries out rural investments that increase value of agricultural products, improve land management practices, equip rural homes with basic sanitation, protect water sources, and dispose of pig waste satisfactorily. The third component focuses on environmental management by implementing sub-catchment plans, establishes ecological corridors, consolidates protected areas, and creates economic incentives. The fourth component finances project monitoring, and monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of
