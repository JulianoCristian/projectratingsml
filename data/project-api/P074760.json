This PSAC gives particular attention to the first, second, and fourth pillars of the PRSP, responding to the government's emphasis on the urgent need to accelerate economic growth, build the country's human resource base and improve governance. Within the first pillar, the PSAC emphasizes measures and policies to improve the private investment climate, especially to attract foreign direct investment and on strengthening the financial system, including the regulatory environment for micro-finance institutions.  The project will support the second pillar of the PRSP by focusing on measures to raise the coverage and quality of primary education, increase the coverage and quality of basic health services, especially in rural areas, improve child nutrition indicators, increase the coverage of water and sanitation services, and strengthen reproductive health programs.  Within the fourth pillar, the project emphasizes measures to improve transparency and strengthen public expenditure management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Nicaragua!$!NI","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":16},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,President's Report,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"NI","sectorcode":"AZ,BZ,EZ,YZ,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"70,79,53,56,23","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"1,6,6,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201334364","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201334364","DocURL":"19-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"President's Report (PR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PR","EntityID":"000094946_03010804083163","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03010804083163","DocDate":"18-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000112742_20030519114208","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20030519114208","DocDate":"18-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02111404375835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02111404375835","DocDate":"05-NOV-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Nicaragua","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
