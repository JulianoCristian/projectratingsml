The project will: (i) rehabilitate and upgrade irrigation and drainage facilities in Yerqiang and Weigan oases through construction of canal lining, drainage canals, diversion structures, tubewells and onfarm works for low yielding land and reclaimed areas of desert wasteland; (ii) construct a small hydro-power station on the Yerqiang River and inter-connecting transmission grid to expand the electrical generating and transmission capacities; (iii) finance the improvement and expansion of the agricultural extension system at county and township levels; seed processing, distribution and multiplication systems; farm mechanization centers; hail suppression system, and research in cotton; (iv) finance the expansion of livestock services in breed improvement, veterinary and feed development services, improved research and training and development of mixed crop/livestock farms; and (v) finance an ecosystem restoration component designed to recover some of the natural forest along the Tarim River which boarders the Taklimakan desert to prevent expansion of the desert."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
