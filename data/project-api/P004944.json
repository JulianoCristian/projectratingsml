The project will strengthen the institutions working in these areas and, through appropriate testing, will develop the policy and technical basis for replication of suitable project components as part of a national resource management program. The project will comprise:  (a) studies to:  (i) identify how much of Algeria's wood needs could be met domestically, (ii) simplify and improve forestry planning and test ways to integrate forest activities with those of livestock owners, and (iii) provide a master plan for major watersheds; (b) pilot reforestation of 4,3000 ha and pilot exploitation operations to introduce new, low-cost techniques; (c) watershed management operations to introduce new, low-cost approaches to increase farmers' incomes and to reduce erosion on some 10,000 ha of fragile and eroded land; (d) nature conservation with emphasis on the strengthening of the applied research capacity in this area and on training and the supply of equipment; and (e) support activities including related applied forest research, institution strengthening, vehicle and equipment purchases, buildings, training and technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":77},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":23},"theme1":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"AI,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"85,82,80","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":77},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":23}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20120824020918","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120824020918","DocDate":"30-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122515962","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122515962","DocURL":"05-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122515962","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122515962","DocDate":"05-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960930163309","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930163309","DocDate":"20-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930162927","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930162927","DocDate":"18-MAY-1992"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
