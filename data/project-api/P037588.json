This project is the first three-year phase of a long-term, 11-year program. There are four components. The first strengthens ANADER's (National Rural Development Agency) institutional reform and invests in human and physical infrastructure through adaptive research, extension, and support for farmers' organizations. The second component supports the National Agricultural Research Center (CNRA); strengthens the Ministry of Scientific Research to ensure the integration of agricultural research in national strategic planning and coordination of interdisciplinary research programs; and finances investments in research infrastructure and programs, scientific networking, and other capacity-building activities such as training and study tours. The third component helps the Central Planning Directorate decentralize its activities; helps the Statistics Directorate produce reliable statistics and carry out a national agricultural census; helps the Central Livestock Directorate plan and coordinate animal genetic improvement programs; and strengthens the policy-making and coordination activities of the Central Cooperative Directorate. The last component helps disseminate information on market/price, agricultural, and environmental issues by radio and television programs, installs rural radios, and funds technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire!$!CI","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Media","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":16},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Media"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"CI","sectorcode":"CB,BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Rural development","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,75,78,77,83","mjthemecode":"11,10,10,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Media","code":"CB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":85},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040107114748","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040107114748","DocDate":"30-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123512995","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123512995","DocURL":"18-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123512794","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123512794","DocURL":"18-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123513096","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123513096","DocURL":"18-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123512794","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123512794","DocDate":"18-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123512995","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123512995","DocDate":"18-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123513096","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123513096","DocDate":"18-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980716170906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980716170906","DocDate":"23-JUN-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire"}},"facets":{}}
