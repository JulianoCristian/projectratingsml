It includes (i) an investment component of US$7.2 million equivalent to finance development projects promoted by SSEs; and (ii) a technical assistance and training component of US$0.8 million. This last component aims to (a) help small entrepreneurs to prepare and manage their projects and (b) strengthen the participating financial intermediaries' capacity to appraise and supervise investment projects. The project will help nurture SSE development which is expected to generate new job opportunities at a relatively low capital cost. It is expected that the credit component will help create 2500 new jobs at an average cost of US$4000 per job."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Burundi!$!BI","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other finance","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other finance"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"BI","sectorcode":"FY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other finance","code":"FY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120355510","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120355510","DocURL":"08-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120355209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120355209","DocDate":"08-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120355209","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120355209","DocURL":"08-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120355711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120355711","DocDate":"08-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120355711","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120355711","DocURL":"08-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120355510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120355510","DocDate":"08-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e07ec5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07ec5_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08207_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08207_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Burundi"}},"facets":{}}
