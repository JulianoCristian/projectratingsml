The project will supply school facilities in under supplied areas. It will increase rural primary education participation by improving the accessibility of textbooks and educational materials, and by supporting community initiatives to encourage families to send children to school. Quality improvements such as curriculum development, improved teacher selection, improved multigrade teaching, and the introduction of health education in primary schools will also be implemented. Further to this, the project will strengthen school mapping services and improve efficiency in the utilization of resources."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":97},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"83,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"EP,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,61,70,78","mjthemecode":"10,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3},{"Name":"Education","Percent":97}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3971023103551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971023103551","DocDate":"23-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042910135774","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042910135774","DocDate":"16-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040810554876","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040810554876","DocDate":"21-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927124502","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927124502","DocDate":"28-FEB-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927124809","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927124809","DocDate":"22-FEB-1989"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
