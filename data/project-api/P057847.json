The project will help avert further deterioration of natural resources (soil, water, forest, fishery, and biodiversity) and stabilize incomes in the local communities. There are three project components. The first component focuses on selected micro-catchments. Support will be provided for preparation and implementation of community forest management plans; local assistance initiatives which benefit biodiversity conservation through community small grants; community pasture management; sustainable agricultural practices; community infrastructure and income generation; and development of community institutions. The second component supports rehabilitation, protection, and sustainable management of state forests in the project area; improves the forest sector's institutional, legal, and policy framework; and enhances institutional capacity to monitor and control forest operations. The third component supports measures to improve the role of two key protected areas in the conservation and sustainable use of the region's biodiversity and sustain these improvements; and improves the capacity of the Department of Bio-resources and Land Protection of the Ministry of Nature Protection to meet its conservation mandate."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Armenia!$!AM","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":11},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":11},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"8,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"AM","sectorcode":"BH,BC,JB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,82,77,57,80","mjthemecode":"11,7,10,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":85},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":11},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20091016015915","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20091016015915","DocDate":"10-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062411243196","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062411243196","DocDate":"01-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030214421395","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030214421395","DocDate":"01-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02052204041493","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02052204041493","DocDate":"10-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00021005305248","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00021005305248","DocDate":"06-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02022704080445","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022704080445","DocDate":"31-JAN-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Armenia"}},"facets":{}}
