The main objective of the PRS, which analyzes the causes of poverty and encompasses reforms and investment programs in a broad range of sectors, is to reduce poverty by 24 percentage points over the period 2001-2015. Overall, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the associated first Progress Report (PRSP-PR), which was discussed by the Board in February 2004, present a strategy to reduce poverty in Honduras. The strategy itself is structured around six pillars: (1) accelerating equitable and sustainable growth to levels consistent with the income poverty reduction targets; (2) reducing rural poverty; (3) reducing urban poverty; (4) enhancing investment in human capital; 5) strengthening social protection for specific vulnerable groups; and (6) ensuring the sustainability of the strategy through governance and institutional reforms and enhanced environmental sustainability. In line with these pillars, the PRSC aims to support Government's efforts to: accelerate pro-poor growth, via support for reforms aimed at increasing competitiveness and maximizing the potential for new investment and employment-creation for men and   women in both urban and rural areas in the wake of new regional and international agreements, in particular, the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA);
