The project components will: 1) design, and construct sanitary landfills for the Jenin District, seeking to serve over two hundred thousand people. This will include earth works, lining of the site with geotextile membranes, and construction of off-site infrastructure, including access roads, service compound, leachate transfers, and treatment systems. Provision of funds for international construction management will be available to oversee the construction phase, and, rehabilitation/closure of uncontrolled dumpsites will be financed as well. Cost recovery will be phased-in during operation of the landfill; 2) supply equipment for primary collection, haulage, and disposal of solid wastes for municipalities, mostly funded through a European Union grant, possibly financing as well, incremental operations, and maintenance expenses; and, 3) build institutional capacity, providing expertise to train staff from the Ministry of Environmental Affairs, by providing solid waste management training to participating municipalities, and the Joint Services Council; by funding pilot recycling schemes at the landfill site; and, by financing a public awareness campaign."},"country_namecode":"West Bank and Gaza!$!GZ","sector1":{"Name":"Solid waste management","Percent":89},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
