There are three components: 1) rehabilitating and equipping selected health facilities to facilitate the delivery of good quality health care to the population, which will also have a direct favorable impact on cost recovery by those facilities; 2) controlling malaria by improving the case management at all levels of the health service, educating the population for a better use of services and to improve case management at home, and preventive activities including mosquito control to reduce the incidence of the disease; and 3) institutional strengthening to facilitate and support the increased use of quality care by the population and to further implement health sector reforms, including a) training the staff of the public health and population ministry (MOH) and the health facilities staff in the delivery of quality health care, management, and accounting; b) studies to develop alternative mechanisms for health financing; and c) technical assistance, logistical support, and equipment for MOH's central and regional directorates and for PNAC (the agency in charge of marketing drugs)."},"country_namecode":"Union of the Comoros!$!KM","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":79},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Malaria","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"8,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"KM","sectorcode":"BK,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"67,63,92","mjthemecode":"8,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Malaria","code":"92"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":79},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20041216085436","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041216085436","DocDate":"07-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030515223746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030515223746","DocDate":"19-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980312102356","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980312102356","DocDate":"30-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929100351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929100351","DocDate":"14-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903284657","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903284657","DocDate":"24-NOV-1997"}],"countryname":"Union of the Comoros"}},"facets":{}}
