The extension is necessary to complete the review of draft final reports under component one (Khudoni hydropower feasibility study) of the project. The review may expectedly lead to minor additional work to make the reports final, as advised by the panel of experts in their report of September 2010. Also, contractual arrangements for the feasibility study work will be revised during the extension period. This will be the second extension of the project. Cumulative extensions do not exceed the two years period."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":56},"sector2":{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and
