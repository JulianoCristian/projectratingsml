The paper recommends the extension of the closing date of the GPOBA grant from December 31, 2011, until June 30, 2013, which will allow access of poor households in rural towns and villages to electricity service by assisting EEPCo in its connection charge financing program, extending five-year, interest-free loans to low income customers to make access to electricity affordable.
