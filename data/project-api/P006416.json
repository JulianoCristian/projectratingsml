The action program includes measures for an organizational and financial restructuring of FEPASA, the rationalization of railway operations and improved corporate and business planning.  It further includes appropriate tariffs and effective marketing and cost-control, upgraded operations and maintenance management systems, and effective personnel management and training.  The investment component essentially includes the rehabilitation and improvement of the most critical line sections, yards, telecommunication systems, rolling stock and workshops, and track maintenance and intermodal facilities.  Quantifiable project benefits will be realized by FEPASA in the form of cost savings on train and yard operations and on track maintenance which will, to a large extent, be passed over to the railway users."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BH,TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,78","mjthemecode":"10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170738","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170738","DocDate":"15-NOV-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042711350305","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042711350305","DocDate":"03-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042711332704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042711332704","DocDate":"27-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032415073907","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032415073907","DocDate":"27-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042208312106","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042208312106","DocDate":"27-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042711320008","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042711320008","DocDate":"27-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171449","DocDate":"18-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
