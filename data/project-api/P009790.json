Its main components include: (a) installation at four refineries of additional capacity and secondary processing facilities to convert fuel oil into higher-value products; (b) additions to petroleum tankage and distribution facilities; (c) facilities to reduce energy requirements; and (d) pollution control facilities. The project faces only limited risks in that it involves primarily the expansion and rationalization of existing facilities, using commercially proven technology."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"GS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","code":"GS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925101330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925101330","DocDate":"28-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e9739f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9739f_1_0","DocDate":"06-APR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9739d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9739d_1_0","DocDate":"06-APR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902391491","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902391491","DocDate":"31-MAR-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
