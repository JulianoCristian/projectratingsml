To this end, the project components will: 1) fund the establishment of the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), develop its internal systems, management team, and governance structure. A strategic plan was developed for the agency, which includes methodologies for facilitating the annual operating plans for the protected areas. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) share of this component reflects incremental costs for the administration of a protected area system, economically justified due to the competing land uses, and the basic needs of the relatively poor, rural population. The rationalization process involves the protection of the biodiversity heritage, and ecosystems, to provide sound basis for a sustainable tourism sector. The project will also ensure appropriate resettlement plans; 2) provide logistical support, equipment, and construction funds to establish new programs for environmental conservation education, to include a range of exhibits, and awareness campaigns, supporting biodiversity conservation; 3) provide training, management support, and technical capacity building, to enable the Wildlife Department implement its responsibilities under relevant international treaties, particularly to function s the management authority for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Moreover, a sustainable tourism framework will be established, based on policy development, and an enabling legislation; and, 4) provide moderate, operational funds, equipment, and civil works to continue the establishment of the Uganda Museums and Monument Agency, to facilitate its offerings expansion, and identify new antiquarian sites."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"27,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"JB,BC,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"80,76,82,83","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120111233922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120111233922","DocDate":"29-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201320391","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201320391","DocURL":"16-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201320895","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201320895","DocURL":"16-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201320794","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201320794","DocURL":"16-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201320593","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201320593","DocURL":"16-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02062204004960","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02062204004960","DocDate":"04-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01092804322244","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01092804322244","DocDate":"26-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02051404032673","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02051404032673","DocDate":"24-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01092804323045","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01092804323045","DocDate":"25-SEP-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
