The project consists of four components. First, the communications, policy research, and quality assurance component will provide support to develop a program to improve the institutional capabilities of the Supreme Court. Second, the caseload administration component will restructure the Court's internal organization, work practices and behavior, as well as administrative procedures to improve case-handling and preparation of decisions. Third, the Supreme Court's decision dissemination component will evaluate existing arrangements for publication of decisions, establish information kiosks, and train staff to develop publication capabilities. Fourth, the administrative and management support component will streamline organizational structure, computerize administrative support functions, institutionalize strategic planning, and develop monitoring and evaluation capabilities."},"country_namecode":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela!$!VE","sector1":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Access to law and justice","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"4,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"VE","sectorcode":"BG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Rule of law"],"themecode":"31,32","mjthemecode":"3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Access to law and justice","code":"31"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0208130402381","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0208130402381","DocDate":"28-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200350746","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200350746","DocURL":"30-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200350947","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200350947","DocURL":"30-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980217140241","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980217140241","DocDate":"09-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061711214859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061711214859","DocDate":"04-DEC-1996"}],"countryname":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela"}},"facets":{}}
