It will also strengthen the Government's efforts to improve operations and maintenance of urban infrastructure and services through manpower development and training programs.  More specifically, the project will:  (i) provide urban residential land and community facilities, expecially for poorer segments of the urban population; and (ii) provide long-term housing financing from the private sector to lower-income beneficiaries (owner occupiers who will choose the mode of construction).  Further, it will; (iii) strengthen institutions and streamline procedures through revised division of labor and responsibilities and among key public and private institutions operating in the urban sector.  To support this, extensive on-the-job training programs and technical assistance to central and local governments are included.  Finally, this project will improve urban transport."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zimbabwe!$!ZW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"43,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"ZW","sectorcode":"UH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban housing","code":"UH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007205024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007205024","DocDate":"23-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99ad9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99ad9_1_0","DocDate":"19-JUN-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zimbabwe"}},"facets":{}}
