It builds on the preceding DPOs and continues to support the implementation of CAR's poverty reduction strategy, as set out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper adopted by the Government in September 2007. The operation supports the Government's efforts to mitigate the economic and poverty impact of the global economic slowdown. The EMGRG III is designed as a two-tranche operation to give the authorities the time needed to implement the proposed tranche release conditions in the context of an evolving electoral process. The reform program has been developed jointly with the Government and in close collaboration with other donors active in CAR. Also the government and other budget support donors as a group have agreed on the EMGRG III tranche release conditions. The European Union and African Development Bank intend to provide parallel external financing to help mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis and support the implementation of the government's poverty reduction strategy. The operation is consistent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) supported program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)."},"country_namecode":"Central African Republic!$!CF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":44},"sector2":{"Name":"SME Finance","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":31},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":12},"totalcommamt":"8,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"SME Finance"},{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Implementation Status and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"CF","sectorcode":"LC,AT,LS,FH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,28,40,27","mjthemecode":"2,4,2,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"SME Finance","code":"FH"},{"name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","code":"LS"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":44},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":19},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":13},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":12},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20121214010656","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121214010656","DocDate":"30-NOV-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000356161_20120314003701","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120314003701","DocDate":"01-JAN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011012213340399","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011012213340399","DocDate":"22-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010102913401504","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010102913401504","DocDate":"09-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100908024543","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100908024543","DocDate":"26-AUG-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100830105633","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100830105633","DocDate":"24-AUG-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100901145027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100901145027","DocDate":"30-APR-2010"}],"countryname":"Central African Republic"}},"facets":{}}
