PIEQM is financed jointly by an IDA Credit (IDA047530) and Grant (TF097559) from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), formerly known as Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFAFTI). The closing date for IDA financing is June 30, 2015, and December 30, 2014 for the EFAFTI. In June 2013, the original closing date of the EFAFTI Grant (TF097559) was extended for one and a half years from June 30, 2013 to December 30, 2014. The Government of Malawi is now requesting for a second extension of the Grant for six months from December 30, 2014 to June 30, 2015. The proposed extension will facilitate the alignment of the EFAFTI and IDA closing dates and enable the achievement of the project objectives of improving education outcomes through increased access, equity and enhancement of quality of teaching and learning environment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":47},"sector2":{"Name":"Public
