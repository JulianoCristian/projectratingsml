Related objectives are to improve local capacity to allocate training resources as a function of labor market demand and to increase the involvement of the private sector in the management, provision and financing of VET. The project will finance three components: a) the consolidation of pre-service VET services, by upgrading facilities, revising curricula, improving teacher quality and increasing management capacity; b) the establishment of a Vocational Training Support Fund to develop demand-driven, employer-financed skills upgrading and apprenticeship training; and c) the establishment of an Employment and Training Observatory, to improve labor market information analysis and dissemination."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"13,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"ET,BC,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"51,71","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"9,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":78},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030708170734","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030708170734","DocDate":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121275206","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121275206","DocDate":"26-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121275206","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121275206","DocURL":"26-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23c49_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23c49_1_0","DocDate":"14-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961008084722","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008084722","DocDate":"15-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019180457","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019180457","DocDate":"15-FEB-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
