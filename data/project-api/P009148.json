The six project sections are located in three Republics: Bosnia-Hercegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia, and in the two Socialist Autonomous Provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. The section in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Sarajevo-Zonica, would be the first stage of a planned four-lane expressway linking the Central and Adriatic Highways, both of which were improved with a Bank financed loan (344-YU of 1963). The section in Montenegro, Bar-Ulcinj, would be an extension of the Adriatic Highway. It would replace an inadequate road and help the development of an attractive tourist area. The Belgrade-Novi Sad section, located mainly in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina and partly in Serbia, would be part of the international highway, London-Istanbul (E-5). The three remaining project sections, located partly in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and partly in the Republic of Serbia, would complete the upgrading of the Pec-Pristina-Nis road to higher standards. In total, the project works comprise the construction of 218 km of new or improved two-lane roads with paved surfaces. The proposed investments in the individual road sections would yield rates of return ranging from 14 to 29 percent."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912123857","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912123857","DocDate":"15-JUN-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903321720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903321720","DocDate":"31-MAY-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67f5c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67f5c_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAY-1970"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
