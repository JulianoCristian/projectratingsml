This objective will be achieved through three types of interventions: (i) prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment. The project has three components: (i) animal health, which concentrates on enhancing prevention and preparedness, strengthening disease surveillance and diagnostic capacity, strengthening control programs, improving biosecurity, providing support for surveillance o f migratory birds and establishing a contingency fund; (ii) public awareness and information, which is designed to safeguard human health, in particular for extension staff, animal health workers, poultry producers, poultry traders, poultry processors and other stakeholders dealing with poultry, by improving public awareness and information about the HPAI; and finally (iii) implementation support and monitoring & evaluation (M&E) component to provide financial and technical support for regular internal M&E of the Project as well as for an independent evaluation on a periodic basis."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration
