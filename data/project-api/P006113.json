It also includes various studies looking to future development. The Santa Isabel project is the largest single project in the expansion program. It would be located about 45 miles northeast of Cochabama and would consist of a 34 MW hydroelectric plant using tailrace water from the Corani plant, a 4 mile transmission line to connect at the Corani substation to the existing power system, and engineering services. The project would also include consulting services for DINE, for a limited period of time, to provide specialized assistance in the carrying out of its regulatory functions.
