This objective will be achieved through budget financing that will in turn support the GoES's policy and institutional reform. El Salvador has made significant progress in developing its natural disaster management program and strengthening its civil protection and disaster prevention and mitigation system. In recent years, the country has taken important steps toward implementing a sound disaster risk management framework, focusing on actions to mitigate natural disaster risks and lower the country's vulnerability in the context of the 'hyogo framework for action 2005-2015: building the resilience of nations and communities to disasters.' The program supports the millennium development goals by addressing disaster risk issues that affect the most vulnerable segments of the population."},"country_namecode":"Republic of El
