The needs of women involved in agriculture will be specifically addressed.  Subsidiary objectives are to: (a) make the technology transfer process more responsive to farmer needs; (b) improve the outreach capability of the extension service; (c) encourage the full participation of private sector seed companies in the supply of both food and cash crop seeds; and (d) remove restrictive seed regulations so as to provide farmer access to a complete range of imported improved crop varieties. Through a pilot component the project also aims at promoting agro-business opportunities to increase the production options for farming enterprises.  At the same time the project will support the compatible objective of improving the cost-effectiveness of public sector services.  These objectives will be achieved through:  (a) a program of on-farm demonstrations and farmer field days; (b) farmer-information media campaigns; (c) special Upazilla initiatives in technology development and transfer; (d) upgrading training; (e) expansion of the breeder seed operations and regulatory reform to improve seed industry efficiency; (f) technical assistance and institutional development; and (g) a pilot component for the development of horticultural export production among small farmers."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":63},"sector2":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":3},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":34},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"YA,AH,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"45,78,59,79,77","mjthemecode":"10,10,7,10,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":63},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":3},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":34}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000094946_03052904033565","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052904033565","DocDate":"06-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99031910560821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910560821","DocDate":"30-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123280239","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123280239","DocURL":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123280340","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123280340","DocURL":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123280239","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123280239","DocDate":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123280340","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123280340","DocDate":"17-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e371a1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e371a1_1_0","DocDate":"02-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930071408","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930071408","DocDate":"09-APR-1991"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
