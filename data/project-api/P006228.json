A consortium of consultants known as CANAMBRA, working under a United Nations Special Fund grant for which the Bank acts as Executing Agency, have studied the market for power in the region. These consultants have also prepared an emergency program of expansion, with which the Government is in accord, to meet power requirements through 1970. The Estreito and Xavantes developments, which together will provide additional generating capacity of almost 1 million kilowatts, are of high priority within this program. The Xavantes project has been under construction for several years."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"22,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912150982","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912150982","DocDate":"28-JUN-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903481258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903481258","DocDate":"28-FEB-1965"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6788b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6788b_1_0","DocDate":"26-FEB-1965"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67889_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67889_1_0","DocDate":"26-FEB-1965"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e67888_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67888_1_0","DocDate":"26-FEB-1965"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e67887_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67887_1_0","DocDate":"26-FEB-1965"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e67886_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67886_1_0","DocDate":"26-FEB-1965"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e67885_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67885_1_0","DocDate":"26-FEB-1965"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902482587","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902482587","DocDate":"17-FEB-1965"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
