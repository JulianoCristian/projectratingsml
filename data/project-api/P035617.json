The project has two components: a) Community development will include training for the community and for the NGOs recruited for community development activities; an information, Education, Communication (IEC) program tailored to community needs; and an information campaign to keep the public abreast of project development. b) Policy and institutional development will strengthen local and national decision-making on poverty issues. This component will finance the activities of the Observatory for Sustainable Human Development, created to provide policy-makers with information on poverty issues. This component will also support a permanent poverty monitoring system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":31},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":16},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":16},"sector5":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"21,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"TA,EZ,WZ,JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"53,57,51","mjthemecode":"6,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":31},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":21},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":16},{"Name":"Education","Percent":16},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040702134744","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040702134744","DocDate":"29-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200484617","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200484617","DocURL":"09-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200484919","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200484919","DocURL":"09-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110818","DocDate":"20-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903284046","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903284046","DocDate":"23-DEC-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
