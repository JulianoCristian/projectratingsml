Since the new units would utilize some facilities included in the first stage of the plant, the cost per kilowatt installed for this plant is $65. The unit cost for the total 300 MW installation would be about $158 per kilowatt. (B) Construction of the Canoas hydro plant, with one 50 MW unit. In addition to generating power, this plant will control the supply of water for the rest of the hydro generating system which is built in a series on a 25 km stretch of the Bogota River. The cost of this installed capacity is estimated at about $245 per kilowatt. (C) Expansion and improvement of transmission and distribution system facilities scheduled during the period 1968-1970 required to market the power to be generated by the planned addition to capacity. This also includes extension of street lighting facilities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"18,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912152384","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912152384","DocDate":"29-JUN-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67af9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67af9_1_0","DocDate":"03-JUN-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67af8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67af8_1_0","DocDate":"03-JUN-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903050382","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903050382","DocDate":"31-MAY-1968"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
