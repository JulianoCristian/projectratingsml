On completion of the project, the two rivers will be navigable year round with a minimum water depth of 1.7 m, which would help increase the low-cost barge traffic of bulk commodities. About 60-65 percent of all benefits will accrue from transport of rice and maize, the principal export produce of the project region covering 20 changwats and including about 11 million people. The coastal ports component consists of: (a) dredging the entrance channels of two of the more important ports, Bandon and Pattani; (b) technical assistance and procurement of a trailing hopper dredger; (c) geophysical and hydrographic studies to determine spoil dumping areas; and (d) consultancy services and training. Improvement of maintenance dredging capacity and procedures will benefit about 40 coastal ports and their hinterland where shipping and fishing remain principal economic activities."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"53,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925043319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925043319","DocDate":"22-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902355474","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902355474","DocDate":"30-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912494714","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912494714","DocDate":"30-JUN-1980"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
