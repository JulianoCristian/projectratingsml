This project is expected to have a significant positive impact on poverty reduction. First, through components designed to improve the business climate and private sector development, the project's operation will promote economic growth. Second, the strengthening of public financial management is expected to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public resources in the delivery of development services and in reaching the Bank's Millennium Development Goals. Third, this project supports equitable development through components emphasizing access to basic services, such as health, education, water and rural transport. The risks for this operation include: i) obstacles to the reform agenda; ii) weak capacity to implement the reforms; iii) vulnerability to commodity and currency rates; and iv) constraints to economic diversification. IDA is supporting the government of Benin in implementing measures to mitigate these risks by: supporting its consistent application of formal procedures and grounding reforms in participatory processes as well as in the dynamics laid out in the project's poverty reduction strategy paper; enhancing dialogue with the government of Benin, donor coordination and technical assistance; and improving the policy environment for private investment and infrastructure, diversifying agricultural product"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Quatri\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit d\u2019appui \u00e0 la strat\u00e9gie de r\u00e9duction \u00e0 la pauvret\u00e9</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>L\u2019objectif global du quatri\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit d\u2019appui \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 propos\u00e9 pour le B\u00e9nin est de contribuer \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de la DSRP de ce pays et d\u2019en r\u00e9aliser les objectifs, notamment de progresser vers la r\u00e9alisation des OMD.
