Its two main objectives are a) to maintain the momentum of the Government's educational rehabilitation efforts and ensure sustainability and b) to help prepare a sector credit for the implementation of an educational strategy.  For these purposes, the project will finance the procurement and distribution of instructional materials to primary schools requiring assistance and establish a revolving textbook fund on a limited pilot basis in order to test the possibility of a permanent replenishment of textbooks.  The project will further assist key departments / units in the Ministry of Education having an active role in the formulation and improvement of policies regarding instructional quality and project implementation. Finally, it will finance preinvestment studies and related activities for the preparation of a broad sector wide operation which will be identified and agreed upon during the implementation of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"22,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"EY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other education","code":"EY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019103651","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019103651","DocDate":"15-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120421759","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120421759","DocDate":"09-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120421759","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120421759","DocURL":"09-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08387_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08387_1_0","DocDate":"15-NOV-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927032601","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927032601","DocDate":"31-OCT-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927032448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927032448","DocDate":"19-OCT-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
