The project has three broad fronts: (i) improving the policy framework within AJK for the use of land resources; (ii) restructuring and strengthening the main institutions that help manage and protect the land resources in AJK; and (iii) testing, on a pilot basis, programs whereby communities take full responsibility for planning and implementation of activities covering land resources in the communities. Under (i) above, input production and distribution programs will be phased out through a program for transfer of these activities to the private sector. Associated with the transfer is a program for the phased elimination of subsidies on inputs. The specific activities for transfer and subsidy removal are production of vegetable seed, seed potato, fruit tree and forest tree seedling production; field crop seed, and fertilizer distribution and poultry vaccination. Changes will also be made to the current practices and policies that apply to community approaches to the management of communal lands. Under (ii), the project will restructure and streamline the Department of Agriculture (DOA), the Department of Animal Husbandry (DOAH), and the Department of Forestry (DOF). The effect of these measures is an overall net reduction in public sector staff. The Planning and Economic Services will be moderately expanded to enable analysis, planning, monitoring and evaluation. A Social Forestry Wing will be added to DOF to assist in community participatory approaches to management of communal lands, extension training, soil conservation and range management. AJK's Planning and Development Department will be supported by staff for environmental screening and "},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Central government
