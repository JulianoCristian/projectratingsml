The project will finance awareness, mass and community mobilization campaigns using Government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community based organizations (CBOs). It will finance targeted behavioral interventions and services aimed at high-risk groups through NGO and CBO programs. In particular, the project will finance the provision of condoms, care and treatment of STDs, including drugs and training of staff; and (2) mitigation of the personal impact of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The project will support community and home based health care and provide social support for people with AIDS. This will be accomplished through NGOs and CBOs at the district and community levels. The project will support the orientation of staff in dealing with opportunistic infections and will provide drugs for these infections. Also included are the provision of clinical and protective supplies. Tuberculosis is the most serious HIV related infection from a public health standpoint and the project will support the diagnosis and case management of tuberculosis; and (3) institutional development. The project will support the development of district and central capacity to plan and manage STD/AIDS programs. It will also support surveillance, operational research and monitoring and evaluation activities. Funds will also be provided for innovative NGO and CBO activities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":93},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":6},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"BZ,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,67,59,69,88","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":93},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":6},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20050721112537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050721112537","DocDate":"14-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030630103243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030630103243","DocDate":"23-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121214959","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121214959","DocDate":"03-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121215261","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121215261","DocDate":"03-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121215160","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121215160","DocDate":"03-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121214959","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121214959","DocURL":"03-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b372_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b372_1_0","DocDate":"12-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005165411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005165411","DocDate":"09-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005165723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005165723","DocDate":"09-MAR-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
