Reasons for project restructuring are: a) based on the experience with the implementation of the market over the last 2-3 years, TEIAS became aware of the need for significant operational support while the final market design is being implemented. ECSEE APL2 originally did not envisage any technical assistance (TA), and hence does not include a category on consulting services; b) the implementation of the electricity market has taken longer than originally anticipated, primarily because of delays in the approval of key aspects by the Government and Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA), and because certain aspects proved more complicated than initially expected. As a result, the implementation support being provided by the Balancing and Settlement System (BSS) consultants, currently financed under National Transmission Grid Project (NTGP), will need to continue for some more time. NTGP will close in December 2007, and the only feasible solution for continuing the BSS consulting services contract will be to carry on its financing under APL2; and c) in addition, several reviews by the independent panel of experts advising the Government on reform implementation have shown that significant capacity building will be necessary for the system and market operator. TEIAS has therefore identified training needs "},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition
