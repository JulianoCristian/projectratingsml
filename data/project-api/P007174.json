Land registration will provide land owners - particularly the vast majority of smallholders who lack clear tenure - with the security that will enable them to sell or rent at fair market prices, and pass on their holdings as inheritances. Improving tenure security will also increase smallholder access to credit, raising incentives to invest and to manage land properly. The project has two major components: 1) institutional strengthening and decentralization; and 2) land data acquisition, which includes three subcomponents: (a) mapping; (b) land records regularization; and (c) alternate dispute resolution mechanisms."},"country_namecode":"Republic of El Salvador!$!SV","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":7},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"SV","sectorcode":"BG,BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,75,83","mjthemecode":"11,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100722033120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100722033120","DocDate":"30-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20051221172057","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051221172057","DocDate":"12-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123100896","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123100896","DocURL":"11-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008074111","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008074111","DocDate":"31-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061411060431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061411060431","DocDate":"25-APR-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of El Salvador"}},"facets":{}}
