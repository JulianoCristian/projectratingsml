The project consists of four components. First, Agricultural Production Capacity Recovery and Regeneration Program will support strengthening the drainage and irrigation, and upgrading facilities in selected stations nationwide of the hydrometeorological network. Second, Potable Water Service Recovery and Restoration Program will finance restoring the complementary distribution and transmission facilities, and other drought mitigation measures, such as draining of wells and installation of water pumps. Third, Georgetown Flood Protection Program will support the rehabilitation of two main sluices and the installation of two supplementary pumps. The fourth component will finance the establishment of a project coordination unit."},"country_namecode":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana!$!GY","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":52},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Flood protection"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GY","sectorcode":"BC,WD,AI,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social protection and risk management","Urban development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,74,52,85","mjthemecode":"11,6,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":52},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":40},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":6},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02082304044625","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02082304044625","DocDate":"01-AUG-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201015425","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201015425","DocURL":"12-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201015224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201015224","DocDate":"12-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201014923","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201014923","DocURL":"12-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201015224","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201015224","DocURL":"12-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201015425","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201015425","DocDate":"12-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201014923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201014923","DocDate":"12-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000178830_98111703552999","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703552999","DocDate":"29-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101350","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101350","DocDate":"13-APR-1998"}],"countryname":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana"}},"facets":{}}
