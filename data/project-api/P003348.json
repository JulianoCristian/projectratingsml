It would replicate the Paddyland I Project. The project would develop and protect 125,000 acres of existing farmland and reclaim 50,000 acres of abandoned paddyland. Other components of the project include: equipment, spare parts and workshops, 1,000 small pumps and 1,050 power tillers, six fertilizer godowns, six training centers, extension services, 39 man-months of consulting services, and overseas training. The project would benefit 19,500 farm families, of which 5,000 are presently landless resident families. Annual incremental production, at full development, is estimated at 90,000 tons of rice, 2,000 tons of jute and 19,000 tons of pulses, groundnuts and other crops. Realization of project benefits would depend largely on the Government's setting prices at levels which provide farmers with sufficient incentives to use modern technology."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar!$!MM","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"34,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MM","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924184742","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924184742","DocDate":"17-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c1a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c1a_1_0","DocDate":"06-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902311829","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902311829","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912381512","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912381512","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar"}},"facets":{}}
