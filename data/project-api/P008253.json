This will be accomplished by upgrading primary and secondary facilities to minimum sanitary and physical standards, improving treatment skills of hospital physicians and nurses and building capacity at the central and district levels to manage health resources and implement sectoral reforms. The project consists of a main component to rehabilitate primary and secondary health services, and a complementary component to build institutional capacity at the district and central levels. The first main component will support: 1) rehabilitation and upgrading of 100 primary health centers out of an initial network of 200 in six pilot districts; 2) rehabilitation and upgrading of two secondary referral hospitals; 3) strengthened capacity to plan and implement a comprehensive public health facilities maintenance program (buildings and equipment) through development of maintenance norms and staff training. The second component will provide assistance to: 1) improve management of basic health services at the district level; 2) provide in-service training for hospital physicians and nurses; and 3) build institutional capacity at the central level to improve sector planning, health financing and drug distribution."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"12,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AL","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"67","mjthemecode":"8,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":85},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01120804004582","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01120804004582","DocDate":"02-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123343002","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123343002","DocDate":"16-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123343002","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123343002","DocURL":"16-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b432_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b432_1_0","DocDate":"08-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961007074826","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007074826","DocDate":"08-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006171627","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006171627","DocDate":"08-NOV-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Albania"}},"facets":{}}
