The program's goals are to expand the output of skilled workers and technicians and to improve the quality, relevance and efficiency of technical training. The project would include: facilities for training teachers, development of instructional materials, and program administration; constructing, or remodelling, and equipping of 99 technical training centers; and the preparation of CONALEP's 1984-1988 operations plan. The project would increase CONALEP's enrollment capacity by 50,000 student places and would provide equipment necessary for 70,000 trainees. At full development in 1985-86, the project is expected to add annually about 20,000 skilled workers to the labor force. It would also prepare annual 800 technical teachers, and upgrade specialized skills for 1,000 employed workers and technicians."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925082232","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925082232","DocDate":"01-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902380754","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902380754","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
