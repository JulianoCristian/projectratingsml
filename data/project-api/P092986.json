This paper seeks approval from the Country Director for a second-order restructuring plan for the project based on the results of the midterm review conducted in August 2009, and the slower than anticipated implementation pace thereafter. The restructuring will allow refocusing the activities on outstanding priorities, and improving overall project implementation performance. The closing date of the project, originally set for June 30, 2011, will be extended by 18 months, until December 30, 2012."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"General
