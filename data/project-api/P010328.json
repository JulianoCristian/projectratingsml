The project is designed to test the viability of an integrated private TW development program for increasing agricultural production. To achieve this objective, the project consists of: (i) a complete distribution network to extend electricity to about 8,000 tubewells, and infrastructure for the electrification of about 200 villages and 300 agroindustry units; (ii) improvement to watercourses; (iii) technical assistance to ensure adequate back-up for the implementing agencies and to provide training for the project staff; and (iv) engineering and office equipment. The installation of TWs will be financed by farmers by availing of funds from an ongoing agricultural credit program."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"34,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019204244","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019204244","DocDate":"15-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123245808","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123245808","DocURL":"28-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123245707","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123245707","DocURL":"28-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123245506","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123245506","DocURL":"28-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e07fa4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07fa4_1_0","DocDate":"11-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e07fa3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07fa3_1_0","DocDate":"11-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07fa1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07fa1_1_0","DocDate":"11-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927064014","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927064014","DocDate":"23-MAR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927064128","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927064128","DocDate":"23-MAR-1989"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
