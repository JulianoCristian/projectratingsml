It provides a part of DIB's foreign exchange requirements over 1985-87 for onlending to SMI, with special emphasis on small-scale industries (SSI).  It  also finances the foreign exchange cost of continuing the program of technical assistance to SMI begun under previous loans.  The project provides further support for the Governments' \"open-door\" policy.  By providing financial assistance to SMI, it contributes to the development of this important part of the private sector, while the technical assistance component increases the productivity and efficiency of SMI.  The project is expected to create about 71,000 new jobs."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"170,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"IL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","code":"IL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019122056","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019122056","DocDate":"21-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716150609","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716150609","DocDate":"30-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99b05_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99b05_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99b03_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99b03_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1984"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
