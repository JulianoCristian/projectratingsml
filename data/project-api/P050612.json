There are four project components. 1) Expansion of access to preschool and basic education will include construction of new classrooms and payment of teachers on a declining basis; develop an innovative initial education program with parent participation; and establish accelerated education modalities to meet the needs of over-age children in rural and marginal urban areas and expand alternative (multigrade) classrooms. 2) Quality improvements will support the revision of curriculum for initial and special education, basic education for adults, and accelerated programs to address the special needs of over-age students; review, design, and provide educational materials for teachers and students for all levels and modalities; strengthen teacher training programs; improve health and nutrition school programs; and provide infrastructure and furniture to schools. 3) Institutional strengthening and modernization will establish a financial planning and monitoring system; developing a sustainable system for on-going school-based management initiatives; and further develop communication strategies to increase public awareness of the basic education reform. 4) Project administration will finance operation costs, equipment, and office supplies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of El Salvador!$!SV","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":26},"sector2":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":24},"sector3":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":24},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"88,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"SV","sectorcode":"ET,JA,EP,EC,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Human development","Rural development","Human development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"53,68,78,65,71","mjthemecode":"9,8,10,8,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":26},{"Name":"Education","Percent":24},{"Name":"Education","Percent":24},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":13},{"Name":"Education","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20070430104652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20070430104652","DocDate":"15-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042211281622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042211281622","DocDate":"22-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2010031710411663","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010031710411663","DocURL":"04-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2010031710411663","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010031710411663","DocDate":"04-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061115554423","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061115554423","DocDate":"24-JUL-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980624085915","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624085915","DocDate":"14-APR-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of El Salvador"}},"facets":{}}
