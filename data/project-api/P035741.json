The project will focus on institutional strengthening, i.e., monitoring, licensing, and coastal zone management (CZM) and the identification and prioritization of environmental problems. It will strengthen decentralized environmental management at a State and municipal level through two components: 1) institutional strengthening and 2) environmental assets. The institutional strengthening component will support innovative activities to strengthen and improve licensing procedures at a state level; improve State-level water quality monitoring systems by financing the upgrading of existing monitoring systems or installing new monitoring systems in water basins where there are actual or potential conflicts in water use; and support CZM of up to 15 coastal states. 2) The environmental assets component will provide technical assistance to States to support a participatory process of priority-setting and the adoption of improved policies and other measures to achieve the priorities identified."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":89},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"26,82,73,85","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,9,11,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":89},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070209114400","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070209114400","DocDate":"15-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031611300654","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031611300654","DocDate":"28-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9912020606292","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9912020606292","DocDate":"11-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911050898","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911050898","DocDate":"04-MAR-1998"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
