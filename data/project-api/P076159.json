The three main components are: 1) construction and establishment of the Development Learning Center (CEDO), which will include facilities building comprising a videoconference room, computer rooms, technical and administrative centers, and, the installation of electrical, and telecommunication lines, in addition to satellite, telecommunication, and classroom equipments. This component has been financed by the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), so that distance learning activities could start immediately after project effectiveness; 2) support for CEDO's operation, by financing operating costs on a decreasing basis over the first three years of operation; and, by providing technical assistance for staff training, to conduct periodic evaluations on the Center's operation, and management, as well as for the establishment of financial accounts, and annual auditing; and, 3) monitoring and evaluation of CEDO's activities, and the pilot achievements and performance indicators, respectively."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"2,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BF","sectorcode":"BH,BC,EL,CT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"66,38,48","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"5,4,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":40},{"Name":"Education","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090729233309","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090729233309","DocDate":"05-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02070404010289","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02070404010289","DocDate":"14-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02020104020170","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02020104020170","DocDate":"23-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01122104033216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01122104033216","DocDate":"08-OCT-2001"}],"countryname":"Burkina Faso","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
