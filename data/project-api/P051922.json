RDSP was restructured to refine the results framework, reallocate the credit proceeds, modify procurement procedures, and extend the closing date. The project is currently under implementation and is performing satisfactorily. The extension is necessary to avoid the loss of International Development Association (IDA) funds that have remained inaccessible under OP/BP 7.30. The extension will also allow the closing date for the original credit to be aligned with the closing date for the additional financing. This will be the fourth extension of the closing date, for a cumulative period of 66 months. This extension will extend the closing date for the original credit beyond three years from the original closing date, but it is justified because the remaining IDA funds have remained inaccessible for more than two years due to external factors beyond the control of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Other social
