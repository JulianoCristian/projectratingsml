To that end, the project provides for (i) peri-urban plantations and pilot wood farms; (ii) farm forestry; and (iii) natural forest management and rehabilitation.  Furthermore, the project involves (iv) softwood plantation rehabilitation; (v) rehabilitation of the Forestry Department; and (vi) training.  Benefits from the project include increased production of (i) fuelwood and poles in both peri-urban and rural areas; and (ii) timber from both natural forests and softwood plantations.  The project will also result in fodder and fruit in rural areas; protection of unique flora and fauna in natural forests; conservation of the forest resource base; protection of the environment; more efficient utilization of wood; and easier access to wood production for consumers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"13,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060213210280","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060213210280","DocDate":"11-JAN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031011264881","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031011264881","DocDate":"06-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36c4f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36c4f_1_0","DocDate":"17-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36c4e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36c4e_1_0","DocDate":"17-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091521","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091521","DocDate":"31-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926034713","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926034713","DocDate":"27-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
