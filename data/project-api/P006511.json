The loan will accomplish these objectives by: (a) ensuring that BNDES continues to increase the proportion of lending to private sector borrowers in its total lending, and that its operations through financial intermediaries are undertaken increasingly and predominantly through private sector intermediaries; (b) supporting BNDES' reorganization which is designed to reduce BNDES' directed credit lines and to finance financially and economically sound projects; and (c) strengthening BNDES' credit, planning, and audit departments.  The project provides funds for civil works; inventories, machinery and equipment; and training and technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,43","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000090341_20030625111436","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030625111436","DocDate":"23-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019135509","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019135509","DocDate":"30-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042309542592","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042309542592","DocDate":"06-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041909552993","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041909552993","DocDate":"14-JAN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031611093594","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031611093594","DocDate":"14-JAN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929095147","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929095147","DocDate":"31-AUG-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929094950","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929094950","DocDate":"31-AUG-1990"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
