Of these, 170,000 families participating directly in the agricultural development components would increase their agricultural and livestock production on about 24,000 ha of the project area through the improvement and construction of irrigation systems, the provision of agricultural credit and intensive research and extension programs. The project would also include the rehabilitation of rural roads a forest plantation component for fuel and soil conservation, improvement of rural health facilities, construction of communal potable water systems, vocational training and preinvestment studies for a follow-up project. The principal risk confronting the project is its administrative complexity. To deal with this risk a Project Unit would be established in ORDEPUNO, the Puno Regional Development Organization, with operational control over most of the executing agencies. In addition, the project would be closely supervised by Bank staff and would receive substantial technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924225139","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924225139","DocDate":"29-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96121_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96121_1_0","DocDate":"18-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902343731","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902343731","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912480312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912480312","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
