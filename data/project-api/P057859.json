The components will: 1) formulate, and promote a participatory approach to policy dialogue, with public, and private stakeholders at the national, regional, and local levels, through workshops to formulate strategic tourism in the area, develop community participation, and institutional arrangements. A major land titling diagnostic on indigenous communities of the North Coast, should recommend actions to formalize recognition of indigenous land rights, as well as satisfactory conflict resolution. Technical assistance will be provided to promote, and implement policy reforms, legal and regulatory frameworks, and, improve institutional arrangements. This includes tourism audits, legal, and technical aspects related to titling of communal land, as well as campaigns focused on HIV/AIDS prevention, and control; 2) develop the capacity of coastal municipalities, which includes the private sector, and community based organizations, through skills training in environmental management, tourism management, and entrepreneurship. In addition, a cultural tourism site will be restored at the historic center of Trujillo; 3) design, and deliver micro, and small business enterprise training to stimulate productive capacity, and create business opportunities, i.e., handicrafts, tour operations, and adventures travel, and, 4) support project management, financial management, procurement, and reporting systems."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":37},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":29},"theme1":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Social Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"BC,BH,YW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"85,82,73,76,80","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,10,9,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":37},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":34},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":29}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060626130039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060626130039","DocDate":"20-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201242961","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201242961","DocURL":"22-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042313171320","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042313171320","DocDate":"30-SEP-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01081704011869","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01081704011869","DocDate":"09-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00100405321193","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00100405321193","DocDate":"11-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Social Assessment (SOA),  Vol.1","DocType":"SOA","EntityID":"000094946_01032206001888","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032206001888","DocDate":"31-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01032206191295","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032206191295","DocDate":"30-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01032705352346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032705352346","DocDate":"31-AUG-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
