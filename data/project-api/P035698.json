There are four components. The Leiyang Power Plant Component supplies and installs two additional anthracite-fired generating units to alleviate power shortages, improve the generation mix, and facilitate the retirement of 10 small, aging, inefficient, and polluting generating units in the provincial power grid. The second, the Transmission Component, reinforces the existing network and constructs transmission lines and a number of substations with line transfer capability. The third component comprises technical assistance for construction management, advisory services to help implement the electric power company's (HEPC) restructuring plan, and consulting services for HEPC's organization restructuring and improvement of its financial management system. The fourth component consists of a management development and training program designed to enhance HEPC's managerial, legal, technical, and financial capabilities."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u6e56\u5357\u7535\u529b\u53d1\u5c55\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u9879\u76ee\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u7684\u706b\u7535\u673a\u7ec4\uff1b\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e34\u754c\u8f93\u7535\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u6dd8\u6c70\u4e00\u6279\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u8001\u5316\u548c\u9020\u6210\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u673a\u7ec4\uff1b\u9632\u6b62\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u7535\u5382\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5de9\u56fa\u548c\u52a0\u5f3a\u7535\u529b\u4f9b\u5e94\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u73af\u4fdd\u3002\u8be5\u9879\u76ee\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53d1\u7535\u4e0e\u8f93\u3001\u914d\u7535\u5206\u5f00\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u8bbe\u7acb\u6bd4\u8f83\u6613\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5141\u8bb8\u8d2d\u4e70\u7535\u529b\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u62db\u6807\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u8f93\u3001\u914d\u7535\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u6e56\u5357\u7701\u5efa\u7acb\u8d77\u5b8c\u5168\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,84,81,78,44","mjthemecode":"4,10,11,11,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20060725154015","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20060725154015","DocDate":"29-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200375965","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200375965","DocURL":"07-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200380367","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200380367","DocURL":"07-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200380266","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200380266","DocURL":"07-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980630180445","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980630180445","DocDate":"21-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929094447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929094447","DocDate":"24-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980624164707","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624164707","DocDate":"28-FEB-1998"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
