As the changes do not affect the original project development objective which is to reduce urban poverty in a sustainable manner, targeting the poorest and most vulnerable sections of Salvador and strategic cities of the state of Bahia with access to basic services and improved housing and social support services - the restructuring is being processed as a level two restructuring
