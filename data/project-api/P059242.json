The project components follow. 1) Community investments will finance demand-driven sub-projects, proposed by the Common Interest Groups (CIGs), to be approved by the village development committees, and discussed by district sub-committees. Based on social assessments, it is expected that CIG subprojects will fall into three categories: a) skills and organizations, such as micro-enterprises; b) infrastructure, such as roads and housing; and, c) livelihood security, such as micro-irrigation. Village funds, established through community cash contributions would finance operation, and maintenance costs, and, Innovation Funds, would finance demonstration projects, proposed by non-governmental organizations. 2) Institutional, and human capacity building will develop self-reliant, and self managed community based organizations, focused on project administration, human resource development, communications, organization strengthening, and, monitoring and learning."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and
