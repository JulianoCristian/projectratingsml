The first phase will support improvements in water supply in the cities of Hangzhou, Ningbo and Wenzhou, land development in Shaoxing, environmental programs, institution building and traffic management in Hangzhou.  Water production will be increased by 620,000 cubic meters/day in three project cities.  More than 207 hectares of land area will be developed in Shaoxing to stem overcrowding and to provide expansion of industrial and commercial activities. The environmental programs consist of:  (a) a comprehensive liquid and solid waste management study, support to the provincial environmental agency and the detailed preparation of an environment project as a follow-up project; (b) a basic urban services upgrading component for the city of Ningbo; and (c) an environmental fund for pollution control investments to provide financial assistance to small- and medium-sized industrial enterprises.  The second phase will be a comprehensive environment project aimed at developing residential and industrial sewage collection and treatment systems, and improving on-site industrial wastewater
