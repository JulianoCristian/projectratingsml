Revision of the results framework was recommended during both the project mid-term review and the multi donor fund mid-term review. The implementing entities developed and are currently reporting against a revised results framework that is more logical, measurable and reflective of project objectives. The changes reflect the adjustments in activities, previously agreed by the World Bank, for delivering essential forest management and community livelihood activities. An expansion of project support to Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) during the final stage of project implementation had been initially envisaged and initial agreements had been obtained from the Aceh Forest and Environment Project (AFEP) steering committee, the provincial government, and the Ministry of Finance. There has been however a change of plans in September 2010 due to the fact that an external investor has offered to assist the Government of Aceh in REDD-related activities. All activities in the reallocation are in line with the original project development objectives. The reallocation of the resources administered by Fauna and Flora International (FFI) would enable to consolidate activities that are already part of the original project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Other environment
