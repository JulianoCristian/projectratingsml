A center for training in the management of health and family planning services will be established at a national level. RHCs constitute the cornerstone of the Iranian health care delivery system in rural areas. They provide comprehensive Primary Health Care (PHC) services and are essential to the development and operation of outreach services. The project will provide the necessary civil works, equipment and furniture, transport facilities, training and salaries to establish 623 RHCs in 14 provinces. The project will assist in rapidly expanding the Government's family planning program and strengthening its institutional base. Services will be provided through the primary health care network. The family planning component will have four parts: (1) diversifying the contraceptive method mix and expanding family planning services; (2) building the Ministry's institutional capacity at central and provincial levels to plan, manage and deliver family planning services; (3) developing information-education-communication capabilities to reach target groups; and (4) establishing a capacity for program evaluation and research in family planning through the use of specific studies. The project will examine the fee structure, the private sector role in tertiary care, and establishing a national medical insurance scheme."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Iran!$!IR","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"141,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IR","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Rural development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,78,67","mjthemecode":"8,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02070904062748","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02070904062748","DocDate":"17-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122574706","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122574706","DocURL":"31-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122574405","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122574405","DocDate":"31-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122574405","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122574405","DocURL":"31-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122574706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122574706","DocDate":"31-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004073549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004073549","DocDate":"05-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004073400","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004073400","DocDate":"05-MAR-1993"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Iran"}},"facets":{}}
