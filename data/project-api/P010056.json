The credit is expected to finance the installation of about 8,000 tubewells, and the purchase of over 5,000 tractors, together with various tractor implements and other farm machinery, as well as about 3,000 power tillers. As indicated in the Appraisal Report, the main part of the credit is expected to be channelled to West Pakistan. However, several other credits for East Pakistan are presently under consideration which would finance low lift pumps, tubewells and other irrigation requirements for the East Wing. To remedy the problem of lack of spare parts which, in the past, has caused less than optimum use of some tractors, the Government has agreed to license annual imports of tractor spare parts during the next two fiscal years, equal to at least 10% of the value of tractors imported in the preceding five years. Of the proposed credit, $2.3 million would be used to import spare parts for tractors financed under previous IDA credits."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912405029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912405029","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903161533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903161533","DocDate":"30-JUN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e8bb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e8bb_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e8b9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e8b9_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903194984","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903194984","DocDate":"12-JUN-1969"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
