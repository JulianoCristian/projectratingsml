The Government and HC will adopt policies and implement measures to: 1) maintain the road vehicle fuel tax on at least its present level in real terms; 2) reduce the Government's budgetary support to Croatian Railways (HZ); 3) design and implement a road traffic safety program; 4) reduce lead content in vehicle emissions and ensure wide availability of unleaded fuel at a price equal to or less than that of leaded gasoline; and 5) continue the separation of civil works contractors from HC and pursue further implementation of the Pavement Management System (PMS). Investments will include: 1) a three-year time slice of HC's road expenditure program directed at repairing war damage, reducing the deterioration of the network and making investments to complete projects that accommodate changes in transport demand; 2) technical assistance and studies for: HZ restructuring, traffic safety, implementation of PMS, and Rijeka port master plan; and 3) training for HC technical personnel in modernization road maintenance techniques, including pavement and bridge management systems."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Croatia!$!HR","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"HR","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,78,39,84","mjthemecode":"11,4,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20040416093237","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040416093237","DocDate":"30-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02010804013043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02010804013043","DocDate":"13-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200185180","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200185180","DocDate":"27-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200185180","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200185180","DocURL":"27-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3bf9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3bf9_1_0","DocDate":"20-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970311120907","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970311120907","DocDate":"15-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007051041","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007051041","DocDate":"15-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092132","DocDate":"29-FEB-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Croatia"}},"facets":{}}
