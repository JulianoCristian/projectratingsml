The proposed project would cover about 14,000 schools in Sind, Baluchistan and North West Frontier Provinces.  Quality improvement would be achieved by more effective in-service training and supervision of teachers, improved learning materials, the expanded use of assistant teachers, improved physical facilities, and greater community support.  The success of the proposed project will depend mainly on whether teachers can be influenced sufficiently to improve the quality of teaching. The project would adopt a new approach to teacher training through the development of integrated learning modules for teacher training and classroom use."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"52,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019111641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019111641","DocDate":"03-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e061a1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e061a1_1_0","DocDate":"06-JUN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0619f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0619f_1_0","DocDate":"06-JUN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101303","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101303","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094629","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
