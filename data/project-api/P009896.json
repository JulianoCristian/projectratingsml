In particular, the project will:  expand production of the offshore South Bassein gas field from 10 to 20 million cubic meters per day (MMCMD); support initial development of the Gandhar gas field, which will produce up to 3.5 MMCMD of gas; and eliminate flaring of about 1 MMCMD of associated gas at the offshore Heera oilfield, by linking it by pipeline to Bombay.  The project will also appraise the potential of the outlying Tapti and Hazira fields by seismic surveys for possible future additions to  India's gas supply and encourage optimal planning of gas production and utilization in India, through support for studies of the least-cost investments for field development and transmission infrastructure for the western region, and the uses of gas which yield the greatest economic benefit."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"295,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"GI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","code":"GI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008034050","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008034050","DocDate":"18-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926043604","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926043604","DocDate":"11-JAN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926043516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926043516","DocDate":"11-JAN-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
