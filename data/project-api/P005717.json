The targets of the project are to recruit about 30,000 new family planning acceptors per year in the public sector. Further reductions in mortality and morbidity will be addressed through: (a) reducing regional disparities in access to basic health care and in the availability of resources; and (b) improving the quality of basic health care (BHC) of which family planning/maternal and child health services (FP/MCH) is a critical component. The project will provide: (a) works and equipment to BHC facilities to accommodate the strengthening of FP/MCH services and upgrade the technical quality of the services; (b) mobile clinics and vehicles to deliver family planning and other basic health services with a strong focus on underserved areas; (c) ambulances and equipment for the district hospitals; (d) works and equipment for 5 peri-urban diagnostic centers; (e) educational materials and expert services for a comprehensive pre- and in-service training program for staff who are to deliver the services; (f) expert services to improve strategic planning and monitoring capacities; and (g) spare parts and expert services for the development of a maintenance program for vehicles, equipment and buildings."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"26,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Rural development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,78,67,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122435553","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122435553","DocURL":"22-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122435553","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122435553","DocDate":"22-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930055918","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930055918","DocDate":"19-FEB-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
