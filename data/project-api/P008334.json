Other objectives are to: a) restore the environmental role of coastal forests destroyed by the war, by protecting soil and water, and initiate the restoration of the natural vegetation; b) address the forest fire problem; and c) develop the knowledge base for improved management and protection of coastal forests.  The project, to be implemented over 5 years, will include the following 3 components: a) reconstruction of coastal forests, a nursery and an arboretum destroyed by war activities; b) forest fire management in coastal areas including a comprehensive package of prevention, presuppression, and suppression measures; and c) support services including the development of a geographic information system (GIS) for forest fire management, coastal forestry research, institutional support and project management and monitoring."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Croatia!$!HR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"42,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HR","sectorcode":"AT,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"80,86,76","mjthemecode":"10,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":90},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040107162312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040107162312","DocDate":"10-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229181741","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229181741","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200285789","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200285789","DocURL":"31-JAN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200285286","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200285286","DocDate":"31-JAN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200285789","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200285789","DocDate":"31-JAN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200285588","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200285588","DocURL":"31-JAN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200285286","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200285286","DocURL":"31-JAN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200285588","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200285588","DocDate":"31-JAN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970311113843","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970311113843","DocDate":"15-NOV-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Croatia"}},"facets":{}}
