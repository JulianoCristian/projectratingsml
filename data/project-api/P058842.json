The main components are: rehabilitation of rural roads and farm-to-market access roads, ensuring that provincial roads meet essential criteria and link to existing all-weather roads. Communal irrigation will be supported through improved management and schemes maintenance. Spring development projects will provide safe potable water to the communities, while water, sanitation, and health associations' management and institutional development will be strengthened; 2) the Community Funds for Agricultural Development will be established to address priorities of the communities. The funds will be provided initially, from loan proceeds, and municipal contributions, to support agricultural and fisheries development, particularly targeting, poor communities, specifically women, and indigenous groups; 3) institutional and implementation support, to strengthen local capacity of micro-finance institutions; enhancement of rural development planning, and resource allocation; and, financial management assistance; and 4) coastal bio-diversity conservation, whose incremental costs, will be financed by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the
