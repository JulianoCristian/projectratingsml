The project will address the major needs of upland areas: effective and affordable soil and moisture conservation measures, increased farm productivity, and institutional support for planning and implementing site-specific change.  The project will implement components on:  upland agricultural productivity and watershed stabilization; credit and grants for productive investment by upland hamlets and villages; road and bridge improvements; and institutional strengthening of relevant line agencies.  It will focus on better moisture retention and runoff control and more productive farming practices in microwatershed areas.  A project-supported research station that concentrates on upland agriculture will be established.  Concurrently, throughout Yogyakarta's upland villages, a menu of on-farm technology options will be demonstrated, more credit facilities will be provided, essential social services expanded, and in remote areas, village roads and bridges upgraded.  Using existing line agencies and staff, the project will provide extensive skills-based and managerial training support to all implementing agencies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":23},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":42},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"15,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BC,TA,JB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83,78,75,85","mjthemecode":"11,10,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":23},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":42},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980804142904","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980804142904","DocDate":"26-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122435251","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122435251","DocURL":"03-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122435251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122435251","DocDate":"03-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929154411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929154411","DocDate":"22-FEB-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
