By improving port operations and increasing port productivity through reduced congestion, cargo losses and handling costs, the project would provide more economical means of transporting major agricultural commodities produced in the hinterland to the project ports for domestic and foreign markets, and consumer goods shipped from Manila for distribution in the influence areas of the project ports. The resulting increase in commerce between the major domestic markets near Metropolitan Manila and the project ports is expected to stimulate the economy of port areas which are potential centers for future growth."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"67,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924233017","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924233017","DocDate":"30-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902352721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902352721","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e961c3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961c3_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e961c1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961c1_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912484999","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912484999","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
