These objectives would be accomplished through: (i) the rehabilitation of existing PETROPERU wells on the coast and the jungle; (ii) the undertaking of seismic surveys in the jungle and the updating of a feasibility study for a secondary recovery project on the north coast; and (iii) the provision of consultants' services and training to strengthen PETROPERU financially and technically and to study overall petroleum sector investment requirements and domestic pricing policies. The project faces no special risks. Technical assistance would be provided to PETROPERU under the project to train its personnel in the use and maintenance of equipment (also to be provided under the project) with which PETROPERU has not had previous experience."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"32,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"GI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","code":"GI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924224840","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924224840","DocDate":"30-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96112_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96112_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902342613","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902342613","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912474887","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912474887","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
