Technical objectives are to promote multipurpose use of groundwater resources and to develop least cost, appropriate technology that can be sustained by user groups with minimal public sector support.  Development areas have been identified in eleven provinces for the construction of: (a) some 1,900 intermediate technology tubewells to serve about 18,650 ha; and (b) some 240 deep tubewells to serve about 6,000 ha.  The project will finance all activities until tubewells schemes can be demonstrated to be in full operation after two years of operation and maintenance (O&M) support.  Major components include:  (a) survey, investigation and design; (b) construction of tubewell systems serving about 25,000 ha; (c) initial O&M support for two years after commissioning of tubewell systems; (d) provision of domestic water supply and house garden irrigation facilities; (e) agricultural development activities, including strengthening of extension services; (f) community support, including training and strengthening of Water User Associations and activities related to the role of women; and (g) institutional support for design, implementation, supervision and monitoring and evaluation of project performance.  The project will also strengthen groundwater monitoring."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"54,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"WC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,78","mjthemecode":"10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":97},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00081505321043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081505321043","DocDate":"23-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122575411","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122575411","DocURL":"26-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122575411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122575411","DocDate":"26-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003193153","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003193153","DocDate":"02-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003192854","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003192854","DocDate":"26-FEB-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
