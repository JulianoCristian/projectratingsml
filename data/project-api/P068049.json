The project consisted of four components: (i) Dongping, (ii) Najitan, (iii) Songshuling, and (iv) Xiaokou. Each of these components included: (1) construction of a small hydropower plant, (2) carrying out of a program of institutional strengthening, (3) development of a plan for enhancement of poverty alleviation efforts, and (4) compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation. In 2006, a fifth component, Guangrun Hydro power Development Project (Guanrun subproject), was added through a loan amendment to fully utilize the project saving. The civil works and the installation of the equipment for the fifth component are expected to be completed by the end of December 2011."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
