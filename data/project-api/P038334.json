The components will: 1) reduce Rajasthan State Electricity Board's (RSEB) technical, and non-technical losses through an immediate elimination of the long lower voltage, or low tension lines in rural areas, which heavily overload transformers. Schemes will be financed, consisting of low tension-less systems, replacing low voltage lines with high voltage, and further augment locations of distribution transformers, while capacitor installation will further improve returns of operating voltages; 2) reinforce transmission/distribution systems, by financing equipment, materials, and plant, for substations expansion/construction; 3) install system electronic (static) meters to measure the flow of electricity, a prerequisite for successful commercialization; and, 4) provide technical assistance in the areas of reform project management; institutional development; formation of joint venture distribution companies; socioeconomic impact assessment; renewable energy development; environmental management; and, communications/information, particularly supporting the public information campaign through various media forms."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
