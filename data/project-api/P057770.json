The components will: 1) provide resources for site planning, and analysis to formulate a conservation master plan at the Axum, and Gondar world heritage sites, and, finance the development of a series of pilot activities in architectural conservation, and archaeological consolidation; 2) develop the capacity of regional governments to effectively manage cultural resource assets, by establishing an information base aimed at planning, conservation, and threat mitigation. Workshops, and training initiatives will develop skills to implement inventory work, build professional capacity, and involve local organizations; 3) implement the preservation of ancient craft traditions, and re-establish craft making, as a vital part of community, and national economic life. Design guidance, technical skills, business understanding, and direct market links will be provided to generate local, and export products; and, 4) fund project management, i.e., the Project Coordination Unit - Expert staff, Accountant, Procurement, and monitoring and evaluation specialists, among others."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":36},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":36},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Resettlement Plan,Resettlement Plan,Resettlement Plan,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"BC,YZ,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,57","mjthemecode":"7,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":36},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":36},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20090602050559","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20090602050559","DocDate":"20-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000310607_20071207150312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20071207150312","DocDate":"18-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20041215104639","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20041215104639","DocDate":"01-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.2","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000160016_20041020163739","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20041020163739","DocDate":"04-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000160016_20041020161342","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20041020161342","DocDate":"01-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.3","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000160016_20041020164433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20041020164433","DocDate":"01-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022614005456","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022614005456","DocDate":"25-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02032004020812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02032004020812","DocDate":"05-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9903191105365","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903191105365","DocDate":"24-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02011104050913","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02011104050913","DocDate":"08-JAN-2002"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
