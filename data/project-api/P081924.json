The program comprises four components: (i) Financing of priority local investments; (ii) Support to community organizations (iii) Capacity enhancement for central and local governments; and (iv) Balance of payments support. The Project is  expected to assist Congo's stabilization and recovery process by: (i) contributing to improving living conditions in areas which to date have received limited external support and where poverty is  acute; (ii) helping strengthen civil society in rural areas and small towns; (iii) facilitating the decentralization process and the effective provision of basic social services outside Brazzaville and Pointe Noire; and (iv) helping maintain the pace of economic reforms. The main risks are the possibility of renewed violence in some areas, difficulties on the path to reform, and a compromised administrative capacity for implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Congo!$!CG","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"41,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Environmental Assessment,Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CG","sectorcode":"JA,EZ,WZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58","mjthemecode":"7,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":40},{"Name":"Education","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090722000737","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090722000737","DocDate":"26-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20080508045337","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080508045337","DocDate":"31-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20060316102842","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060316102842","DocDate":"01-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010050410072861","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050410072861","DocDate":"26-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20030618092358","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20030618092358","DocDate":"17-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000160016_20030605104326","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030605104326","DocDate":"02-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0304090402234","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0304090402234","DocDate":"29-MAR-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Congo"}},"facets":{}}
