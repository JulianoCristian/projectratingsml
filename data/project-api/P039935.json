The project consists of three interrelated components: 1) an investment component in the form of a line of credit to IL&FS; 2) a subproject preparation component, which will cover specialized consultancy services; and 3) a training and technical assistance component, which will include: (a) IL&FS's staff development for its staff; and (b) specific studies that IL&FS is undertaking to facilitate the evaluation and implementation of commercial infrastructure projects."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and
