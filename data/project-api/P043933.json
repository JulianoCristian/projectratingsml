The project consists of a comprehensive package of investments for five cities and comprises the following subcomponents: 1) water supply and wastewater systems development consisting of intercepting and linked sewers, outfalls from the sewers, secondary sewage construction, raw water transmission to treatment plants, treated water pumping stations, and distribution network improvements; 2) solid waste management consisting of funding operating equipment, and expanding and improving the existing landfills; 3) urban management information systems entailing creating new infrastructure, increasing operational efficiencies in existing infrastructure, and improving budgeting monitoring and management; 4) environmental protection including rehabilitating and improving access to cultural heritage sites, providing equipment for environmental monitoring, promotion, display, and adaptation of museums and historic sites; and 5) institutional strengthening and training."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
