There are four project components. The first 1) prepares planning documents and the consultative process for creating one new protected area and the permanent categorization of three existing reserved zones; 2) establishes protected area management committees; 3) creates a community-based and -managed protected area surveillance system; 4) trains indigenous community leaders in participatory methods; 5) implements a public awareness program; 6) builds and refurbishes facilities; 7) involves local staff and specialists; and 8) finances office, transportation, and communications equipment. The second component prepares management plans for titled indigenous land; technical studies and demand and market studies; and provides biodiversity investment sub-grants. The third component establishes a monitoring and evaluation unit at the central level and zonal levels and contracts for an analysis of the conservation and socioeconomic status of project areas and baseline information; develops biological and socio-economic databases and a geographical information system; prepares monitoring plans; and trains staff and local indigenous promoters."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":64},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":27},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"AZ,JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"86,57,60,80","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,7,7,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":64},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":27},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080307032236","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080307032236","DocDate":"19-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052111115803","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052111115803","DocDate":"07-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01020805385193","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01020805385193","DocDate":"19-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99112405314112","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99112405314112","DocDate":"04-NOV-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
