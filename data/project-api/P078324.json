The additional grant will help finance the costs associated with the scaling up and enhancing the impact of a well performing project. The focus of the additional financing is to expand the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) and related activities that will directly affect child and maternal mortality, especially in hard to reach and insecure areas. More specifically, the additional financing will be used to: (i) extend the current contracting with Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and the MOPH strengthening mechanism (MOPH-SM); (ii) strengthen the delivery of BPHS in insecure areas, particularly in Helmand; and (iii) support polio eradication and measles/ neo-natal tetanus control."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of
