The program provides support to the key reform measures included in the Third Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC 3) (report number P7316) and Energy Sector Adjustment Credit (ESAC). The project has four main components. The first component supports the establishment of a revolving hospital restructuring fund, whereby the proceeds from the sale of excess hospitals will be reinvested in the public sector health system. The second component addresses private sector development and the financial sector: it supports the open, competitive, and strategic privatization of a few large infrastructure enterprises by financing financial, legal, and technical advisory services; strengthens the capacity of the energy and infrastructure regulatory institutions to enable strong private sector participation; and strengthens the supervision department and monetary policy capacity of the national bank. The third component strengthens budget management, builds the institutional capacity of the finance ministry, improves the license regime, and supports the program of public information and public relations on economic reforms. The fourth component helps establish a credible and affordable safety net which includes pension reform as well as targeted assistance to the poor."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":9},"sector5":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"16,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"GE","sectorcode":"BG,BE,YZ,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Human development","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,33,40,67,43","mjthemecode":"4,8,4,3,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080704050537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080704050537","DocDate":"01-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201083503","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201083503","DocURL":"30-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99061606182329","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99061606182329","DocDate":"04-JUN-1999"}],"countryname":"Georgia"}},"facets":{}}
