There are five project components. The first helps create small, tubewell-based, irrigation perimeters; modernizes and rehabilitates existing perimeters; drains installations on irrigated perimeters; electrifies water sources and tubewells for potable water and/or irrigation in order to reduce energy and maintenance costs; creates water points in the southern arid zone; and works towards flood water management. The second component helps drill exploratory wells and piezometers, protects and rehabilitates existing ones; develops infrastructure for artificial groundwater recharge from available surface water; and pilots participatory management approaches. The third component monitors the quality and quantity of water resources; and protects the water resource base and soils. The fourth component provides potable water to rural dwellers. The fifth component helps develop new skills mainly oriented toward planning and demand management in the water sector while strengthening the agricultural ministry's (MOA) capacity regulation control and strategic planning. This component also finances a capacity-building effort for water user associations, nongovernmental organizations, and private entrepreneurs in the water sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":69},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"sector4":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"103,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Crops"}],"docty":"Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"AH,BC,WC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,26,85,25","mjthemecode":"2,11,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":69},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":26},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000334955_20081031045746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20081031045746","DocDate":"01-OCT-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080806002352","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080806002352","DocDate":"18-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200461715","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200461715","DocURL":"15-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00022905314129","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00022905314129","DocDate":"30-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20040722151901","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040722151901","DocDate":"10-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00061505312123","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00061505312123","DocDate":"10-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00080105321652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00080105321652","DocDate":"30-APR-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
