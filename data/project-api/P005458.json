It will also contribute to increased competition and efficiency in the financial sector. The project consists of eight lines of credit to financial intermediaries. Bank funds will support enterprises which are adapting well to the new industrial incentives environment and are financially sound. It will encourage export development, and in line with Government policy of fostering private investment, no more than 15 percent of Bank funds will be allocated to public sector projects. Bank funds will also be used to finance tourism projects and projects developed by leasing companies. Under the project, measures will be taken to: (a) strengthen the financial intermediaries and Morocco's institutional capabilities in relation to export promotion activities; and (b) ensure prompt and regular payment by the Treasury of foreign exchange losses due to the participation banks."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of
