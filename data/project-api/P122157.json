The program is the third and final phase of a three-year community living standards grant/credit development policy operation in Rwanda that is consistent with the second Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) theme. The operation supports GoR's poverty reduction objectives, consistent with the country's fiscal framework and the second strategic theme of the CAS, which is to reduce social vulnerability and - to ensure that the most vulnerable Rwandans also benefit from growth and to help Rwanda make further progress in building a more stable society. The operation supports policy reforms in the public works and direct support components of the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP) and helps Rwanda get on track with child and maternal mortality goals. It aims to achieve quick results in the areas of poverty reduction and improved health outcomes, even in the midst of the ongoing global economic and financial crisis."},"country_namecode":"Republic
