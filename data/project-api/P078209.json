The first component, construction and installation, entails setting up the DLC's institutional, physical, and human resources requirements, during the first year of the project, and prior to the start up of the DLC's operations (year 2-5). The Directorate of Personnel Management (DPM), Office of the President, is responsible for implementing this component under the leadership of a Project Coordinator. Construction of the DLC facility includes a video-conference room, computer room, a technical, and administrative center, as well as electrical/telephone installations. Additionally, equipment for a small aperture terminal VSAT satellite communication terminal, telecommunications, and microprocessor equipment will be supplied. The second component will assist DLC operations, and its financial viability, i.e., financing operational costs on a decreasing basis over the first four years of operation. Institutional arrangements will be established for the daily management of the DLC, with particular attention to the interaction between DPM and the DLC. This will become paramount in the preparation of a business plan, based on a market study, that identifies training needs, and capacity building, and, for the development of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan, to be submitted on annual, and quarterly basis. The third component will finance the processes involved in M&E training, and development plan, supported by consultants whose aim will be to promote an external independent asses"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"2,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Project Paper,Project Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"EV,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0007667643","geoLocName":"Lamu","latitude":"-2.28","longitude":"40.900002","country":"KE"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"66","mjthemecode":"8,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":70},{"Name":"Education","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20120810010444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120810010444","DocDate":"25-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20100630020000","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100630020000","DocDate":"28-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20100630021148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100630021148","DocDate":"25-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000020953_20071219091554","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20071219091554","DocDate":"19-OCT-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042116021367","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042116021367","DocDate":"10-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051415505764","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051415505764","DocDate":"10-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2005032309511965","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2005032309511965","DocDate":"10-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042115592666","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042115592666","DocDate":"10-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20031007144135","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20031007144135","DocDate":"26-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0207040401361","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0207040401361","DocDate":"03-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02081604133631","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02081604133631","DocDate":"26-JUN-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
