Specifically, it aims to strengthen institutions involved in the water supply subsector, establish cost recovery mechanisms  for safe water and support a program to rehabilitate rural water supply systems.  To this end, the project intends to provide (a) an institutional component with technical assistance and training, to reinforce the General Directorate of Water (GDW), as well as the communes and the users associations.  It also includes (b) a national program utilising \"line of credit financing\" for rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of existing rural water supply systems throughout the country. The first-year work program is expected to be ready about the time of credit effectiveness.  The communes will carry out the sub-projects pertaining to their communities, with assistance from local non-governmental organizations. Lastly, the project involves (c) specific investments for the rehabilitation and expansion of seven water supply systems in the Lava Region (North-West Rwanda).  Benefits under the proposed project are expected to result in improvements in the productivity and well-being of the rural population throughout Rwanda."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":72},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"BC,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,78,77","mjthemecode":"10,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":72},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042914241251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042914241251","DocDate":"01-AUG-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030912165252","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030912165252","DocDate":"14-AUG-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36890_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36890_1_0","DocDate":"28-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926051823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926051823","DocDate":"31-MAR-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda"}},"facets":{}}
