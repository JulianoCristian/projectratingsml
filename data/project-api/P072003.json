The focus of the project will be on further supporting selective cross-cutting themes, critical to improving service delivery, in particular, the public expenditure management reform, undertaken under the Public Expenditure Reform Adjustment Credit. Attention shall be given to three core sectors: rural water, health, and basic education. In addition to these three sectors, the project would support continuation on the implementation of the Environment and Urban Sanitation, and Forest Management programs, ensuring proper funding, execution and monitoring. While the programmatic approach should increase Benin's ownership of its development programs, strengthen budgetary institutions and reduce transactions costs in the delivery of external assistance, in addition to the promotion of inter-sectoral coordination, maximizing the impact on poverty reduction, risks could influence project outcomes. This entails the economy's vulnerability to falling cotton prices, which may hamper growth and significant reduction in poverty, in addition to the economic and political developments in Nigeria. Further risks are possible slippages in key reforms, weak institutional capacity; and, fiduciary risks. However, these risks have been mitigated by the strength of the Government's ownership and commitment to implement the proposed measures, and significant up-front actions."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":16},"theme5":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Environmental Assessment,Program Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"AT,WC,BC,EP,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"69,82,78,65,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8,10,11,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25},{"Name":"Education","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20080806025842","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080806025842","DocDate":"27-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060109103033","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060109103033","DocDate":"27-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"007743847_2007062016352747","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007743847_2007062016352747","DocDate":"15-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"007743847_2007062016352747","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007743847_2007062016352747","DocURL":"15-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20040315123930","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040315123930","DocDate":"27-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20040227103804","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040227103804","DocDate":"23-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000012009_20030917123940","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030917123940","DocDate":"04-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03081304004723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03081304004723","DocDate":"11-AUG-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
