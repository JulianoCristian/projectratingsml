Th project would immediately benefit some 19,800 smallholder families in the first two provinces and, through estate development in the other, set the stage for additional smallholder investments at a later time. It also includes technical assistance to the Directorate General of Estates and the participating estates, a training component and provision for developing and initiating implementation of future nucleus estates and smallholder investments. There are no unusual technical risks in this project. In order to address potential weaknesses in management of the various estates the project includes effective measures to speed up implementation and improve project management, therefore minimizing this risk."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"161,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924230956","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924230956","DocDate":"02-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925073039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925073039","DocDate":"13-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190237432","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190237432","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912532679","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912532679","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
