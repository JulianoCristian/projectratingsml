The project includes management assistance to be provided by the agricultural Finance Company (AFC) and a private company, East African Acceptances (EAA) with technical assistance also provided by the Ministry of Agriculture. A large-scale farm study, project evaluation and preparation of subsequent phases would also be included. AFC would have specific responsibility for project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095307","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095307","DocDate":"04-JUN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dec94d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dec94d_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAR-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dec94b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dec94b_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAR-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e726cf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e726cf_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAR-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b7ba_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b7ba_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAR-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b7b8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b7b8_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAR-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901153983","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901153983","DocDate":"28-FEB-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902232914","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902232914","DocDate":"28-FEB-1975"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
