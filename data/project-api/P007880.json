The project would provide about 16,000 farmers and rural workers with basic and intermediate skills courses in agricultural techniques and artisan occupations over a six-year period. A fund would be established to provide credit for equipment, tools and working capital to graduates of the intermediate skills training program. The project would strengthen SNPP's capacity to conduct rural training and improve its ability to coordinate and integrate its training program with rural activities being implemented by other government agencies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Paraguay!$!PY","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PY","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006173930","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006173930","DocDate":"14-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a7e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a7e_1_0","DocDate":"03-JAN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101907","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101907","DocDate":"31-DEC-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Paraguay"}},"facets":{}}
