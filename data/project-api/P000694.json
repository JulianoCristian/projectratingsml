The project will comprise a three year phase (1981 to 1984) of the Plan's investment program. It will build upon the educational development provided under earlier IDA-assisted education projects and will: (i) expand primary, secondary (lower and higher) and non-formal education; (ii) strengthen maintenance programs for educational facilities; (iii) expand educational support services at the district level; (iv) help reorient curricula towards practical work and studies; (v) help establish a school of veterinary medicine, and (vi) help evaluate educational methodology and the supply and demand for manpower. The project will raise enrollment ratios significantly at all levels, particularly in rural areas, and help to adjust the imbalance in the geographical distribution of schools."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925055030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925055030","DocDate":"28-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e042b4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e042b4_1_0","DocDate":"14-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902295590","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902295590","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
