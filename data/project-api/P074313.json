The PRSC2 project will help improve poverty reduction efforts, by strengthening public expenditure management and the effectiveness of service delivery. The line ministries are expected to become more responsible and efficient in budget formulation and execution. However, many risks exist, but the main risk is the economy's vulnerability to a further drop in cotton prices and/or cotton production; but, ongoing discussions with the Government and the other donors to accelerate reform of the cotton sector, should reduce this risk and make the sector more sustainable."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":16},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"WC,JA,AH,EZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Human development","Human development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,67,65,27,77","mjthemecode":"10,2,8,8,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20080806025842","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080806025842","DocDate":"27-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010030111251961","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111251961","DocDate":"06-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010030111251961","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111251961","DocURL":"06-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050524103413","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050524103413","DocDate":"16-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000012009_20050421160600","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050421160600","DocDate":"19-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000012009_20050420085905","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050420085905","DocDate":"01-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050111112119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050111112119","DocDate":"15-DEC-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin"}},"facets":{}}
