The components will: 1) enable the establishment of a regulatory framework, in compliance with the National Environment Management Plan, to support the enforcement of the Environmental Law. The component will develop a long-term vision for the environmental management of the petroleum sector. Studies will assess institutional capacity, and provide adequate alternatives for the sector; 2) strengthen the technical coordination of field interventions : health, biophysical, and socioeconomic impact management. Liaison with sponsors will be ensured, and, training will be provided to institutional staff, in coordination with counterparts in Chad, to maximize synergies; 3) support implementation of the environmental management plan, and, the improvement of skills, responsiveness to oil spills, and, capacity building within the decentralized services of the Cameroon Authority; and 4) monitor, and evaluate project management, through an International Advisory Panel, who will compile information on performance indicators, and evaluate activities under sound environmental management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cameroon!$!CM","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"5,770,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Investigation Report,Investigation Report,Credit Agreement,Executive Director's Statement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CM","sectorcode":"LC,JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Human development","Rule of law","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,82,33,88,84","mjthemecode":"11,8,3,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":35},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080806023917","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080806023917","DocDate":"25-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Investigation Report (INVR),  Vol.1","DocType":"INVR","EntityID":"000265513_20040520095916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000265513_20040520095916","DocDate":"28-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Investigation Report (INVR),  Vol.1","DocType":"INVR","EntityID":"000160016_20030730143707","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030730143707","DocDate":"28-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123570318","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123570318","DocURL":"14-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Executive Director's Statement (Executive Director's Statement),  Vol.1","DocType":"Executive Director's Statement","EntityID":"000016351_20140411153353","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000016351_20140411153353","DocDate":"22-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00042505301946","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00042505301946","DocDate":"30-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20050727115821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050727115821","DocDate":"30-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99061205324392","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99061205324392","DocDate":"27-OCT-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cameroon"}},"facets":{}}
