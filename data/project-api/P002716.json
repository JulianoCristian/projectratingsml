The mill would use locally grown cotton and imported polyester and rayon, and the project output would represent about 11% of Tanzania's projected total fabric production in the mid-1980s. The project includes provision for financing of technical assistance to TEXCO, and a training component. The project faces no substantial risks with regard to technical, marketing and pricing aspects. The management risk would be minimized with the involvement of experienced international firms during implementation and initial operations of the project, and a training program has been designed to ensure availability of trained manpower."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924185235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924185235","DocDate":"31-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902311423","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902311423","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e368_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e368_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e367_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e367_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e364_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e364_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfcfdd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfcfdd_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfcfdb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfcfdb_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912380595","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912380595","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
