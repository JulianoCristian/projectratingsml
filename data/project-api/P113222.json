The grant will help finance the costs associated with urgent procurement and distribution of fertilizer for irrigated rice production. Irrigated rice is the only crop that can respond effectively to soil fertilization at this period of the cropping season and which can rapidly increase food availability. The support will also benefit the Food Crisis Coordination Unit (CCA) in the Prime Minister's office, which is the permanent secretariat for the national Food Crisis Prevention and Management Framework (FCPMF), and other national bodies involved in the FCPMF, by providing technical assistance to strengthen monitoring of the food security situation and to prepare and implement social safety nets programs. Project preparation and implementation are coordinated with the Joint Government-Donor Food Crisis Committee (CRC) which oversees the CCA. Net sales revenues of fertilizers will be used to strengthen social safety nets programs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Niger!$!NE","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Niger : Projet d\u2019urgence d\u2019appui \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alimentaire</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Ce rapport traite des perspectives de d\u00e9sarmement et du rapatriement de trois groupes arm\u00e9s pr\u00e9sents en R\u00e9publique d\u00e9mocratique du Congo (RDC)\u00a0: les Forces d\u00e9mocratiques de lib\u00e9ration du Rwanda (FDLR), les Forces nationales de lib\u00e9ration (FNL) du Burundi et les Allied Democratic Forces/National Army for Liberation (ADF/NALU) de l\u2019Ouganda.
