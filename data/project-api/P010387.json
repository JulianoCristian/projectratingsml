It will cover the incremental costs associated with the program. It will be national in scope, but with an emphasis on specific districts where maternal and infant mortality rates are higher than the national average. It will be co-financed by UNICEF and take into account its experience in assisting the Government of India in implementing the Universal Immunization Program during the seventh five-year plan (1985-90). Its specific objectives will be to enhance child survival, prevent maternal mortality and morbidity, and increase the effectiveness of service delivery. These objectives will be achieved through supporting: (a) Child Survival Programs; (b) Safe Motherhood Initiatives; and, (c) Institutional Systems Development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"214,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,63","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145529","DocDate":"03-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123292388","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123292388","DocURL":"20-FEB-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123292388","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123292388","DocDate":"20-FEB-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123292589","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123292589","DocDate":"20-FEB-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123292589","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123292589","DocURL":"20-FEB-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e38ee7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e38ee7_1_0","DocDate":"17-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001185804","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001185804","DocDate":"27-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001185450","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001185450","DocDate":"27-AUG-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
