The project will improve the beneficiaries' standards of living, incomes, and employment opportunities. It will support water resource development for both production and consumption, adaptive agricultural research and rural extension, rural investment credit, marketing services, funding for community sub-projects, and state project coordination. The Northeast Rural Development Program-Sergipe Project will also provide support for regional program administration and regional agricultural research and research coordination. The regional activities will assist in the implementation of rural development projects in all ten Northeast states, thereby benefitting an estimated 600,000 farm families expected to be reached during the first five-year phase of the Northeast Rural Development Program."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":15},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":42},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":30},"sector5":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"61,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"WC,BH,YZ,AZ,FZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,51,75,85","mjthemecode":"11,10,6,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":42},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170809","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170809","DocDate":"20-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171414","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171414","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171155","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171155","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
