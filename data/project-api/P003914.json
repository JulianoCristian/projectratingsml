This will be accomplished by: (a) building provincial and kabupaten capacity to plan, implement and evaluate safe motherhood, child survival and nutrition interventions; and (b) by strengthening the capacity of the central Ministry of Health. The Provincial Service Delivery and Capacity Development component consists of interventions in safe motherhood, child survival nutrition and health education. Selected kabupaten in each province will implement newly designed approaches to each intervention which will be evaluated by kabupaten and provincial staff prior to expansion to additional kabupaten within each province. A central support services and capacity building component will help the Directorate General for Community Health, the Center for Health Education and the Center for Health Data to build their capacities for policy development, provision of technical assistance to local levels, organization and monitoring of training, and for conducting surveys and operational research."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"93,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Urban development","Rural development","Human development"],"themecode":"63,78,71,69,68","mjthemecode":"8,8,9,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0201170402131","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0201170402131","DocDate":"19-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122562950","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122562950","DocURL":"21-JAN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122562749","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122562749","DocDate":"21-JAN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122562950","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122562950","DocDate":"21-JAN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003150352","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003150352","DocDate":"04-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003150114","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003150114","DocDate":"04-DEC-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
