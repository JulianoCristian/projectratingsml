The project would provide 500 primary school classrooms and 31 new, replacement or upgraded junior secondary schools, especially in rural areas where school facilities are often inadequate and overcrowded, besides textbooks and library books. Through the financing of two new vocational training centers and an industrial trade testing center, the project would provide timely support for the establishment of a national program of apprenticeship training and trades testing with which most of the major agencies and private enterprises will progressively be involved."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Botswana!$!BW","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"26,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BW","sectorcode":"ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925232553","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925232553","DocDate":"18-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094042","DocDate":"30-NOV-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095304","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095304","DocDate":"30-NOV-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Botswana"}},"facets":{}}
