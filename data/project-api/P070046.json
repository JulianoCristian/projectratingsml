The project consists of a technical assistance (TA) component to prepare an energy sector study. The study would have thirteen modules as follows: 1) develop a household energy survey to evaluate feasibility, and costs of alternative energy sources; 2) determine production capability of existing power generating facilities, and identify options for future power generating capacity; 3) prepare alternative programs for rehabilitation, and expansion of the power transmission system, and analyze least-cost power generation investments to determine expansion plans; 4) analyze technical losses in power transmission, and distribution, to propose immediate long-term measures on loss reduction targets, and costs; 5) evaluate the feasibility of a new System Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), and associated telecommunications facilities for power system dispatching; 6) prioritize investment requirements in distribution capacity; 7) propose a lignite mine development strategy for supply to existing thermal power stations; 8) evaluate the current state of district heating facilities, and compare competitiveness with other heating options; 9) investigate the technical, and economic feasibility of importing natural gas to Kosovo, estimating gas demand, and required pipeline infrastructure; 10) estimate future demand for petroleum products; 11) based on the above modules, prepare recommendations on investment plans for power and energy sub-sectors; 12) estimate economic costs of electricity, and tariff structures, based on least-cost generation/transmission programs;"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kosovo!$!XK","sector1":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"2,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"XK","sectorcode":"LZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58","mjthemecode":"7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20030616152021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030616152021","DocDate":"11-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0011080538348","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0011080538348","DocDate":"13-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051316352085","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051316352085","DocDate":"25-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01052604004841","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01052604004841","DocDate":"23-APR-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kosovo"}},"facets":{}}
