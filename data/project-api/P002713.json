It will significantly raise smallholder incomes and increase Tanzania's foreign exchange earnings. Specifically, the project will finance bulking bags, grading/baling centers, marketing centers, vehicles and related maintenance equipment, storage warehouses and ancillary facilities, and incremental staff and technical assistance for TAT. The project faces no special risk. While implementation could proceed at a slower rate than anticipated as a result of institutional deficiencies, this risk has been minimized through the provision of technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"14,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904163651","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904163651","DocDate":"29-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904163652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904163652","DocDate":"27-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902304878","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902304878","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228bc2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228bc2_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912374868","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912374868","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
