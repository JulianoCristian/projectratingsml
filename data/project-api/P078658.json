The DRC was caught in a vicious cycle of poor governance, poverty, and violent conflict throughout the 1990s. Since 2000, considerable progress has been made to restore peace and security, but the situation remains very volatile in North and South kivu. The 2006 democratic elections of the President, Parliament, and provincial authorities now present a unique window of opportunity for the World Bank to support the DRC in consolidating and expanding peace and development gains while attenuating the risk of renewed conflict. In order to address the urgency of the maintaining peace in the country's eastern regions, the Government has asked the association to provide for the possibility of retroactive financing that corresponds to its counterpart requirement under the African Development Bank parallel project. The proceeds of the additional financing will be used to support the following activities which were included as part of the original Project: (a) demobilization of combatants; (b) reinsertion support to newly demobilized ex combatants; (c) reintegration support for demobilized ex-combatants; (d) release of children from armed forces; and (e) specialized support for disabled ex-combatants."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of the Congo!$!ZR","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Other
