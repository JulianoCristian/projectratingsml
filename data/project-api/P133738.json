This program document provides a second DPL in the amount of United States (U.S.) 340 million dollars to the Republic of Guatemala. This operation complements efforts of other development partners, and builds on lessons learned and progress achieved under previous World Bank operations. It helps consolidate a set of cross-sectorial policies intended to support a more efficient delivery of quality public services. At the same time, this operation aims to establish a foundation for progress in the medium- to long-term. In particular, new initiatives include enhancements to the organizational structure of the tax administration superintendence (superintendencia de la administracion tributaria, SAT), the creation of a department of international taxation within the ministry of finance (ministerio de finanzas publicas, MINFIN), and mandating the use of the single treasury account and the integrated financial management system (SIAF) for all budgetary transactions, thereby increasing the transparency and monitoring of public spending. In addition, to enhance its policy dialogue, the World Bank Group is engaged in a series of analytical and advisory activities in support of envisaged reforms in this DPL in the areas of economic governance, poverty and equity monitoring, and competitiveness."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guatemala!$!GT","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":71},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":29},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":43},"theme3":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"340,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Board Summary,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"GT","sectorcode":"JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Human development","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"55,68,28,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,8,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":71},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":29}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Summary (SU),  Vol.1","DocType":"SU","EntityID":"000333037_20140620105148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20140620105148","DocDate":"17-JUN-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000442464_20140515094259","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20140515094259","DocDate":"05-MAY-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000414397_20140428181623","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000414397_20140428181623","DocDate":"24-APR-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000414397_20140407175328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000414397_20140407175328","DocDate":"13-MAR-2014"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guatemala","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
