This operation is the first of a second series of three PRSC designed to support the implementation of the Government's poverty reduction strategy. This second series aims to strengthen public financial management and improve access to basic social services, while enhancing the regulatory and institutional framework for infrastructure and private investment. The reform program supported under this series continues and deepens the agenda introduced by the first series (PRSC 1 and 2), with an increased focus on social service delivery, particularly from the second operation. The reform policies supported by this new series are embedded in and aligned with Mali's Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (GPRSF). The design of the series benefited from consultations with various stakeholders. The consultations were made under the Government's leadership, including in coordination with a group of donors who provide budget support to Mali for the GPRSF implementation. These consultations ensure Government ownership of the supported policies and harmonize donors around a common set of key reforms. The lessons learned from the implementation of the PRSC 1 and 2 were also taken into account in the design of this follow-up series."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":38},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":16},"sector4":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":11},"theme3":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"65,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"WC,AH,YZ,JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Human development","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,77,70,49,39","mjthemecode":"4,5,8,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":38},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":22},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":16},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":12},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20120712020456","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120712020456","DocDate":"29-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2009100509274736","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009100509274736","DocDate":"30-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2009100509274736","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009100509274736","DocURL":"30-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20090505033438","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090505033438","DocDate":"28-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000013944_20090414142253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000013944_20090414142253","DocDate":"24-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090210155246","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090210155246","DocDate":"15-JAN-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
