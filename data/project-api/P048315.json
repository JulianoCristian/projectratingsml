For this purpose, the components will: 1) reinforce the institutional capacity of the Directorate General of Forestry, and the Ministry of Environment, for a sustainable protected areas management. Training, technical assistance (TA), and scientific studies will support a strong regional focus on modules targeting park management personnel, and potential partners - nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector - in a management participatory approach; 2) manage and restore unique, and distinct ecosystems (wetlands, arid mountains, savanna, and desert) in the three national parks (Ichkeul, Bouhedma, and Jbil), assist in the development of eco-tourism activities, and, establish community development plans, compatible with the objectives of sustainable biodiversity conservation. Management plans will emphasize on technical aspects - inventory, infrastructure, surveillance - and on strategic issues, such as participatory reviews, and assessment of practices by local communities, in addition to scientific monitoring in the sustainable use of natural resources; and, 3) build public support for biodiversity conservation, targeting priority groups, including that of specific stakeholders, through delivery mechanisms such as mass media, formal and informal education, and, through the development of linkages with local NGOs, schools, and other organizations."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":61},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"5,330,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Resettlement Plan,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"EZ,BC,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"80,45,82","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,5,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":61},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":29},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20091020232447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091020232447","DocDate":"25-AUG-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052615253006","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052615253006","DocDate":"18-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20040804124915","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040804124915","DocDate":"06-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0206120401370","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0206120401370","DocDate":"04-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_02032305092930","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02032305092930","DocDate":"14-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02032104054447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02032104054447","DocDate":"14-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0103300600544","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0103300600544","DocDate":"23-DEC-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
