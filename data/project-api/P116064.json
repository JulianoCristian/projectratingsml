The grant will help finance the costs associated with the provision of seed and fertilizer to 50,000 small farmers, aimed at directly increasing their cereal production during the long rains planting season which started in late March 2009. The objective of the project is to assist the recipient to increase access to agricultural inputs and technologies among targeted small holder farmers in the six main producing districts: Eldoret East, Eldoret West, Wareng, Trans Nzoia East, Trans Nzoia West, and Kwanza Districts. This improved farmer access is expected to contribute to higher yields, household food self-sufficiency and the generation o f surpluses for sale, as well as reduced gap between domestic production and consumption in 2009. The Bank's strategy for emergency support will be focused on improving the immediate to medium-term supply of food produced and available in the country. The World Bank is intensifying its long term support to agricultural productivity."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Kenya : Programme de fourniture d\u2019intrants agricoles</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Ce Projet d\u2019approvisionnement en intrants agricoles est financ\u00e9 dans le cadre du Programme mondial de riposte \u00e0 la crise alimentaire (GFRP), qui \u00e9t\u00e9 valid\u00e9 par le Conseil des Administrateurs le 29 mai 2008.
