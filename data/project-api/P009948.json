The project seeks to accomplish this through (a) the addition of 270 MW of hydro capacity on the Kalinadi River; (b) rehabilitation of the Sharavathi Power Station; and (c) reinforcement of the State's transmission system. In addition, the project intends to provide consulting services, computer hardware, software and training.  There are no extraordinary technical risks associated with the project.  Geological investigations have confirmed generally good rock formation in the area of the hydro schemes.  KPC and KEB have staff familiar with works similar to those included in the proposed project and consulting support will be provided in those areas in which the beneficiaries lack experience."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"330,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019171227","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019171227","DocDate":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926070506","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926070506","DocDate":"13-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
