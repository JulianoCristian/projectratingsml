The principal components are: (a) the reconstruction of Kosovo Junction; (b) the installation of modern signaling and telecommunications on the Lesak-Djeneral Jankovic main line; (c) the procurement of rolling stock and integrated transport equipment; and (d) training and technical assistance to improve management, planning and freight operations. The main project objectives are to improve RTO Pristina's management and operational capabilities in order: (a) to improve the capacity and efficiency of the Kosovo rail network; and (b) to facilitate the development and exploitation of Kosovo's abundant mineral resources which generate long distance bulk traffic, thereby accelerating the economic growth of the less developed Kosovo region."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"34,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925063813","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925063813","DocDate":"28-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902372458","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902372458","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97650_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97650_1_0","DocDate":"28-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e9764f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9764f_1_0","DocDate":"28-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912521970","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912521970","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
