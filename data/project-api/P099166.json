More specifically, the proposed credit aims to enhance the Government's ability to accelerate economic growth and improve the efficiency of its social programs and public administration - key elements in poverty reduction. To this end, the proposed PRSC will support selective areas of the Government's reform agenda, as outlined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the European Union (EU)-Moldova action plan, thereby complementing and reinforcing other Bank Group programs in Moldova, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-supported Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) and other donor activities. Closely aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the PRSC will support the EGPRSP objectives of: Improving the Investment Climate; Improving the Efficiency and Management of Public Resources; and Strengthening Pension and Social Assistance Systems."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"}],"docty":"Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MD","sectorcode":"BE,AZ,YA,YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,49,25,27,77","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,2,2,5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":34},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":33},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":11},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":11},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"007336079_2007061910470479","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007336079_2007061910470479","DocURL":"22-DEC-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"007336079_2007061910470479","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007336079_2007061910470479","DocDate":"22-DEC-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000090341_20060927134712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060927134712","DocDate":"20-SEP-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20060329092456","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20060329092456","DocDate":"28-MAR-2006"}],"countryname":"Republic of Moldova","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
