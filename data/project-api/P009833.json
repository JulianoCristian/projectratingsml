It would further; (ii) strengthen the linkages between extension and research in these States, and broaden the scope of the project to cover such other activities as water and soil management, farm management, horticulture as well as some aspects of farm forestry.  It would also; (iii) introduce the T&V system of extension in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.  Field extension staff tend to be subject to outside pressures, particularly from local government authorities to carry out non-extension work, thus detracting from extension effectiveness.  This risk would be mitigated under the proposed project by ensuring that all incremental extension staff would work exclusively on agricultural extension.  The provision of training for a large number of professional staff in diverse technical subjects would present a challenge.  It would be met through the state training components under the proposed project, supported by the Extension Training Unit of the Directorate of Extension."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"49,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007154843","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007154843","DocDate":"25-OCT-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135930","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135930","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904162441","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904162441","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e0612d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0612d_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0612b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0612b_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAR-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
