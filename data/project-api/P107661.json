The additional financing of US$500 million is also an International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan, and will bring the total BOS-KITA financing to US$1.1billion. The additional loan will reimburse a portion of the Government's BOS grants made to public and private primary and junior secondary schools under the auspices of the Ministry of National Education (MoNE) for the BOS 2010 program and the BOS 2011 and later Program, and undertake activities that will enhance the implementation of BOS-KITA, and help 'scale up' the project's development effectiveness. While the strong fiduciary arrangements will be continued (as per the original BOS-KITA loan), the  activities will, in addition, (i) support school based management practices more directly; and (ii) strengthen the role and responsibilities of local governments for the BOS program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Primary
