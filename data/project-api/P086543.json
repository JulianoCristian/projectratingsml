These would support a solid economic recovery in the medium-term, that would pave the way for sustained higher growth rates, a return to positive per capita economic growth, and significant poverty reduction. This single-tranche loan supports the presentation to Congress of a budget consistent with attaining a primary surplus for 2004, and financial sector reforms to reduce the fiscal liabilities associated with poor banking resolution practices, and deposit guarantee schemes. The operation also backs the presentation to Congress of major reforms in the tax system, in the public sector pension scheme, and in the customs code, and, supports numerous actions in improving public sector administration, including, but not limited to, the implementation of the newly regulated public procurement law; censuses of public sector employees, and of the contributors and beneficiaries of the public pension scheme; and, the adoption of a financial management action plan to enhance transparency, and strengthen audit, and independent review functions. Nevertheless, a key risk is the absence of a track record in implementing high-quality reforms. The government's reform strategy is an ambitious one, with major reforms to be approved by Congress within a short period of time. Efforts to tackle corruption, and increase efficiency in the public sector figure prominently in this strategy, and could ignite resistance and unrest, possibly resulting in a retreat from, or dilution of, the reform agenda. Mitigating these risks are the new administration's concerted efforts to reach a wide-ranging political consensus for its reform program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Paraguay!$!PY","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"PY","sectorcode":"FA,BE,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,28,25,21,29","mjthemecode":"2,1,2,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":75},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050722162915","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050722162915","DocDate":"27-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202205395","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202205395","DocURL":"16-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202204994","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202204994","DocDate":"16-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202204994","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202204994","DocURL":"16-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202205395","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202205395","DocDate":"16-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20031217101814","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20031217101814","DocDate":"02-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20031124144401","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20031124144401","DocDate":"11-NOV-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Paraguay"}},"facets":{}}
