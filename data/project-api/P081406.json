A well-functioning wholesale electricity market is an integral component of Romania's strategy to attract and sustain private sector participation in power sector renewal, especially for the refurbishment o f power distribution and generation assets, and to develop a more efficient and increasingly competitive power sector. There are two main project components. The project will be implemented by Transelectrica (Romania's grid company and power system operator), OPCOM (\"Operator Commercial,\" the subsidiary of the national power company and Romania's power market operator),  and ANRE (the regulatory agency for electricity and heat). The first component, the investment component, rehabilitates the Iernut substation and Fundeni Substation, and finances engineering and supervision consulting services. The second component , the technical assistance component, 1) designs and implements the regulatory framework (commercial code, market rules, and price-caps for network services) for the new Electricity Trading Platform; 2) designs, pilot tests, and implements the new Electricity Trading Platform through the OPCOM Power Exchange; and 3) provides institutional support to Transelectrica."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"82,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Environmental Assessment,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Working Paper,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"47,40","mjthemecode":"4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090601235448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090601235448","DocDate":"22-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000310607_20080620094556","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20080620094556","DocDate":"18-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20060830120950","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060830120950","DocDate":"30-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202200769","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202200769","DocURL":"15-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202200870","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202200870","DocDate":"15-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202200769","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202200769","DocDate":"15-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202200870","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202200870","DocURL":"15-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Working Paper (WP),  Vol.1","DocType":"WP","EntityID":"000333038_20081118003335","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081118003335","DocDate":"14-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20030527120217","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030527120217","DocDate":"20-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03042304090896","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03042304090896","DocDate":"15-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03041504034614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03041504034614","DocDate":"15-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03031904081153","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03031904081153","DocDate":"31-MAR-2003"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
