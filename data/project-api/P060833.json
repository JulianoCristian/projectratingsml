The program comprises three phases, the first of which, installs a strategic process for sustainable performance improvement (2000-2004), Five main components are described here. The first and central component, performance improvement, decentralizes and expands key government ministries, departments, and agencies; establishes a core group of strategic planners; trains ministries and build their capacities to implement their plans; strengthens their performance orientation; and provides incentives for performance. The second component obtains private sector participation by continuing the transfer of functions, services, and operations from one institution to another; contracting out non-critical services; divesting and privatizing services and facilities; and redeploying surplus staff. The third component creates and operationalizes executive agencies, isolates select non-policy and executing functions, and introduces client orientation and results-oriented management. The fourth component modernizes information and communication systems, and introduces an integrated computerized personnel and payroll system. The fifth component helps the public service system transform into a meritocracy by developing leadership and management skills, reinstating ethical conduct, and mainstreaming gender issues in to public service activities."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"41,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"29,25,30","mjthemecode":"2,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000442464_20130917103717","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130917103717","DocDate":"09-SEP-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20080805053538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080805053538","DocDate":"12-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2010031011110371","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031011110371","DocURL":"20-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99120105303184","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99120105303184","DocDate":"30-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99060411032828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99060411032828","DocDate":"14-MAY-1999"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
