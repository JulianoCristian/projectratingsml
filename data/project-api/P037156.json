The project design and implementation arrangements respond to the Government's request for the Banks support, to help achieve universal salt iodization by end 1996, and thereby virtually eliminate IDD in China by the year 2000. The Banks support to the project is thus seen as an emergency measure to enable the Government to address a major public health problem in the country. The Government has undertaken to carry out other components of the NIDDEP with its own resources as well as with assistance with other UN agencies. Within this framework of shared responsibilities for international assistance the Bank has agreed to support the salt iodization activities."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
