The project would provide civil works, furniture, equipment, specialist services, fellowships, and other related inputs to: (a) increase the number of graduates and the volume of research work at 26 leading universities; (b) raise the quality of graduates and research work at these universities; and (c) strengthen management at universities and the Ministry of Education. Since this would be China's first operation with the World Bank Group, delays in implementation might result from the Borrower's inexperience with Bank procedures. To help reduce this risk, the Bank and UNDP have assisted the Borrower in preparing specifications and tender documents. Furthermore, the project would strengthen the capacity of universities and the Ministry of Education to implement and manage future development projects."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u5927\u5b66\u53d1\u5c55\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925074025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925074025","DocDate":"31-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902375936","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902375936","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191253393","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191253393","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e042f8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e042f8_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e042f7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e042f7_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1981"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
