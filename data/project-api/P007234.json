Under the project, 6,000 families, of which 98% fall below the poverty line, would benefit directly. Increased production of rice and food crops on about 75,500 acres of cultivated land would be achieved through rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation and drainage systems, and roads and on-farm development and improvement of agricultural supporting services. The project includes establishing new pumping plants, enlargement of main canals and distributaries, construction of rice drying and storage facilities, supply of farm machinery and maintenance equipment, applied research, seed production, training of extension agents and farmers, establishment of an extension service, and consultant services for design and construction of civil works and for strengthening agricultural development."},"country_namecode":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana!$!GY","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GY","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912213960","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912213960","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190231033","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190231033","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana"}},"facets":{}}
