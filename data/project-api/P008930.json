It comprises a 173 metres high, concrete arch-gravity dam which will create 5.62 km3 live storage reservoir (9.6 km3 total storage) on the Euphrates river, a power house containing six 200 MW turbo-generator units and appropriate accessory equipment. It also includes resettlement of population, estimated at 17,000 living in 34 villages, and relocation of existing railway lines (33 kms), roads (35 kms) and two bridges. In addition to help meeting growing power demand in Turkey, the project, together with the exisiting Keban dam (16.3 km3 of live storage) will result in a better regulation of Euphrates river-flows, thereby benefitting power and irrigation projects downstream. The project faces no special risks, although realization of benefits will depend heavily on adequate and timely coordination of activities during project implementation, including adequate financing."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924231852","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924231852","DocDate":"24-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924231801","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924231801","DocDate":"27-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96196_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96196_1_0","DocDate":"15-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190235174","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190235174","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912485617","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912485617","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
