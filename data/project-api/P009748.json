Possible risks facing the Thal Fertilizer Project are in the form of technical problems, implementation delays and cost over-runs. These risks are minimized by the use of commercially proven technologies supplied by internationally recognized engineering firms and by the use of the services of the Fertilizer (Planning and Development) India Ltd. and RCF staff who are experienced in building and commissioning similar plants. Potential risks associated with the timely availability of required infrastructural facilities will be reduced by the Government of Maharashtra's confirmation that these would be provided and arrangements made for monitoring the execution of this work."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"IC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","code":"IC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3961006145938","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006145938","DocDate":"17-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902333092","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902333092","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191239141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191239141","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e95e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e95e_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e95b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e95b_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUN-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
