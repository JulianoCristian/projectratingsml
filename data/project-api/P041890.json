The project will support the development of infrastructure, services, and institutions in the cities of Shenyang, Fushun, and Anshan. In Shenyang, the project will augment the existing urban road network through the construction of additional capacity in the principal east-west corridors, provide additional crossings of the railways lines, provide exclusive bus lanes, and strengthen local capacity for the management of urban transport operations and services through studies, technical assistance, and training. In Fushun, the project will finance the construction of the Hunhenan Corridor, the provision of bus priority facilities and non-motorized vehicle exclusive roads, and support studies, technical assistance, and training. In Anshan, the project will finance the reconstruction of the main north-south corridor and the construction of an interchange between the primary north-south and east-west corridors. The project will also support the development of selected sector institutions in the three cities."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
