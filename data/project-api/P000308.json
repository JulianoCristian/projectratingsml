To this end, the project will support policies and investments designed to support the implementation of the Government's population policy by improving quality of, and access to, family planning (FP) and maternal and child health care services nationwide; promoting information, education, and communication programs in the areas of population, FP and women's rights; and strengthening institutions in charge of implementing the national population policy and of planning, managing and evaluating FP programs. The project will also strengthen the national capacity to contain the spread of HIV, Acquired Immune-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), STDs by strengthening the institution in charge of implementing the national AIDS program and the health system's capacity to deal with AIDS needs; promoting safer health practices and behavioral change through information, education, and communications campaigns; promoting the use of condoms; treating STDs; and strengthening clinical management and community care. Finally, the project will encourage private sector and non-governmental organizations participation in population, FP and HIV/AIDS/STD programs by establishing a fund to provide grant financing for projects in those areas."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":71},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":16},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"26,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BF","sectorcode":"JB,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,69,88","mjthemecode":"8,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":71},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":16},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02032704034150","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02032704034150","DocDate":"13-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121223480","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121223480","DocURL":"08-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121223480","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121223480","DocDate":"08-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121222579","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121222579","DocDate":"08-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121222579","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121222579","DocURL":"08-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121223981","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121223981","DocURL":"08-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121223981","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121223981","DocDate":"08-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b3b3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b3b3_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006004624","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006004624","DocDate":"31-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006004321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006004321","DocDate":"31-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"Burkina Faso"}},"facets":{}}
