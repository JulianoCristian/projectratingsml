It will:  (a) strengthen the National Federation of Central African Livestock Producers (FNEC) to further develop its input delivery and pastoral organization and to increase the number of herder associations.  It will also; (b) assist the Livestock Service (LS) in its vaccination campaigns against the main epidemic diseases; the reorganization and strengthening of its extension, research and pastoral settlement activities; and the restructuring of its personnel and financial organization to sustain these activities on a long-term basis. Finally, the project will; (c) rehabilitate feeder roads in the Livestock Communities to improve the herders access to markets; and (d) reinforce management capabilities during project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Central African Republic!$!CF","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CF","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961219123216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219123216","DocDate":"13-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006194716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006194716","DocDate":"27-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36b33_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36b33_1_0","DocDate":"15-APR-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36b31_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36b31_1_0","DocDate":"15-APR-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092347","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092347","DocDate":"31-MAR-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165259","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165259","DocDate":"31-MAR-1986"}],"countryname":"Central African Republic"}},"facets":{}}
