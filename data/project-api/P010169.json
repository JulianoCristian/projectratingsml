The objectives of the project are to increase agricultural production by providing a more reliable irrigation water supply and reducing crop losses resulting from flooding; provide a more equitable irrigation water supply to all farmers by increasing deliveries to watercourses in the tail reaches of minors and distributaries through a program of silt removal in these reaches; strengthen Provincial Departments of Irrigation's operation and maintenance programs to improve the efficiency of the system and assure the continued maintenance of installed facilities; and serve as a model for a larger and continuing program of a similar nature.
