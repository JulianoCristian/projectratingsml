The project consists of two complete single cycle gas turbine power plants rated at about 110 MW each, burning light distillate fuel oil.  The plants will consist of the following fully integrated components: 1) main equipment (gas turbine and generator sets and auxiliaries, air inlet, exhaust gas systems, including stacks, electrical equipment, power plant control system, high voltage switch gear and unit transformers, enclosures and light structure buildings); 2) auxiliary systems (fuel supply system, demineralized water supply, water supply for extinguishing system, fire detection and protection system, telecommunications and remote and indication systems); 3) civil works (site preparation, leveling, earthwork, foundations, roads and fences, site improvements, cable and piping channels and trenches); and 4) network and infrastructure (telecommunications link)."},"country_namecode":"Hungary!$!HU","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"HU","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39","mjthemecode":"4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00030305393291","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00030305393291","DocDate":"10-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172238","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172238","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040610273444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040610273444","DocDate":"02-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042011324142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042011324142","DocDate":"02-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102237","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102237","DocDate":"31-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171343","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171343","DocDate":"30-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171342","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171342","DocDate":"30-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171344","DocDate":"30-JUN-1996"}],"countryname":"Hungary"}},"facets":{}}
