The project will include the following components: (i) road rehabilitation will support the provincial rehabilitation and maintenance program from 2007-2010 under the Eleventh Five Year Program (EFYP). The Bank contribution will help finance eligible investments under the rehabilitation component of the program. A list of 18 segments to be rehabilitated, for about 890 km, has been evaluated and found acceptable in the context of the province-wide program of the road network rehabilitation; (ii) road improvement or upgrading of about 320 km of key provincial and national roads located on the Central-Eastern and Southeastern areas of the Province. These improvements or upgrades will include in some cases the duplication of existing roads following the same alignment with specific bypasses in built-up areas (in order to minimize resettlement actions) or with short segments of new alignments if necessary to avoid difficult topographical conditions; (iii) road maintenance by contract Anhui Provincial Communications Department (APCD) will implement maintenance by contract approach in at least two highway segments of the provincial highway network for a cumulative number of 120 kilometers by the end of the project; and (iv) institutional strengthening program includes the provision of improved tools for road management (technical, environmental, and economic) and a training program."},"country_namecode":"People's
