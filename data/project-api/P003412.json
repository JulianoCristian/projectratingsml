Principal features of the project would be drainage works; larger and more modern agricultural machinery for full mechanization of farming operations; construction equipment; and provision of roads, housing and supporting infrastructure. Training in equipment operation and maintenance and in construction techniques would be provided together with technical assistance (78 man-months of consultant services) in the fields of planning, training, and seed production. The project would produce more than 440,000 tons of grain and soybean annually, and thereby help reduce China's food grain deficit. It would serve as a large-scale trial and demonstration of techniques applicable to an additional 470,000 ha of uncultivated land and some 2 million ha now cultivated by state farms in Heilongjiang."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u519c\u57a6\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5728\u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u7701\u5f00\u53d120\u4e07\u516c\u9877\u672a\u5f00\u57a6\u5730\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u98df\u7cae\u548c\u5927\u8c46\u751f\u4ea7\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u8d44\u52a9\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u5305\u62ec\u6392\u6c34\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u519c\u4e1a\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5927\u578b\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u519c\u4e1a\u673a\u68b0\u3001\u65bd\u5de5\u8bbe\u5907\u4ee5\u53ca\u9053\u8def\u3001\u4f4f\u623f\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u65bd\u5efa\u8bbe\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bbe\u5907\u8fd0\u884c\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u65bd\u5de5\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u57f9\u8bad\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u751f\u4ea7\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6280\u672f\u63f4\u52a9\uff08\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e78\u4e2a\u4eba\u6708\u7684\u54a8\u8be2\u670d\u52a1\uff09\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u6bcf\u5e74\u5c06\u751f\u4ea7\u8d85\u8fc744\u4e07\u5428\u7cae\u98df\u548c\u5927\u8c46\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u4e3b\u98df\u7cae\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5bf9\u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u7701\u53e6\u591647\u4e07\u516c\u9877\u672a\u8015\u5730\u548c\u76ee\u524d\u6709\u56fd\u8425\u519c\u573a\u8015\u79cd\u7684200\u4e07\u516c\u9877\u5de6\u53f3\u519c\u7530\u9002\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bd5\u70b9\u548c\u793a\u8303\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"80,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97481_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97481_1_0","DocDate":"19-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e058ee_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e058ee_1_0","DocDate":"19-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902414289","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902414289","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901003035","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901003035","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
