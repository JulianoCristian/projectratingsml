The project components fall under four major groups: 1) the bulk of Madagascar's Utility for Electricity and Water's (JIRAMA) investment program which will finance the rehabilitation and extension of generation, transmission and distribution facilities, the provision of tools and equipment for maintenance, a loss reduction program, improvements in human resources management and personnel training, a program for information technology, and feasibility studies for two small hydroelectric projects; 2) a program under the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) responsibility to increase access of peri-urban and dynamic rural areas to the electricity service; 3) actions in support of the institutional reform of the power sector; and 4) a program for energy efficiency dealing mainly with the woodfuels sub-sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"46,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Renewable energy"},{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MG","sectorcode":"LA,LE,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"40,39,74,84,78","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"10,11,9,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"},{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":75},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":17},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20061002105753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061002105753","DocDate":"27-SEP-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121281017","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121281017","DocURL":"29-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121281017","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121281017","DocDate":"29-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121280816","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121280816","DocURL":"29-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121280816","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121280816","DocDate":"29-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000386194_20120905032448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120905032448","DocDate":"14-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022112518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022112518","DocDate":"14-MAR-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Madagascar","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
