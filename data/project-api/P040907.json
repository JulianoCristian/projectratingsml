The project components are: 1) Assistance provision to the Ulaanbaatar Electricity Distribution Office (UBEDO) for the improvement of its power distribution systems, revenue collection, and commercialization aspects. Investments in technical loss reduction include the installation of distribution transformers, mid-voltage set-ups, and, installation of low-voltage lines. Based on international commercial standards, non-technical loss reduction will be accomplished by installing new meters - to be controlled by UBEDO - which includes metering of residential customers in the Ger area, in apartments owned by former housing companies, and commercial, and industrial customers. Technical assistance (TA), and capacity building for commercialization will include management practices, energy economics, and technical skills. 2) TA, training, and technical services will improve electricity distribution in the provinces (\"aimags\") through the installation, and reconfiguration of meters, and connections, and of various low-voltage lines; pipeline replacements, installation of pumps in canal sections, and, the installation of heat meters will improve heat distribution systems. 3) Regulatory support, and financial management to the Energy Authority will be provided in the form of staff training to develop institutional capacity, and, through the introduction of an independent external auditor, to provide international best practices in financial management."},"country_namecode":"Mongolia!$!MN","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":49},"sector2":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of
