It will continue to develop FIRA's institutional framework for efficient allocation of financial resources and assist to improve agricultural policies through the reduction of interest rate subsidies.  The low-income producers' component will comprise about one-half of the total investment program.  A program of training and demonstration will provide support to credit operations.   About 105,000 families or 580,000 beneficiaries will benefit from the project."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925205309","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925205309","DocDate":"25-JUL-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925002357","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925002357","DocDate":"29-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99afc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99afc_1_0","DocDate":"27-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99afa_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99afa_1_0","DocDate":"27-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e99af9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99af9_1_0","DocDate":"27-JUN-1984"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
