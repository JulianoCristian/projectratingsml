A second aim is to establish a center of excellence in the region for distance learning and exchange of information and experience. The project has two main components. The first component consists of building facilities on the site of the National School of Administration (ENAM) to establish the Distance Learning Center (DLC); to provide a video-conference room with a 30-person capacity, a computer room outfitted for 30 computer stations (hardware, software, and Internet hook-up), a technical and administrative center, and installation and/or upgrading of electrical and telephone wiring. It also includes purchase and installation of a Very Small Aperture terminal (VSAT) (satellite communication terminal), video, telecommunications, and microprocessor equipment, office and classroom furniture, and various other equipment for DLC operation and security. The second component helps the DLC become operational and financially viable. It finances DLC costs on a decreasing basis over the first three years of operation; purchases a vehicle; and supplies technical assistance for training, periodic evaluation of operation and management effectiveness, and financial accounts and their annual audits."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"2,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Telecommunications"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"CT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"48,57,66,39","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,8,7,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050217134912","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050217134912","DocDate":"28-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022615142873","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022615142873","DocDate":"05-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042116294074","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042116294074","DocDate":"05-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00081406033021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081406033021","DocDate":"08-JUN-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
