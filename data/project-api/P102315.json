The original closing date for the project is June 30, 2011. It is will be extended to June 30, 2012. Delays in project implementation were encountered in the set up phase of the Sudan microfinance development facility. Project implementation was further hampered by the fact that the microfinance sector in Sudan is relatively nascent and the weak capacity of personnel in the microfinance sector in Sudan. All funds have been committed to various activities related to sub-projects for technical assistance, loans and equity. This extension will enable the project to fully disburse the allocated funding for the project and allow the project the come closer to achieving its development objectives. The project extension will also give us an opportunity to continue to seek a broader policy discussion with the authorities on the microfinance sector in Sudan."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Sudan!$!SD","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":45},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"SD","sectorcode":"FE,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rule of law"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"36,41","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":55},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":45}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081c059bd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c059bd_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAY-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b0818646f6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0818646f6_1_0","DocDate":"06-JAN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000386194_20120808003300","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120808003300","DocDate":"01-JUL-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012063017461394","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012063017461394","DocDate":"30-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011110415432074","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011110415432074","DocDate":"04-NOV-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20110526023551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110526023551","DocDate":"24-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20110526023344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110526023344","DocDate":"10-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011032713342560","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011032713342560","DocDate":"27-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2010091713351590","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010091713351590","DocDate":"22-AUG-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000076092_20071219112949","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20071219112949","DocDate":"17-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000076092_20071219111941","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20071219111941","DocDate":"06-DEC-2007"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Sudan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
