It will support reform efforts and finance investments designed to: a) stimulate private sector financing and execution of research and development; b) increase and improve the stock of S&T human capital; and c) supply support services required to increase the efficiency of public and private investments in S&T activities.  The project has three components.  First, the technology development component will stimulate R&D&E (research, development, and nonroutine engineering) activities in the private sector, focusing on innovations by small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs).  Second, the S&T research component will increase and improve the stock of high-level human capital, focusing on investments on scientific research and graduate training under improved procedures and policies.  Third, the sectoral support activities will improve efficiency and quality throughout the S&T system.  This will support portfolio protection of intellectual property rights, and provision of metrology, standards, testing, and quality (MSTQ) services."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":41},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":41},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":11},"theme3":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":23},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"155,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BG,BC,FE,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Human development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,66,41,33,48","mjthemecode":"5,3,4,8,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":41},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":41},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050304102529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050304102529","DocDate":"03-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200350142","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200350142","DocURL":"17-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980203115330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980203115330","DocDate":"26-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184739","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184739","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
