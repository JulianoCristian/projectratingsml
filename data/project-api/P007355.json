The project comprises the construction of the 22.5 MW Nispero hydroelectric plant, and the 30 MW Puerto Cortes diesel plant; studies of energy sector organization and ENEE's management system and organization, a national electrification master plan, preparation of a hydropower inventory updating, a prefeasibility study of the Piedras Amarillas hydro project, and a training program for ENEE. The project faces no special risks except for the complex geology of the Nispero hydro component site and the possibility of limited international contractor interest in this component because of its small size."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902314677","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902314677","DocDate":"30-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3a9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3a9_1_0","DocDate":"14-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912401083","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912401083","DocDate":"31-OCT-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras"}},"facets":{}}
