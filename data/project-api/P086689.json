The first component aims at developing, fine-tuning and certifying the tools to implement forecasts and analyses, analytical work on qualitative and quantitative information regarding urban passenger, and freight movements, and on the impact of the new transport system on transport demand, focusing also on low-income households. As well, legislative changes will be prepared, and, sound strategies for road space recovery will be designed and tested, including the overall marketing of the Transantiago system. The second component will focus on the public transport, supported by a user perception survey of the new public transport system to collect information specifically on service quality, in particular, for low-income households. Through the third components, the project will support the environmental dimension of the urban transport reform, by providing regular data on air pollution, and noise created by the transport system, through technical assistance and supply of specific equipment. The fourth component consists of three main activities: 1) an impact analysis of Transantiago-PTUS on urban development; 2) an analysis of the transport and urban planning entities, and design of instruments to facilitate inter-institutional coordination; and, 3) technological and legal support for the development of the \"one-stop process\" project. The fifth component supports the social aspects of the Transantiago-PTUS systemic transport workers and public transport users, to include design and implementation of a strategy that raises awareness
