There are three project components. 1) The crisis relief program will provide scholarships to the poor and special assistance funds to schools serving poor communities. 2) Institutional reform will enable districts, subdistricts, and schools to plan education activities within their district, manage the education program between the different agencies, use appropriate techniques for planning and implementation, assign staff according to needs, and carry out targeted activities. It will support project management, implementation of the integrated plans, and establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system. 3) Quality improvements will finance primary school rehabilitation and maintenance, teacher-training programs, procurement and distribution of learning materials and equipment, teacher deployment in rural areas, rehabilitation and provision of equipment of private school, and upgrading of religious school teachers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":38},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":38},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"63,830,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BH,ET,BC,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,61,57,78,65","mjthemecode":"8,10,7,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":38},{"Name":"Education","Percent":38},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070515100835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070515100835","DocDate":"04-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030416211671","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030416211671","DocDate":"16-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052516553972","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052516553972","DocDate":"16-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052609580273","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052609580273","DocDate":"16-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052609592137","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052609592137","DocDate":"16-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99033006070641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99033006070641","DocDate":"17-MAR-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
