There are four components. The first component, financial sector regulation, has banking and non-banking subcomponents: It provides technical assistance to help draft laws and regulations establishing a deposit guarantee fund, and improving transparency and governance of financial institutions. It helps attract foreign capital by managing risk; creates a coordinating body to issue norms governing the sector; and improves the insurance industry and regulatory oversight. It also improves capital markets, improving pension fund operation, and builds the capacity of regulatory authorities. The second component helps draft or amend competition law, SIRESE (cross-sectoral) law, and administrative procedures law. This component pays for legal and technical experts to draft transport law and concessions regulations, to improve the regulatory framework for the hydrocarbon industry, and to develop regulations concerning communications system services. It also builds capacity to open long distance and local service sectors to competition. The third component funds public enterprise divestiture and reforms the public services cooperative. The fourth component funds a public information campaign."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":32},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"BG,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Rule of law"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"33,34,40,43","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,4,3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":68},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":32}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20051201171010","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051201171010","DocDate":"22-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031210004582","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031210004582","DocDate":"20-JUL-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980709144548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980709144548","DocDate":"05-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101532","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101532","DocDate":"14-MAY-1998"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
