The DPG will be a stand-alone operation in response to an increased level of uncertainty in Afghanistan that could impact the Government's commitment to a multi-year reform program. Presidential elections are planned for August 2009, to be followed by parliamentary elections in 2010. The DPG will follow broadly the core development objectives of the Programmatic Support for Institution Building (PSIB) series: (i) improve fiscal policy and planning, and public financial management, and (ii) strengthen public administration reform, including sub-national administration. The DPG will continue supporting these two objectives, while adding a third one: (iii) increase transparency and accountability in the management of public finances. This objective contributes to the Government's efforts to address weak governance and corruption. The purpose of the DPG is to secure sound macroeconomic management and fiduciary standards for all resources channeled through the Afghan core budget including funds from the World Bank and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). The DPG is aiming at providing synergies to other parts of the Afghanistan portfolio, including investment projects, analytical work, and the ARTF administration."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":24},"sector3":{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":21},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"AF","sectorcode":"BH,LS,BZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Economic management"],"themecode":"23,27,25,29","mjthemecode":"2,2,2,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","code":"LS"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":24},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":13},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20130711151428","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130711151428","DocDate":"25-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20110810232555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20110810232555","DocDate":"18-JUL-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2010060410124957","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010060410124957","DocDate":"07-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20090514031933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090514031933","DocDate":"01-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090421112210","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090421112210","DocDate":"09-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000020953_20090114150818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20090114150818","DocDate":"31-DEC-2008"}],"countryname":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan"}},"facets":{}}
