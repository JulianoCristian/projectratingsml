Specifically, the project will assist in financing: metered tubewells and water mains, storage tanks, service connections with meters, leak detection equipment, and secondary sewers. Consultancy fees are provided for supervision of project works as well as feasibility studies for a follow-up project. The project includes a training component, directed mainly towards operational staff. The project will benefit well over a quarter million urban poor through provision of additional connections, public standpipes and sewers. Direct benefits of wholesome water supplies and shorter waiting times at public hydrants will be supplemented by indirect environmental and public health benefits."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"22,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924171733","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924171733","DocDate":"03-OCT-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b0822b8b56_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0822b8b56_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b0822b8b55_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0822b8b55_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902332990","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902332990","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
