The project will assist in financing: (a) 146 miles of new and 20 miles of improved embankment; (b) construction and improvement of 145 miles of main and village roads; (c) drainage improvements including sluices and gravity drainage regulators and the construction of a secondary drainage system for about 21,800 acres; (d) construction of channels for gravity irrigation for 30,000 acres; (e) a fisheries development study and infrastructure investments; and (f) groundwater investigation works. The principal benefit of the project will be incremental foodgrain production of about 40,000 tons of milled rice and 10,000 tons of wheat. The project will benefit about 113,200 farm families and will facilitate substantial reductions in the level of absolute poverty."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"27,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902382082","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902382082","DocDate":"31-OCT-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05ab9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05ab9_1_0","DocDate":"27-OCT-1981"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
