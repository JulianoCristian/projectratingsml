The Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (SDPRP's) goals, objectives and strategies were set in the context of a decade of progress in economic performance and poverty reduction. Following the collapse of the Derg regime, structural reforms began in the early 1990s. Foreign exchange markets were liberalized and the birr was devalued, bringing a 50% depreciation in the real exchange rate. Initial emphasis was placed on the agriculture sector, where reforms reversed the heavy burden of implicit taxes on the rural economy. Restrictions on grain traders were relaxed and then lifted, food delivery quotas on farmers were lifted, whilst restrictions on agricultural input markets were lowered and seed and fertilizer availability increased dramatically. Farmgate prices for tradeables improved, productivity increased, and production expanded. Progress was also made in improving the efficiency of tax policy and in lowering customs tariffs. Privatization reforms began, and a homegrown civil service reform program - comprising expenditure and human resource managements reforms as well as initiatives in performance improvement and ethics - was launched to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Ethiopia's nascent federal system. Growth in the reform period since 1992/3 averaged 5.8% per annum, implying historically high per capita GDP growth of about 2.8% per year. Growth in the early days of the reform period came from an increase in private consumption, was spread quite evenly across the agricultural, industrial and service sectors and was spur"},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Program Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Program Information Document","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"JA,FA,YZ,AZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"75,43,26,44,27","mjthemecode":"2,4,2,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20080623033316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080623033316","DocDate":"21-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070918101215","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070918101215","DocDate":"21-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201374839","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201374839","DocDate":"05-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000090341_20040123134858","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040123134858","DocDate":"20-JAN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000012009_20031212154343","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20031212154343","DocDate":"11-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20031212090907","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20031212090907","DocDate":"11-DEC-2003"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
