Institution building measures included in the project would help to establish the administrative, policy making, planning and technological capacity required to implement a balanced energy program. The project also includes pilot and demonstration schemes involving renewable energy applications and introduction of energy conservation measures. The Ministry of Commerce components include: (i) energy planning, including the collection and analysis of existing energy data, medium- and long-term energy plans, and recommendations on energy pricing; (ii) assistance in strengthening energy audit capabilities; and (iii) a renewable energy component, creation of a solar and wind resource measurement network, and pilot and demonstration projects and studies involving solar, wind, and biogas renewable energy applications. Assistance to the Electricity Authority of Cyprus would entail the introduction of energy conservation measures and installation of appropriate energy conserving equipment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cyprus!$!CY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CY","sectorcode":"PY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","code":"PY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925172744","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925172744","DocDate":"27-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99964_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99964_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902420026","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902420026","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901020626","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901020626","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cyprus"}},"facets":{}}
