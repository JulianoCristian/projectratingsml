The project will thus contribute to a sustainable infrastructure, fostering community-led development. The project components include: 1) institutional strengthening for poverty reduction, to further increase the role and responsibilities of communities in the subproject cycle development, including subproject management, and strengthening promotion mechanisms. This component will include the establishment of appropriate methodologies and criteria of the subproject cycle, in accordance with all relevant parties involved in poverty reduction; 2) subproject financing, which will mobilize external co-financing, with possible support from other agencies, such as the Caribbean Development Bank and the European Union. Subproject implementation will include social and economic infrastructure, technical assistance and capacity-building for social assistance programs; 3) project management costs, to cover the execution of the design phase, and implementation, as well as monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"St. Lucia!$!LC","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"3,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"LC","sectorcode":"JA,WZ,TA,BZ,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"78,57,53,56,51","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,6,6,7,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050103132729","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050103132729","DocDate":"23-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99090205405027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99090205405027","DocDate":"19-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99072307564842","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99072307564842","DocDate":"15-JUL-1999"}],"countryname":"St. Lucia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
