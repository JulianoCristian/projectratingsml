It would include drilling 1,600 deep wells for production and 35 wells for exploration, installing pumps and electric motors, irrigation pipes, distribution canals, and sprinkler units, and constructing farm roads and surface drainage ditches. Exploratory wells would be drilled in preparation of a further expansion of the area to be irrigated under the government's groundwater development program, partly in Thessaly and partly in Macedonia and Thrace. Project wells would be about 120 meters deep and serve between 15 and 29 hectares. Pumps would be driven by electric motors. Construction of pump houses and installation of pumps including the motors would be the responsibility of the pump supplier. Sprinkler distribution systems would be used on about 80 percent of the wells. The rest would serve gravity systems. About 1,500 kilometers of farm roads and an equal length of drains would be built."},"country_namecode":"Hellenic Republic!$!GR","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GR","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904162906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904162906","DocDate":"24-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a68f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a68f_1_0","DocDate":"10-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903184881","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903184881","DocDate":"31-MAY-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903203357","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903203357","DocDate":"31-MAY-1971"}],"countryname":"Hellenic Republic"}},"facets":{}}
