It would address the most urgent sector needs. It would ensure the flow of foreign exchange needed to prevent further deterioration of telecommunications services, rehabilitate telecommunications capacity back to about pre-war levels, allow the utilization of some idle capacity existing in the system, and attain acceptable standards of postal service. It would also place the initial building blocks of institutional development - sector legislation, accounting and financial control, and comprehensive training. The Project has three main components, namely rehabilitation of telecommunications, postal and common services, technical assistance, and two years' worth of imported spare parts and materials."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"22,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"CC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","code":"CC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925171747","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925171747","DocDate":"22-NOV-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05d2d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05d2d_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902415925","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902415925","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901022955","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901022955","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
