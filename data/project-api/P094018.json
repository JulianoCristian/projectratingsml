The restructuring of the project is needed for the reasons: 1) to drop activities that are unlikely to be completed before the end of 2013 (extension of the closing date); 2) to reallocate loan proceeds to ensure completion of the civil works contract; 3) to revise selected target indicators; 4) to cancel a small amount of the loan; and 5) to extend the project closing date to ensure that all remaining activities will be finalized. However, the development objectives will not change and hence this will be processed as a level two restructuring. The restructuring is aimed at ensuring sufficient time and resources for completion of all project activities, as well as streamlining the project performance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
