It would focus on low-cost, on-plot sanitation and the development of the services, institutions, and management practices required for improved sewerage and sanitation. The project would finance construction of pit latrines and replacement or conversion of existing on-plot sanitation units; improvement of the Dar es Salaam City Council (DCC) pit emptying service; establishment and development of a Sewerage and Sanitation Department (DSSD) in DCC; provision of offices, workshops, equipment and spare parts; and technical assistance and training both for DSSD and the National Urban Water Authority.
