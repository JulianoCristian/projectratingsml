of the Rural Poverty Reduction Project in Pernambuco, Brazil to (1) improve well-being and incomes of the rural poor through greater access to basic social and economic infrastructure and services and support for productive activities, using proven community-driven development techniques; (2) increase the social capital of rural communities and capacity to organize collectively to meet their own needs; (3) enhance local governance by greater citizen participation and transparency in decision-making, through creation and strengthening of community associations and municipal councils; and (4) foster closer integration of development policies, programs and projects in rural areas at the local level by assisting the project's participatory municipal councils to extend their role in seeking funding from, setting priorities for and making decision concerning, the allocation of resources from other programs beyond the Bank-supported project."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of
