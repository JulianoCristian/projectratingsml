There are four main project components. The Community Investment Fund component consists of community-based small projects including social mobilization, infrastructure, improved natural resources management, service delivery activities, and capacity building for communities. The second component establishes a Direct Investment Fund, comprising larger projects benefiting more than one community to be managed and executed by district authorities; and builds capacity and training for local governments and administrations. The third component, Poverty Monitoring and Analysis, funds data collection and training and capacity building on financial, technical, and institutional issues; and sponsors workshops and information dissemination. The fourth component finances institutional support for ZAMSIF, supplying administration and operating costs, assessments, poverty maps, training, and capacity building."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":27},"sector2":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":18},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":18},"sector5":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":18},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"64,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"WZ,JA,TA,EZ,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"53,78,57,88,51","mjthemecode":"6,8,7,10,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":27},{"Name":"Education","Percent":19},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":18},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":18},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":18}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080703024541","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080703024541","DocDate":"26-MAR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00081205344317","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081205344317","DocDate":"06-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201125184","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201125184","DocURL":"14-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00051005301980","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051005301980","DocDate":"01-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99102905355448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99102905355448","DocDate":"17-MAR-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia"}},"facets":{}}
