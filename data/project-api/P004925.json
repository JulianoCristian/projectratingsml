The objectives are to : a) accelerate successful industrial restructuring efforts by providing technical and financial resources to 4 enterprises; b) demonstrate the process of restructuring and its costs and benefits to the industrial sector as a whole; c) begin developing the necessary information base and expertise to replicate this type of restructuring; and d) permit the authorities to monitor the effects of the evolving macroeconomic reforms (e.g. price and exchange rate changes). The project consists of 3 components : 1) investments identified in the restructuring programs for the selected enterprises, including setting-up of modern management systems, rehabilitation and
