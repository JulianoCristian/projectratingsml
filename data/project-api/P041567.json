For the year 2002, the following benchmarks are established: (1) reduce by 25 percent infant mortality attributable to malaria; (2) reduce by 90 percent school-age children morbidity attributable to urinary schistosomiasis; and (3) eliminate the risk of blindness due to onchocerciasis. To achieve these objectives, the project will support policy measures designed to: (1) improve management and implementation of disease control activities; (2) develop an integrated and computerized health management information system (SIG) and its use; and (3) strengthen the National Endemic Disease Service's (SNGE) capabilities and the Hygiene and Public Health Directorate's (DHSP) ability in project management. Specifically, project support will take the form of financing consultant services to design and produce information campaigns and national control programs, and studies and operational research; the education of opinionmakers and householders; using preventative measures and dispensing pharmaceuticals to treat schoolchildren; training nurses and the national endemic disease service staff; the procurement of computer hardware and software, furniture and other equipment; and the design and supervision of civil works."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":93},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"14,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"64,67","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":93},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050103110243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050103110243","DocDate":"14-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123440693","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123440693","DocURL":"29-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123440693","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123440693","DocDate":"29-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123440794","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123440794","DocDate":"29-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170909","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170909","DocDate":"11-APR-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
