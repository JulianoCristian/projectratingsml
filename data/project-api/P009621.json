This project includes the purchase of four new dredgers to supplement the existing, the inadequate Commissioners for the Port of Calcutta(CPC) dredging fleet, as well as other vessels to be employed on river conservancy and operational duties. In King George's Dock, the western arm will be extended to provide holding space for four ships, and four dolphin berths for ships undergoing repairs. In Kidderpore Docks a water re-circulation scheme will eliminate the siltation problem in the docks, and the no. 2 swing bridge will be replaced. Additional cranes, fork lift trucks, tractors and trailers are to be provided as a modest addition to the mechanical-handling equipment of the port. This project will provide the means of maintaining a facility vital to the continued growth of the largest and most important economic region in India."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"21,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e65fa6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e65fa6_1_0","DocDate":"17-AUG-1961"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e65fa5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e65fa5_1_0","DocDate":"17-AUG-1961"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902331049","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902331049","DocDate":"30-JUN-1961"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903463571","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903463571","DocDate":"30-JUN-1961"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
