This program has been supported by an ongoing project launched in 1983.  About 70 pumping stations would be rehabilitated by the end of 1990.  This project is a continuation of these efforts.  The main objectives of the project are : a) to avoid future declines in yields and agricultural production; b) to reduce the operation and maintenance  cost of the pumping stations; and c) to strengthen the institutional capability of MED.  Project components include : 1) rehabilitation of pumping stations; 2) supply of workshops, electrical laboratories and miscellaneous equipment; 3) civil works ( e.g.  construction of new pumping stations, workshops, stores, offices etc ); 4) institutional support; and 5) technical assistance and training."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"31,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,78","mjthemecode":"10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20040316100252","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040316100252","DocDate":"26-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99031910565245","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910565245","DocDate":"08-FEB-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032215521332","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032215521332","DocDate":"13-FEB-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928131406","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928131406","DocDate":"25-APR-1990"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
