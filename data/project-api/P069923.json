The project components will: 1) institutionalize, and strengthen the Office of Disaster Preparedness, i.e., elaborate and revise emergency procedures, by procuring specialized equipment, emergency supplies, and developing a comprehensive disaster management training, and a public awareness program. The component will also develop emergency communications, and improve meteorological assessment capacity country-wide, through technical assistance (TA), and training provision. Shelter programs, retrofitting of public buildings, and, capacity building within the Ministry of Communications and Works, and the Environmental Unit of the Ministry of Health and Environment, will be enhanced through TA, training, and provision of specific equipment; 2) support a preventive physical mitigation program, that includes river flooding, and coastal erosion protection. A comprehensive drainage improvement, flood control, and watershed management study will provide an optimal design on storm drainage systems, while a retrofit program will prioritize on health facilities; and, 3) provide project management, including funding for specialists in financial management, accounting, and procurement, in addition to a disaster management specialist. Moreover, project management training will be provided to participating Government staff."},"country_namecode":"St. Vincent and the Grenadines!$!VC","sector1":{"Name":"Central government
