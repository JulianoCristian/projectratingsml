The first component funds health services delivery. The first of its two sub-components finance primary health care by developing group practice pilots for medical group practices and providing medical equipment, training, and technical assistance in financial management. The second sub-component strengthens hospitals and secondary services by providing 1) technical assistance to develop a strategy for restructuring and rationalization of an acute care unit; 2) developing demonstration programs for alternative levels of medical care including day surgery, hospice, respite, and home and ambulatory care; and 3) provides resuscitation/monitoring equipment for county emergency rooms and equipment for cardiac diagnostic centers. The second component provides public health monitoring and program evaluation; and supports national health promotion. The third component funds disposal of pharmaceutical waste. The fourth component strengthens systems in ways that support the first three components, and that also provide essential building blocks for regulatory, governance, and management initiatives. Initiatives include a management information system; and developing clinical protocols, facilities standards and guidelines for care, as well as a department to coordinate these activities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Croatia!$!HR","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"29,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"HR","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"89,58,67","mjthemecode":"8,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":94},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060721094939","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060721094939","DocDate":"28-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99082405303060","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99082405303060","DocDate":"02-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911054011","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911054011","DocDate":"20-OCT-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Croatia"}},"facets":{}}
