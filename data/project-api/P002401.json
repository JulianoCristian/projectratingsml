It also provides assistance for the government's efforts to strengthen educational planning, administration, management, evaluation, and project implementation. Over a six-year period, the project will construct and equip classrooms for about 22,500 primary school students, staff housing, a new teacher training college in Freetown, and facilities for a textbook distribution service. It will also provide over one million textbooks and teachers' guides. All primary school children will benefit from the quality improvements supported by the project. The project will provide increased opportunities to attend school in the Northern area, which is the least developed part of the country and where only 20 percent of school-age children currently attend school."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Sierra Leone!$!SL","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":75},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SL","sectorcode":"ET,EP,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,65","mjthemecode":"8,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14},{"Name":"Education","Percent":75},{"Name":"Education","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019224154","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019224154","DocDate":"19-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e058fe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e058fe_1_0","DocDate":"03-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902410819","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902410819","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912584933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912584933","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Sierra Leone"}},"facets":{}}
