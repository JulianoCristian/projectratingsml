Additional objectives are to train local engineers and contractors, improve road maintenance, and support improved planning and preparation of rural transport projects. The project consists of: (a) improvement of paving of the Highlands Highway section between Kassam Pass and Daulo Pass (137 km), including supervision of the work by consultants, technical assistance to DWS in contract management and training of PNG engineers on the works; (b) improvement of road maintenance, including technical assistance and training of DWS and provincial governments staff by consultants; (c) improvement of rural transport, including technical assistance and engineering of priority road projects; (d) engineering of the Togoba - Wapenamanda road; and (e) procurement of traffic counting equipment. The main risk would be a failure to achieve the wide distribution of project benefits; the proposed project includes measures to minimize this risk."},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine!$!PG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PG","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20081127034529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20081127034529","DocDate":"30-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924233106","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924233106","DocDate":"07-OCT-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190234247","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190234247","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e961c4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961c4_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e041dd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e041dd_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191248527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191248527","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine"}},"facets":{}}
