A key project objective is to reduce dependence on public expenditure to finance developments in the sector by using available resources more efficiently and by significantly improving cost recovery and cost containment practices. To assist in the policy reforms and management improvement efforts, the project will provide technical assistance and training, equipment, materials, vehicles and incremental staff. To strengthen health and family planning service delivery, it will finance renovation and equipping of a limited number of service facilities and provision of essential drugs and medical supplies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Sierra Leone!$!SL","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"5,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"SL","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance","Human development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,67,27,69","mjthemecode":"8,2,8,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019225715","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019225715","DocDate":"29-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e369a8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e369a8_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAY-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092535","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092535","DocDate":"30-APR-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Sierra Leone"}},"facets":{}}
