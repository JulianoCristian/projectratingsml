The project will have three components: 1) the civil works component will improve the country's access to the ports of Bulgaria and Albania through the rehabilitation and upgrading of about 60 km of the East-West Corridor; 2) the transit facilitation component will fund technical assistance and equipment for the development and implementation of a modern customs system and the improvement of transit times; and 3) the institutional strengthening component will fund technical assistance and training to strengthen MTC, MUDCEE and RO in the area of economic evaluation of different road interventions and life-cost planning for pavement management."},"country_namecode":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of!$!MK","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":93},"sector2":{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"24,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MK","sectorcode":"YY,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,54","mjthemecode":"6,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Other domestic and international trade","code":"YY"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":93},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200184979","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200184979","DocURL":"08-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200184878","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200184878","DocURL":"08-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200184979","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200184979","DocDate":"08-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200184878","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200184878","DocDate":"08-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007225601","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007225601","DocDate":"21-MAR-1995"}],"countryname":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of"}},"facets":{}}
