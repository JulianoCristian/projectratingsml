The restructuring will consist of a partial cancellation of the credit and a reallocation between credit categories, as requested by the Government of Senegal (GoS). The cancellation of the project subcomponent does not change the Project Development Objectives (PDO). A first extension of the credit closing date was granted from January 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. To date the amount of US$ 4,646,908.21 has been disbursed. To date rehabilitation/reinforcement works in generation and transmission have not started due to delays in: 1) the selection of investments by SENELEC (Societe Nationale d'Electricite - National Power Utility of Senegal) in view of insufficient funding and; 2) the preparation of bidding documents once the choice was made."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
