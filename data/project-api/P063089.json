This is the first part of International Development Association's three-part strategy to help Bangladesh respond to the 1998 floods. The project will provide assistance for: 1) the agricultural sector, to ensure that farmers have adequate supplies of seeds, fertilizers, and other agricultural inputs for planing the next boro rice crops; 2) additional food grain imports in order to maintain and augment food grain stocks that will otherwise be depleted with the partial loss of two rice crops; 3) the manufacturing sector, in order to enable manufacturers to import machinery, spare parts, and other raw materials; and 4) additional imports of fuel, cement, and other construction materials that are needed for relief operations and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"BC,AH,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"52,23","mjthemecode":"1,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":35},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":35},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201020431","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201020431","DocURL":"30-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201020431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201020431","DocDate":"30-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_99031911080814","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911080814","DocDate":"30-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703525127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703525127","DocDate":"08-OCT-1998"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
