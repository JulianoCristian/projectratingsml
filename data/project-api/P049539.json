These responsibilities encompass providing sectoral vision and leadership, analysis and policy follow-up of the health needs of the poor and risks to the public at-large, advocacy of best practices and standards, and support for local initiative. This project has two components. One addresses health needs and issues in specific districts and provinces such as managing decentralization, resource mobilization, and district funding allocations. The second component focuses on strenthening the capacity of MOHSW to control communicable diseases, assuring equity in service provision, and assessing health research needs, capacities, and options, as well as on creating an autonomous food and drug control agency."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":4},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"sector4":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":11},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"103,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BK,BC,BH,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Rural development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"67,78,26,57,93","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,7,2,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20131121150028","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20131121150028","DocDate":"13-NOV-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20080805050142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080805050142","DocDate":"27-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.01/01/2005","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20051005100150","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20051005100150","DocDate":"23-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2010030416170572","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010030416170572","DocURL":"30-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201233219","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201233219","DocURL":"30-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060904004427","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060904004427","DocDate":"25-MAY-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
