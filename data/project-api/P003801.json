Approximately 70,000 subloans will be extended to indigenous SSEs in virtually all economic sectors, creating some 140,000 new jobs at an investment cost per job of about $4,000. The training and actual lending experience gained by handling banks' staff under the proposed project will improve their operational skills in term lending and sharpen their awareness of the financial and technical problems of small borrowers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"106,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912535120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912535120","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902374813","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902374813","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
