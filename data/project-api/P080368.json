Moreover, the project will help restore the productive capability of the populations, and support longer term disaster management by the Government. Activities financed by the project will complement relief efforts, contribute to recovery, facilitate continued progress on key economic priorities and investments, and address the needs of vulnerable groups during this difficult period of crisis. The components include: 1) a quick disbursing assistance to support critical imports, 2) support for expansion of public works programs, and essential social investments, and services to vulnerable groups; and, 3) support for implementation, technical assistance, and studies to facilitate economic recovery. Risks however point at potential delays in the delivery of pledged humanitarian assistance by other donors, and, given the magnitude of the effort and logistical challenges, relief may not be fully successful. To mitigate this, donors have sent a joint task force to coordinate, monitor, and report on pledges, shipments and disbursements. Risk of mismanagement of project funds will be minimized by establishing effective mechanisms to ensure transparent utilization of resources, through strict auditing, and reporting requirements."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Technical Annex","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"BC,JB,JA,EZ,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"themecode":"68,52,78,56,51","mjthemecode":"6,6,10,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":50},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000310607_20071010095518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20071010095518","DocDate":"24-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050630084633","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050630084633","DocDate":"20-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022515452223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022515452223","DocDate":"19-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051312342024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051312342024","DocDate":"19-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0210290402077","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0210290402077","DocDate":"23-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0209260416119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0209260416119","DocDate":"21-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_02100804010737","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02100804010737","DocDate":"30-SEP-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
