The project would eliminate seasonal flooding and would reclaim 6,000 ha which are permanently flooded. The latter, together with 7,800 ha of land held in excess of 50 ha per existing farm to be expropriated under existing land reform laws, would be used to settle about 1,000 landless farmers on empresas comunitarias; in addition, another 2,800 small farms of less than 12 ha would benefit from the land improvement program. The project would also provide extension services and improvement of social infrastructure for education, health, village water supply, rural electrification and telephone service. INCORA would manage an agricultural credit fund, utilizing the Caja Agraria as banking agent, to provide medium- and long-term credit to small farmers. Subloans would be for on-farm development, purchase of farm machinery, construction of infrastructure on livestock farms and purchase of breeding stock."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"21,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925090812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925090812","DocDate":"21-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902244054","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902244054","DocDate":"30-JUN-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901164297","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901164297","DocDate":"30-JUN-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e723f6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e723f6_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUN-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e723f4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e723f4_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUN-1975"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
