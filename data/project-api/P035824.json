There are six project components. The first, support for technology development, enhances capacity for research coordination; establishes a competitive agricultural research program (CARP) to support time bound adaptive research on priority constraints, increases productivity of the smallholder agriculture; and strengthens research support for technology dissemination activities. The second establishes a demand-driven technology dissemination system through rationalizing, reorienting, and strengthening line departments; increases participation by the private sector in input supply and support services; increases participation by the farming communities mobilized with the help of nongovernmental organizations; and supports human resource development and greater use of information technology. The third supports increased private sector involvement and public/private partnerships in agri-business development. The fourth supports rural infrastructure development by improving rural roads in the project districts, rural markets, and market information collection and dissemination systems. The fifth supports a project management and enhanced capacity for economic policy analysis while the sixth supports a project preparation facility."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
