To achieve these objectives, the project will, first, increase production and improve workers' social conditions in two cocoa plantations (Bela Vista and Uba Budo), and, second, reinforce Sao Tome and Principe's (STP) agriculture sector.  The project will accomplish this latter item by facilitating future financing of other plantations in the cocoa subsector; creating applied research capacities in the food crop subsector; (iii) supporting smallholders development; and (iv) addressing other issues through studies and consulting services.  This latter element will assist the Government in formulating and implementing its policies, in diversifying  its agricultural base, and in shifting the status of its state enterprises to that of mixed-economy enterprises."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Prin!$!ST","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"7,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ST","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120295784","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120295784","DocURL":"02-SEP-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120295784","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120295784","DocDate":"02-SEP-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36c64_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36c64_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926013024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926013024","DocDate":"29-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Prin"}},"facets":{}}
