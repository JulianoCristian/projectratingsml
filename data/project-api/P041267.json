As the project involves two separate implementing agencies - the Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning (MOC) and the Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA) - it is divided into two parts, one for each agency, each to be implemented independently of the other. MOC will implement the following: 1) Hodeidah-Salif, 65 km road rehabilitation; 2) Am Ayn-Naqabah, 100 km road rehabilitation; 3) equipment, software and training for maintenance planning; 4) assistance to the newly created Yemen Road Fund Board; 5) study for planning and prioritizing road maintenance needs and detailed design for rehabilitation of key highway links; and 6) implementation and construction supervision consultants. CAMA will implement: 1) Aden International Airport (AIA) terminal reconstruction; 2) new control tower and technical building at AIA; 3) communications/navaids equipment; 4) safety equipment; 5) civil aviation strategy and policy study; and 6) implementation, design and construction supervision."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":52},"sector2":{"Name":"Aviation","Percent":43},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"37,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Aviation"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"BC,TV,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development"],"themecode":"74","mjthemecode":"9,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Aviation","code":"TV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":52},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":43},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000112742_20041108114914","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20041108114914","DocDate":"27-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0212280400341","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0212280400341","DocDate":"11-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123385585","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123385585","DocURL":"06-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123385384","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123385384","DocDate":"06-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123385083","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123385083","DocDate":"06-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123385083","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123385083","DocURL":"06-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123385384","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123385384","DocURL":"06-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123385585","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123385585","DocDate":"06-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23c38_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23c38_1_0","DocDate":"20-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961008053525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008053525","DocDate":"22-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008031002","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008031002","DocDate":"22-DEC-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
