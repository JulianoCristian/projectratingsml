The program's objectives are to (a) improve the financial and organizational management of municipalities; (b) improve the programming of priority urban investments; (c) rationalize and simplify the financing of urban investments; and (d) upgrade basic infrastructure in urban and some rural communities. The first principal component consists of building the capacity of central and local governments through (1) implementing a Municipal Adjustment Program (MAP) and (2) supporting activities aimed at providing an enabling environment for these MAPs to take place (such as training, fiscal reforms study, etc.). The second principal component consists of physical investments like building, rehabilitating, and maintaining public infrastructure, facilities, and services under the responsibility of local governments (roads, drainage, and lighting; education and health facilities; socio-collective facilities; administrative and technical buildings; revenue-generating facilities; environmental sub-projects; and rehabilitation of historic buildings)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":36},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":16},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":16},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":16},"sector5":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"75,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"TZ,WZ,JA,JB,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Urban development","Urban development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,74,72,26,84","mjthemecode":"11,2,9,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":36},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":16},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":16},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":16},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000011823_20050805110229","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000011823_20050805110229","DocDate":"28-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030915405396","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030915405396","DocDate":"29-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050516341198","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050516341198","DocDate":"29-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042809124897","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042809124897","DocDate":"29-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_9810190331274","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190331274","DocDate":"04-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171144","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171144","DocDate":"22-OCT-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
