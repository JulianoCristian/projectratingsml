It supports a reform minded Government as it starts to implement measures to address a deep fiscal crisis brought on by the global recession and pre-election spending and policy drift. It does so during a period of continued political uncertainty in which the new Parliament has twice failed to elect a President, meaning that another round of general elections is likely in the second half of 2010. The operation is therefore designed as a bridge to a longer term program of annual support which could be developed once political uncertainty abates. The operation will support short-term corrective policies in the new Government's 'Economic Stabilization and Recovery Program' in two ways. First, the program helps to protect priority expenditures for economic recovery and social protection during fiscal correction. The operation supports enhanced finding for targeted social assistance and road maintenance and a redirection of agriculture subsidies towards more efficient investment grants. The latter two actions should enhance economic activity. Whilst reducing vehicle operating costs in the economy and preserving public investments, the increase in road maintenance will also help employ returning migrants and recently unemployed construction workers. Second the operation will lay the foundations for a sustained post-crisis recovery through exports and private investment. It will assist Government to remove longstanding structural policy constraints and cumbersome regulations which retard improvements in Moldova's productivity and competitiveness, restrain exports, limit foreign direct investment, and which have led to jobless growth in recent years. The removal of these constraints should dampen the recession and place Moldova on firmer foundations for growth and job "},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Information technology","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":30},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":10},"theme5":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":15},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"},{"Name":"Information technology"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MD","sectorcode":"TI,FZ,JB,CA,LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"47,39,81,54,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,6,11,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"},{"name":"Information technology","code":"CA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways","code":"TI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":30},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20130917153836","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20130917153836","DocDate":"27-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010100709581788","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010100709581788","DocDate":"12-AUG-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333038_20101019233323","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20101019233323","DocDate":"14-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000020953_20100428125148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20100428125148","DocDate":"04-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20091209154839","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20091209154839","DocDate":"04-DEC-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Moldova","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
