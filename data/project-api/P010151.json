The project will: (i) improve the provision of inputs and services required for the directly productive sectors; (ii) increase plantings of coconut and minor export crops; (iii) rehabilitate and improve economic infrastructure; and (iv) improve social infrastructure. The project will benefit about 130,000 farm families, about two-thirds of these families being in the poverty target groups. The project design closely follows the model developed for the Kurunegala Rural Development Project (Credit No. 891). The project suffers from inherent risks associated with such a multi-component project and faces difficulties associated with actions in politically sensitive and institutionally demanding areas. However, such risks are reduced by the successful experience with decentralized system in the above-mentioned Kurunegala project."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"33,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102956","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102956","DocDate":"28-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04512_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04512_1_0","DocDate":"09-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902362832","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902362832","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912494916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912494916","DocDate":"31-OCT-1980"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
