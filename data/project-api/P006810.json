Therefore, the Second National Highway Sector Project consists of an investment component to be financed under the loan, and of a policy reform and institutional development Action Plan.  The investment component consists of a time-slice of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport's (MOPT) 1987-1993 highway program including (i) civil works for rehabilitation of paved and gravel roads, for paving of gravel roads, and for periodic maintenance of paved roads; (ii) supervision of the corresponding road rehabilitation and paving works; and (iii) road safety.  It further entails (iv) road maintenance equipment and spares and a communications system; (v) training programs; and (vi) technical assistance.  Under the Action Plan the project aims to (i) strengthen MOPT's highway management capabilities; (ii) adjust sector policies, and (iii) improve the transport budgetary process at the level of MOPT."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"180,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019123728","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019123728","DocDate":"30-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041914491675","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041914491675","DocDate":"08-OCT-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032214215376","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032214215376","DocDate":"08-OCT-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
