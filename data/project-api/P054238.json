To achieve the goals of restoring social and economic wellbeing to the people of the Gazelle Peninsula, the overall program and Bank-financed project will support the following six components. The first component, quality of life improvement in displaced communities, will include: land mobilization; infrastructure and utility services; social and public safety services; community development; and economic support. Transportation infrastructure, utility infrastructure, social services, public safety, economic support, and government administration reform comprise the second component, Kokopo's consolidation as the provincial capital. The third component, Rabaul's restoration as a regional port, will deal with land management; port-related infrastructure and facilities rehabilitation; and restoration of essential utilities, infrastructure, and public services. Utility infrastructure and social services for the North Eastern Gazelle Peninsula are the fourth component while the fifth is institution building for longer term development planning. The final component will contain design and supervision of project components for the first phase of the project and design of components planned for implementation during the second phase."},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine!$!PG","sector1":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":29},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Power","Percent":17},"sector5":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"25,260,000","sector":[{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Resettlement Plan","countrycode":"PG","sectorcode":"BZ,LD,JB,WZ,TZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"62,39,71,52","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,9,4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":29},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":21},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":17},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20091028014424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20091028014424","DocDate":"19-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20051013110623","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051013110623","DocDate":"12-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201444036","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201444036","DocURL":"19-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201444137","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201444137","DocURL":"19-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99112505311322","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99112505311322","DocDate":"01-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173859","DocDate":"12-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_99111305454354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99111305454354","DocDate":"01-JAN-1999"}],"countryname":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
