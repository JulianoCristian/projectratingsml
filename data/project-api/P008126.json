Expected economic benefits from the proposed project would consist of reduced port operating and maintenance cost for ANP and ship servicing and waiting times for ocean carriers. The net effect of these improvements would be reductions in transport costs to users: primarily to consumers of imports and the producers of exports in Uruguay. The project would improve Uruguay's position in foreign trade and potentially contribute to the country's economic recovery. There are risks inherent in ANP's inexperience with the implementation of a large size port development program, which may result in delays and cost overruns; furthermore, the expected benefits may not be derived from the project if operational changes do not occur as new equipment is introduced."},"country_namecode":"Oriental Republic of Uruguay!$!UY","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UY","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e958fc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958fc_1_0","DocDate":"22-JAN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e958fb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958fb_1_0","DocDate":"22-JAN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902341381","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902341381","DocDate":"31-DEC-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912471428","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912471428","DocDate":"31-DEC-1979"}],"countryname":"Oriental Republic of Uruguay"}},"facets":{}}
