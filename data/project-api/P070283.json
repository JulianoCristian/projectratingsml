There are three project components. The first provides small loans for private businesses. The second component strengthens land and property administration in order to reduce uncertainty and the lack of public confidence presently characterizing the land property environment in East Timor, and to alleviate conflicting claims on land, which risks social disruption and constrains the urgently needed reestablishment of businesses and public services. This component funds the United Nations Center for Human Settlements (Habitat), which will provide and manage technical assistance to strengthen the service delivery of the UN Transitional Administration's (UNTAET) Land and Property Commission. Service delivery will be improved in the areas of land registration, cadastral survey and mapping, and land law; and policies will be reviewed relating to land rights adjudication and allocation of public and abandoned property. The third component finances technical assistance, specifically consultant services and the initial fixed costs of the commercial bank that is to intermediate, administer, and implement the loan component and handle disbursement."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!$!TP","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":40},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"4,850,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Agreement","countrycode":"TP","sectorcode":"BG,BC,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"74,41,36,83","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,3,4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":86},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20030707143918","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030707143918","DocDate":"26-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00031505342040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00031505342040","DocDate":"19-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00082605400743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082605400743","DocDate":"17-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050611011439","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050611011439","DocDate":"11-APR-2000"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
