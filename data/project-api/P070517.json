The project has one component, for labor intensive activities of debris collection and solid waste management. With a duration of five months, the project will be divided into three stages: 1) A pilot stage involving one community in the most urgent area of Dili to establish recruitment and related procedures and their effectiveness. This phase will concentrate on the cleaning up of rubble and debris before moving onto refuse removal. 2) A second stage involving cleaning of rubble and debris from within some 25 functional villages within Dili. 3) When building-rubble and debris is substantially cleared from within a community attention will focus on the collection and removal of domestic refuse. Benefits from the project will derive from: a) social stabilization established by the provision of short term employment; b) injection of funds caused by wage payments into local communities; c) public health improvements created by environmental enhancement; d) community confidence in reconstruction efforts created by visual impact of cleaning the city; and e) social reintegration within and between communities initiated by community cooperation."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!$!TP","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Solid waste management","Percent":37},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Solid waste management"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TP","sectorcode":"BH,WB,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,51,56","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Solid waste management","code":"WB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":60},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":37},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0107240402534","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0107240402534","DocDate":"27-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052615162937","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052615162937","DocDate":"01-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00082505330023","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082505330023","DocDate":"29-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00060905451867","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00060905451867","DocDate":"27-MAR-2000"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
