It seeks to assure and increase the income of rubber-growing smallholders and increase Sri Lanka's export earnings by improving the quantity and relative value of smallholder rubber. The project plans to achieve this by replanting 35,550 ha of overaged trees and planting an additional 3,200 ha of rubber on unproductive land. It also intends to enhance the efficiency of institutional support available to smallholders through the rationalization and strengthening of the Government agencies directly involved. The project further aims to minimize the negative effect of a recent disease outbreak by providing compensation for the removal of susceptible trees."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":83},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":2},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"23,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"BC,AB,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"45,79,77","mjthemecode":"10,10,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":83},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123233953","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123233953","DocURL":"13-JUL-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123234054","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123234054","DocURL":"13-JUL-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123234255","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123234255","DocURL":"13-JUL-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07f32_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07f32_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926154655","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926154655","DocDate":"02-MAY-1988"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
