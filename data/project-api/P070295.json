The three main components will: 1) provide funding for road maintenance, on those sections of the main network not requiring rehabilitation, but in need of maintenance to remain serviceable. Maintenance works will cover approximately 1,500 km of the main network, and will include treatment of potholes, surface dressing, cleaning of drainage systems, and road signaling, to restore traffic safety; 2) perform road rehabilitation activities, on approximately 150 km of the main network, and will include restoration of culverts/drainage systems, overlays. Only a selective emergency reconstruction will be performed, on those sections almost destructed, given the scarce availability of funds. Overlay works will be performed on a high priority stretch of the Pristina-Gnjilane road; and, 3) support the re-establishment of a core road management capacity in Kosovo, providing technical assistance to the Directorate of Roads, in road maintenance, capacity building, and project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kosovo!$!XK","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"XK","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,39,78,71","mjthemecode":"9,10,4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040625135529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040625135529","DocDate":"21-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051409534367","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051409534367","DocDate":"15-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051409551299","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051409551299","DocDate":"15-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00081805532189","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081805532189","DocDate":"25-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00042005515513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00042005515513","DocDate":"14-JUL-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kosovo"}},"facets":{}}
