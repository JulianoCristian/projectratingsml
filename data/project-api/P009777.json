The T&V System has already been introduced in 15 of the State's districts under an earlier IDA-supported project. The project faces no special risks, although realization of the expected benefits will depend heavily on the State Government's ability to effectively manage the reorganized extension system, maintaining a single line of command from extension headquarters to the field-level workers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"37,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902372254","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902372254","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912530750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912530750","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e042b0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e042b0_1_0","DocDate":"23-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e042ae_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e042ae_1_0","DocDate":"23-APR-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
