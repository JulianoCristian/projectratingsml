The main thrust of the project will be to increase production of 4,000 project farmers and to provide complementary infrastructure (85 km of roads; 20 irrigation wells) and social services (six health posts; potable water supply) for all of the 10,000 rural families presently living in the project area. With the use of improved seed, additional fertilizer, supplementary irrigation, and improved breeding stock, yields can be more than doubled and incomes increased accordingly. These increases can be achieved, however, only through a well coordinated package of activities involving credit for investments and working capital, technical assistance, supporting infrastructure, and some improvement of social facilities which will directly help to improve the quality of life of the farmers."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20090128013116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090128013116","DocDate":"30-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902253264","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902253264","DocDate":"29-FEB-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901464194","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901464194","DocDate":"29-FEB-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e72786_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e72786_1_0","DocDate":"17-FEB-1976"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
