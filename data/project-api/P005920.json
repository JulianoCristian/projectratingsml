This restructuring will reallocate funds in the amount of USD 290,000 from category one (sub grants; investments) to category two (goods and consultants' services under part B of the project; consultancies and project management). The reallocation of grant proceeds is needed to finance the increase in consultancy and project management costs associated with the last extension of this umbrella project's closing date from November 30, 2010 until December 30, 2014."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"0","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0003435910","geoLocName":"Buenos Aires","latitude":"-34.613152","longitude":"-58.377232"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"84","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b08247a577_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08247a577_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAY-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b082085234_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082085234_1_0","DocDate":"17-NOV-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081952dba_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081952dba_1_0","DocDate":"23-FEB-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012070916533243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012070916533243","DocDate":"09-JUL-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011122812360920","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011122812360920","DocDate":"28-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022309095094","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022309095094","DocDate":"23-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000362596_2011031610480363","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000362596_2011031610480363","DocDate":"19-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000333038_20101109224331","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20101109224331","DocDate":"08-NOV-2010"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
