The series aims to support the government's efforts to implement the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Specifically, the one-tranche development policy grant (EGRG I) in the amount of SDR 5.4 million (US$8 million equivalent) focuses on reforms that will help promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources, and foster private sector development by reducing the up-front costs and uncertainties of business creation and promoting a level playing field for private investors. These two planks are critical components of PRSP pillars one (good governance, macroeconomic stability, and public administration reform); and two (private sector-led growth). The grant is thus an integral part of International Development Association (IDA) Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Guinea-Bissau for FY09-10 planned to be presented to the board together with this operation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea-Bissau!$!GW","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":43},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":42},"theme3":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":23},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document","countrycode":"GW","sectorcode":"YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Rule of law","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"25,34,27,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,3,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":57},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":43}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012010316062932","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012010316062932","DocDate":"03-JAN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20120123001140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120123001140","DocDate":"29-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2009111115111004","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009111115111004","DocURL":"13-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2009111115111004","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009111115111004","DocDate":"13-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20090528033115","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090528033115","DocDate":"18-MAY-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea-Bissau","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
