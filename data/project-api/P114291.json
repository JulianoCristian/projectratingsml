The closing date for the project will be extended from June 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013. The original credit was in the amount of SDR 107.6 million (US$160 million equivalent), signed on June 9, 2009 and became effective on August 26, 2009.  The purpose of this extension request is to allow for the completion of redemption of outstanding subsidy vouchers, the completion of outstanding procurement contracts, the completion of a performance audit, and the preparation for an electronic voucher system to be piloted in 2013. During the last three years, the project has successfully distributed more than 15 million input vouchers to over 3 million farm households, supporting the purchase and application of over 500,000 tons of fertilizer and over 50,000 tons of improved seed. This has supported the production of at least 1.5 million tons of additional maize, reducing the country's dependence on grain imports and food aid.  The expanded maize production made possible by this project led to the lifting of the grains trade ban in late 2011. Project performance is currently rated as satisfactory for achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO), as elaborated above.  However, overall implementation progress is assessed as moderately satisfactory due to procurement delays, and the slow settlement of the Government's counterpart funding. The latter has contributed this year to an extended delay in the payment of agro-dealers for outstanding subsidy vouchers.  The Government is now current on it counterpart funding obligations.  As of June 22, 2012 the disbursement rate stands at 95 percent with US$155.3 million of disbursed.
