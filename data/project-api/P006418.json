The sector rehabilitation is to be achieved through several methods.  They include reducing the investment program to minimum acceptable levels; following appropriate investment priorities; balancing the composition of the program among generation, transmission and distribution, and increasing substantially the sector's internal cash generation, mainly through tariff increases.  Other components to be used to achieve sector rehabilitation involve increasing, through Government contributions, the sector's equity capital; and promoting energy conservation.  The proposed loan will help the Government provide the equity contributions required by the sector in 1986.  These contributions will be given to the utilities with the most urgent financial needs, on the basis of rehabilitation plans acceptable to the Bank."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"500,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"PP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment","code":"PP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092735","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092735","DocDate":"31-MAY-1986"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
