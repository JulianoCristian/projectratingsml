Energy conservation will be enhanced, and environmental conditions will improve, through transmission, and distribution of network rehabilitation, substation modernization, and new technologies. Pricing policies, and commercial practices will allow the competitive development of Rigas Siltums, to achieve eventual privatization. The two main components will: 1) supply, and install automated consumer substations to allow the introduction of variable flow, thus facilitate the dispatching of heat load from the current, underutilized plant, and in turn facilitate energy savings for consumers. Pipe sections will be replaced as needed to abate leaks, while construction of a pipeline interconnection, and installation of pumping stations will facilitate the right, and left bank networks heat demand; 2) include institutional support through consulting services in procurement, project financial reporting, and disbursement. In addition consulting services will be provided to assist in the evaluation for an applicable two-tier heat tariff, emphasizing its suitability through public awareness campaigns. Advisory services will improve municipal social assistance programs, and an evaluation of ownership options will be developed."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Latvia!$!LV","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"36,160,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"LV","sectorcode":"LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development"],"themecode":"71","mjthemecode":"9,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000094946_02073004014625","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02073004014625","DocDate":"26-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703525332","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703525332","DocDate":"03-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00071906244568","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00071906244568","DocDate":"30-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00040806064588","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00040806064588","DocDate":"21-DEC-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Latvia"}},"facets":{}}
