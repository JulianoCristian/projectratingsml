To achieve the above, a three phase Adaptable Program Loan was prepared and is spread over a period of twelve years. The key development objectives of this project (APL1) are to (i) improve the living conditions in under-serviced neighborhoods in up to five provincial capital cities and; (ii) prepare the systems, capacity, and regulatory foundation and initiate market based housing sector reforms. The Project objectives will be achieved through three main components: (i) urban upgrading and community enabling programs in up to 5 selected cities; (ii) technical assistance for housing sector
