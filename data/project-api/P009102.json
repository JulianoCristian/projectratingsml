The project will consist of: a) support for privatization, including the preparation and implementation of privatization transactions; a public information campaign to promote the Government's privatization agenda and broaden public support for it; the strengthening of Public Participation Adminstration and the strengthening of the capacity of Treasury to manage the debt liabilities of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to be privatized; b) social safety net measures, including labor adjustment programs to determine the extent of labor displacement in individual SOEs, assess the demand for labor services, and provide counseling, retraining and small business assistance through local institutions; the strengthening of institutions responsible for labor programs; and studies to analyze options for the reform of social insurance/pension systems in Turkey and develop a unique identifier system for Turkish citizens; c) the preparation of a Regional Development Plan to diversify the economic base of the Zonguldak Region, where a high concentration of layoffs in steel and coal mining operations is likely; and d) studies to develop a regulatory framework for the privatization of the telecommunications sector and establish a coordinated strategy for the private provision of infrastructure services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Central
