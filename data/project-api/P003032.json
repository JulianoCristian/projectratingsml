The project faces few technical, commercial or managerial risks. There are some risks of delays in project implementation due to the general economic conditions in Zaire. The main risks will be a deterioration of the Company's financial situation if the government failed to increase sugar prices to reflect production costs, or to provide foreign exchange to purchase agricultural inputs, spare parts and supplies. To reduce these risks, the Government has agreed that sugar prices will be reviewed whenever required and has established a mechanism to allocate foreign exchange to Compagnie Sucriere."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of the Congo!$!ZR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"26,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ZR","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925055516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925055516","DocDate":"26-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902363857","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902363857","DocDate":"31-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04530_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04530_1_0","DocDate":"23-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0452e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0452e_1_0","DocDate":"23-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228ccb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228ccb_1_0","DocDate":"23-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912492368","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912492368","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100318021111","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100318021111","DocDate":"25-NOV-1980"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"}},"facets":{}}
