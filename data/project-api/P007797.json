Both the Government and management of BNP have expressed their intention to ensure that individual vessel owners be given a first chance over the larger fishing companies to receive the funds of the proposed project and this policy is reflected in the Loan Agreement. In view of this policy, no specific measures to limit the granting of subloans according to size of fishing company are proposed as part of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Panama!$!PA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"3,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PA","sectorcode":"AF","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","code":"AF"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903204269","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903204269","DocDate":"31-JUL-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903190613","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903190613","DocDate":"31-JUL-1971"}],"countryname":"Republic of Panama"}},"facets":{}}
