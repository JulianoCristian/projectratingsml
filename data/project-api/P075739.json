These changes will allow completion of two key components of the project: (a) the privatization transaction of Samoa Tel; and (b) the further strengthening of the regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector, particularly in the areas of interconnection, convergence and downstream effects of privatization. The results of both components are important to the development of the sector. Likewise, full utilization of the credit and adequate monitoring of project implementation and achievement of outcomes will be facilitated."},"country_namecode":"Samoa!$!WS","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Postal services","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"4,480,000","sector":[{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Postal services"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"WS","sectorcode":"BG,CD,CT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,44,40","mjthemecode":"4,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Postal services","code":"CD"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":50},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20111111000508","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20111111000508","DocDate":"01-NOV-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000334955_20090923015010","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090923015010","DocDate":"31-AUG-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201330437","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201330437","DocURL":"28-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201330538","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201330538","DocURL":"28-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02120304010864","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02120304010864","DocDate":"20-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0203070401141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0203070401141","DocDate":"28-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02011104062625","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02011104062625","DocDate":"06-FEB-2002"}],"countryname":"Samoa"}},"facets":{}}
