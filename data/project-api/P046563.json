There are eight project components.  First, water conservancy measures include irrigation and drainage system rehabilitation and improvements, hydropower stations, and transmission lines.  Second, land reclamation will cover non-productive lands with a total area of 75,350 hectares.  Third, land improvement will cover low-yield irrigated lands with a total area of 105,350 hectares.  Fourth, agricultural support services will support on-farm development in terms of seed availability, machinery services, technology transfer, etc.  Fifth, environmental protection and monitoring will improve quality and quantity of ground and surface water.  Sixth, institutional development support will strengthen prefecture and county Project Management Offices (PMOs), self-financing irrigation and drainage districts, and line agencies.  Seventh, Tarim Basin Water Resources Commission support will finance institutional development support and measures on mainstream of the Tarim River to improve water management and water delivery to the lower reaches of the river.
