This would be done through the management and sustainable use of medicinal and herbal plants (M/H) plants for human and livestock needs in the Mujib Nature Reserve and the Central Upper Slopes of the Rift Valley in Jordan, while ensuring effective in-situ protection of threatened habitats and ecosystems in these areas. There are four main components. Component 1, institutional strengthening, is composed of 6 sub-components: establishing a project management unit; developing links between government agencies, the growers of medicinal/herbal plants, the pharmaceutical industry, other producers of M/H plant products, nongovernmental organizations, and consumers; designing an intellectual property rights framework; establishing health and safety standards; establishing a national M/H plants database and gene pool; and designing and implementing a training program. Component 2, the pilot-sites conservation component, has two sub-components, namely the in-situ protection and management of M/H plants and the ex-situ production of rare, endangered and popular M/H plants to relieve in-situ pressure. Component 3 consists of environmental education and public awareness. Component 4 focuses on income generating activities, among them, organic farming certification, standards for M/H plants for harvested products, processing standards for M/H plant manufactured products, quality control of M/H plant products, product development, market identification, and facilitating access to microcredit."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Project Paper,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"JO","sectorcode":"AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"59,80,86","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20110318013750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20110318013750","DocDate":"01-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333038_20091207223916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20091207223916","DocDate":"01-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20090605013727","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090605013727","DocDate":"03-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333038_20090204225553","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090204225553","DocDate":"26-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000334955_20090702024925","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090702024925","DocDate":"21-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052611524851","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052611524851","DocDate":"23-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03050104002120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03050104002120","DocDate":"20-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0205300416533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0205300416533","DocDate":"19-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02052404020622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02052404020622","DocDate":"14-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02121104124638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02121104124638","DocDate":"05-FEB-2003"}],"countryname":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
