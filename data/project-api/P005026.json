The project will consist of three different components: (i) an extension of the old Aswan hydropower station; (ii) the completion of the Shoubrah El Kheima Thermal Power Station, north of Cairo; and (iii) the rehabilitation and extension of distribution facilities in urban, suburban and rural areas outside Cairo and Alexandria. Specifically the project will comprise: (i) four 67.5 MW Kaplan turbines; (ii) a 300 MW steam electric generating unit; and (iii) about 7,000kms of 11-kv and 380/220 volts lines and 250 MW of distribution transformer capacity. The Qattara Hydropower and Renewable Energy Resources Project Authority will be responsible for the construction of the hydropower component, the Egyptian Electricity Authority for the thermal power unit and the Rural Electricification Authority for the regional electrification component. The project will meet primarily industrial needs and also supply growing urban and rural demands. Physical risks of the project are those related to difficult underwater excavations for the hydropower component. Also, there are certain risks related to EEA's financial performance."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"127,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924172251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924172251","DocDate":"28-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912491143","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912491143","DocDate":"30-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902355066","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902355066","DocDate":"30-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e95ed0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95ed0_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e95d82_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95d82_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e96225_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96225_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0421d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0421d_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUN-1980"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
