Project components include: (i) extension, credit and other agricultural support services; (ii) regularization of land tenure; (iii) construction and improvement of rural roads; and (iv) provision of potable water, primary health care services and school facilities. The main risk which this project faces is an institutional one. Ecuador's agricultural public sector has traditionally been weak and uncoordinated, resulting in frequent delays in project execution. Close supervision and technical assistance have been included in the proposed project to help compensate such risks. Additionally, the Government has established a Secretariat for Integrated Rural Development in order to provide the coordination that is needed for this type of multi-sector project. This new agency is expected to facilitate this project's execution."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925065610","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925065610","DocDate":"13-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97680_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97680_1_0","DocDate":"12-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902373380","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902373380","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912525022","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912525022","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
