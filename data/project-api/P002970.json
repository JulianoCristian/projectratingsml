The project supports rehabilitating priority links on the national trunk roads network and upgrading feeder roads in selected districts. It also develops strategic directions in road sector planning and management capability: it examines the use of labor-based technologies and construction methods in road maintenance and repair, the build up of institutional capacity, the increased use of private contractors and consultants in program execution, and the development of sustainable revenue sources. Specifically, the project's three components upgrade the main roads to paved (bitumen) standard; finance consultant services to supervise civil works and to carry out a number of sector policy and management studies along with sponsoring workshops and seminars; and hire external auditors."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":97},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"90,980,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"TA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"78","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":97}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000386194_20110701052557","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110701052557","DocDate":"21-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20090309071250","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090309071250","DocDate":"15-JAN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022510532477","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022510532477","DocDate":"22-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00011205340692","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00011205340692","DocDate":"31-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99061606174522","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99061606174522","DocDate":"03-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703525637","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703525637","DocDate":"04-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00011205340691","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00011205340691","DocDate":"31-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00011205340690","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00011205340690","DocDate":"31-MAR-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
