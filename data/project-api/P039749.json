Placed within the strategic context, the program will contribute to the achievement of macroeconomic stability and growth. The Health Sector Reform Project supports the first phase of the reform program, and its main objectives are to contain growth in health expenditures, improve health care services, and assure efficiency in the use of physical facilities. The project components include: 1) The rationalization of the investment strategy for health delivery systems, which will directly support economic efficiency improvement. A health facility masterplan will incorporate norms and standards, overall needs, and public and private sector capacity. 2) The development of health information systems, which will provide relevant and timely epidemiological data and improve management information systems for patients record keeping, services, inventory, and personnel. 3) The improvement of private hospital financing will establish accounting standards and adjust budgetary allocations efficiently. 4) The reform of the pharmaceutical sector will promote generic substitution, rationalize the use of drugs, and reform drug procurement. 5) A continuing reform process will be addressed, and special studies conducted. Technical expertise recruits will aim at exploring alternative reform proposals."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"JO","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"67","mjthemecode":"8,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050601121727","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050601121727","DocDate":"31-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200404883","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200404883","DocURL":"08-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052613330419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052613330419","DocDate":"08-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200404883","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200404883","DocDate":"08-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99032505565942","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99032505565942","DocDate":"05-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903284860","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903284860","DocDate":"17-DEC-1998"}],"countryname":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan"}},"facets":{}}
