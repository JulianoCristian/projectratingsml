Activities financed by the CF are within the ESDP's plan of action over the period 2008-2010.  The project has made significant progress and is poised to achieve a 100 percent disbursement of grant proceeds through the six month extension. However, a few important activities have incurred unforeseen delays: a) primary school construction that experienced delays due to heavy rain; b) delivery of three million textbooks for the three coming school years; and c) 30,000 student desks. Therefore, an extension of the closing date will ensure completion of those activities. The additional time will allow the project to finalize activities that will support progress towards achieving project development objective (PDO) by: 1) creating additional spaces for students and thus increasing the total number of beneficiaries (including girls): and 2) creating a better learning environment that will entice students to stay in school by providing additional student desks and textbooks."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania!$!MR","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"14,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"MR","sectorcode":"BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0002379024","geoLocName":"Wilaya du Hodh el Gharbi","latitude":"16.58333","longitude":"-9.8333302","country":"MR"},{"geoLocId":"0002379216","geoLocName":"Wilaya du Guidimaka","latitude":"15.38333","longitude":"-12.13333","country":"MR"},{"geoLocId":"0002379384","geoLocName":"Wilaya du Gorgol","latitude":"16","longitude":"-12.83333","country":"MR"},{"geoLocId":"0002380635","geoLocName":"Wilaya du Brakna","latitude":"17.25","longitude":"-13.4","country":"MR"},{"geoLocId":"0002381344","geoLocName":"Wilaya de l'Assaba","latitude":"16.58333","longitude":"-11.58333","country":"MR"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"65","mjthemecode":"8,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":86},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20121003004719","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20121003004719","DocDate":"28-SEP-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011121117553983","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011121117553983","DocDate":"11-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20110929002422","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110929002422","DocDate":"20-SEP-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20110929002807","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110929002807","DocDate":"20-SEP-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011032916120007","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011032916120007","DocDate":"29-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000076092_20080325150033","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080325150033","DocDate":"18-MAR-2008"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania"}},"facets":{}}
