To that end, the project includes (i) systems investigation and monitoring; and (ii) extension to disseminate improved technology, organize Range and Livestock Associations (RLAs) and support village development initiatives.  It further includes (iii) agropastoral adaptive trials and forestry programs; (iv) animal health and livestock production; and (v) water and infrastructure development.  Lastly, the project provides for (vi) conservation to protect key flora and fauna in the project area and the Northern Rangelands; (vii) training to provide continued support to the University and short-term and medium-term training opportunities overseas; and (viii) project management to manage project and National Range Agency (NRA) activities in the region.  The main benefits of the project will derive from the reduced degradation of the rangelands."},"country_namecode":"Somali Democratic Republic!$!SO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"19,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SO","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3961214132749","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214132749","DocDate":"09-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030915435049","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030915435049","DocDate":"09-FEB-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08368_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08368_1_0","DocDate":"18-OCT-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927033813","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927033813","DocDate":"15-SEP-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927033701","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927033701","DocDate":"15-SEP-1988"}],"countryname":"Somali Democratic Republic"}},"facets":{}}
