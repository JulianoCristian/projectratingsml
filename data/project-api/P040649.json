The number of potential beneficiaries is estimated to reach 1.5 million, close to one third of the population. The project is expected to have a significant impact on reducing war-induced poverty throughout Sierra Leone, particularly by helping reinvigorate the local economy. The project will entail two components: 1) Emergency Recovery Support Fund, and related institutional support to the National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement, and Rehabilitation and partners will facilitate the social and economic recovery of communities and the restoration of basic social and economic services through demand-driven, community-oriented projects that target individuals, groups and the community affected by the conflict. 2) Training and Employment Program, and related institutional support to the National Committee on Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration will support the social and economic reintegration of former combatants through targeted counseling, training, and employment creation efforts."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Sierra Leone!$!SL","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"SL","sectorcode":"WZ,AZ,EZ,JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,58,71,57,54","mjthemecode":"6,7,9,7,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040107123332","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040107123332","DocDate":"22-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_99122006282964","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99122006282964","DocDate":"21-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183445","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183445","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Sierra Leone"}},"facets":{}}
