The goal of the national program is to improve nutritional status to the extent that malnutrition will no longer be a public health problem. The project consists of two components. The first, the Service Component, is comprised of two sub-components: Area-based community nutrition services improve behavioral practices in critical areas such as breastfeeding, timely introduction of solid foods, and increased food intake during pregnancy. It also increases awareness and treatment of malnutrition in the primary care health system and provides food security and income-generating activities to the poorest households in the community. The second sub-component funds a foundation promoting and protecting breastfeeding; funds a program for national micro-nutrient supplements; and provides technical assistance to draft legislation on fortification and food quality standards. The second component, the Project Support and Institutional Development Component, consists of three sub-components: project management and institutional development; monitoring, evaluation, and operations research; and training and behavioral change communications. This component strengthens the management capacities of communities and nongovernmental organizations."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"92,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"BG,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rule of law","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,33,59,68,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,3,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070430112717","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070430112717","DocDate":"15-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201125285","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201125285","DocURL":"14-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201125285","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201125285","DocDate":"14-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00051005302083","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051005302083","DocDate":"25-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703525128","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703525128","DocDate":"03-MAR-2000"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
