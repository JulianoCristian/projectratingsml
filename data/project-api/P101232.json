It is the first of three development policy lending (DPL) operations to support Uganda's poverty reduction strategy. The operations cover the period 2010-13. The government's previous poverty reduction strategies reduced the share of households living in poverty from 44 percent in 1997, to 38 percent in 2001/02, and to 31 percent in 2005/06. The operation takes into account the impact of the global slump on the Ugandan economy, which became more evident in 2009/10. In 2008/09, the global economic slowdown resulted in an underperformance in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 1.5 percentage points and a shortfall in fiscal revenues equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP. This was underpinned by slowdown in exports and lower foreign direct investment, which constrained private investment and threatened to reduce the pace of poverty reduction. Preliminary estimates suggest the impact was worse than anticipated in 2009/10 as domestic demand is feared to have slumped. The fiscal stimuli envisaged through government's earlier strategy for public investment through infrastructure spending in the 2008/09 and 2009/10 has been constrained by implementation and absorption capacity issues. To ensure that the economy remains robust and to be able to address any vulnerability to growth and poverty reduction, fiscal policy will have to remain accommodative. To this end, supplementary resources provided under the Crisis Response Window will help the government maintain investment and counteract the global crisis, while the PRSC support for efficiency gains in public spending can in turn help to address implementation and absorptive capacity issues."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":11},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":34},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Summary of Discussion,Program Document","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"WZ,EZ,JA,TZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"70,39,27,25,85","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,2,2,4,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":22},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":11},{"Name":"Education","Percent":11},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20140227114932","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20140227114932","DocDate":"27-JAN-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012071112480860","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012071112480860","DocDate":"11-JUL-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000171540_2011011114323567","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2011011114323567","DocDate":"24-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000356161_20101019042511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101019042511","DocDate":"30-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100913023346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100913023346","DocDate":"30-AUG-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
