The closing date for the project will be extended from March 31, 2011 until June 30, 2011. The extension is necessary to allow ongoing works and service contracts to come to successful closure. Doing this will enable the project to meet its set development objectives. The implementing agency, the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation of the Government of Southern Sudan (MWRI) has submitted in writing its request on February 14, 2011, and has prepared an updated procurement plan. MWRI made a formal request to extend the project closing date from March 31, 2011 to September 30, 2011. However, since the overall closing date of the Multi Donor Trust Fund - Southern Sudan (MDTF-S) is up to June 30, 2011 and anticipating an additional three months to be sufficient to complete the remaining activities, only a three month extension request up to June 30, 2011 is proposed. This will be the second extension of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of South Sudan!$!SS","sector1":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"SS","sectorcode":"WC,WA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85","mjthemecode":"11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":50},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120726235756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120726235756","DocDate":"18-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011050219073034","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011050219073034","DocDate":"02-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000386194_20110401014134","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110401014134","DocDate":"16-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000386194_20110401013520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110401013520","DocDate":"08-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010121012185497","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010121012185497","DocDate":"10-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000020953_20070206141517","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070206141517","DocDate":"31-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000020953_20070206142727","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070206142727","DocDate":"31-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000090341_20061206094712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061206094712","DocDate":"06-DEC-2006"}],"countryname":"Republic of South Sudan"}},"facets":{}}
