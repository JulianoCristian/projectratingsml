The project has two components: population and health; and community development. The population and health component will build upon existing successful pilot programs for self-management and cost-recovery to establish services capable of ensuring cost-effective and sustainable provision of comprehensive and good quality health care, including family planning and AIDS control services.

In the second component, complementary community development activities as well as activities to encourage sustainable economic development will be supported through a CDSF.
