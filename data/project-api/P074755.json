In these states, the Project will support four components to: (a) strengthen institutional capabilities, organizational culture and knowledge diffusion; (b) strengthen efficiency and effectiveness of judicial services; (c) improve judicial transparency; and (d) increase access to justice for all users; as well as support Project coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and learning, including consultation with Project stakeholders. In future projects, additional state judiciaries would benefit. The Project would fund subprojects or separate projects in \"participating states.\" Each of these subprojects would be complete in themselves, consisting of the design and implementation of integrated state judicial branch modernization plans consistent with the Project's objective."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican
