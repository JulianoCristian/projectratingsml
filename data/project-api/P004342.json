The project consists of four sectoral subprojects, (railways, urban transport, road freight transport and roads), each with a physical and technical assistance component, and a component to advise on sector policy and assist in the implementation of the project. The project will focus on: 1) rehabilitation of the transport fleet in railways, urban transport and trucking; 2) rehabilitation of paved roads; 3) preparation for restructuring of selected transport enterprises; and 4) policy advice, technical assistance and training to related sectoral agencies and private trucking operators. The project has been designed to complement the efforts of other donors active in Mongolia. Hence, it excludes the aviation sector and does not focus on construction in the highway sector; and includes railway investments not covered by Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund assistance."},"country_namecode":"Mongolia!$!MN","sector1":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":36},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and
