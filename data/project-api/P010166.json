The project would also assist the establishment of national skills standards applicable to all training institutions and incorporation of these standards for appointment and promotion in the public service. The IDA credit would help finance facilities and equipment for the Institute of Engineering of Tribhuvan University to establish a new training center at Pokhara in the Western Development Region which would: (a) expand certificate level training programs initiated under the First Project; and (b) initiate a one-year craft level training program. Related staff training and specialist services would be partially financed by a grant from the United Nations Development Programme. Three studies would also be carried out through the Ministry of Education to develop project proposals for investments in primary, secondary, and non-formal education."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"14,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"NP","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000333038_20081110022038","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081110022038","DocDate":"14-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902383615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902383615","DocDate":"31-DEC-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05800_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05800_1_0","DocDate":"22-DEC-1981"}],"countryname":"Nepal"}},"facets":{}}
