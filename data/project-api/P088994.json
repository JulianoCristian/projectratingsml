The objectives will be achieved through: (i) rehabilitating and strengthening the Taunsa Barrage and associated structures; (ii) renovation and modernization of gates, hoists and operating and control facilities; (iii) improving operation and maintenance capability; and (iv) rehabilitation design studies for other barrages in Punjab. The major benefits of the Project stem from securing irrigation of the cultivated lands in the command areas of over two million acres in the two canal commands of Muzaffargarh and Dera Ghazi Khan, and through the Taunsa-Panjnad Link Canal to supplement water supply to Panjnad Headworks canals. Other benefits from the rehabilitation of the barrage include: (a) long-term and effective functioning of the critical oil and gas pipelines, and telephone lines; and (b) ensuring continued availability of vital rail and road links of strategic importance between the Punjab and the Sindh and Balochistan provinces."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"123,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Resettlement Plan,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Technical Annex,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,78","mjthemecode":"10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20100715001314","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100715001314","DocDate":"01-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20060607154830","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060607154830","DocDate":"01-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000012009_20051220143517","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051220143517","DocDate":"19-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000160016_20051222113958","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051222113958","DocDate":"29-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20051116150810","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20051116150810","DocDate":"16-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010041410065850","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010041410065850","DocDate":"24-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000014464_2010050514294659","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010050514294659","DocDate":"24-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000090341_20050228093536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050228093536","DocDate":"18-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000012009_20050727143640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050727143640","DocDate":"15-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000160016_20041109153932","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20041109153932","DocDate":"26-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20040929160638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040929160638","DocDate":"26-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20040608100415","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040608100415","DocDate":"04-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20040608110819","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040608110819","DocDate":"04-JUN-2004"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
