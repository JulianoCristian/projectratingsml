Through the environmental management facility (EMF) component, environmental and social problems resulting from the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd. (ZCCM) operations prior to privatization (including the Government's permanent obligations), will be addressed in accordance to the country's environmental laws and regulations. A consolidated environmental management plan (CEMP) will be prepared, to identify priority financing, and provide the criteria for funding subprojects. Moreover, this CEMP will form the basis for managing environmental issues related to the Copperbelt, and Kabwe over a 25 year period, within the broader context of environmental, and social sustainability. The second component, will strengthen the environmental regulatory framework, by providing assistance to the Government, to ensure that historical, and future environmental liabilities arising from mining activities, are handled in compliance with national environmental, and social safeguards. To this end, capacity building will be supported, namely at the Environmental Council of Zambia, and authorizing agencies, so as to review environmental impacts assessments, negotiate management activities with investors, issue pollution permits, monitor compliance, and collect fees and fines. This component will also provide assistance to strengthen nongovernmental organizations, and training institutions, to increase national capacity in addressing environmental issues related to the mining sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"Mining and other extractive","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Mining and other extractive"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Resettlement Plan,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Resettlement Plan,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"LB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"82,84","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Mining and other extractive","code":"LB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20111227224047","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20111227224047","DocDate":"22-OCT-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011032717294542","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011032717294542","DocDate":"27-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.2","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000012009_20040315162712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040315162712","DocDate":"01-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03030604005362","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03030604005362","DocDate":"14-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02022004002362","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022004002362","DocDate":"30-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_02121104124743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02121104124743","DocDate":"30-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00112305435537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112305435537","DocDate":"05-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02022104015671","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022104015671","DocDate":"13-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000112742_20040305152701","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20040305152701","DocDate":"01-FEB-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
