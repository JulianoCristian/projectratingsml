There are three project components: 1) Water supply component will give villagers in all 27 counties the opportunity to invest in improved water supplies. Households can choose whether to invest in individual household connections or to rely on community standposts. 2) Sanitation and health education component will help to reduce incidences of waterborne disease by a) making available information on improved latrine designs, their investment costs, and economic and health benefits through sponsoring village information sessions about water supply, improved latrines, and related hygiene practices; b) financing improved latrine facilities on a demonstration basis in project village schools and in selected households in each project village; and c) identifying specific types of behavioral change that will improve health conditions. 3) Project management component will be in charge of the county, province, and national project offices; provide technical assistance and training; finance project management and supervision activities; and carry out baseline surveys."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u7b2c\u56db\u519c\u6751\u4f9b\u6c34\u548c\u536b\u751f\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u8865\u5145\u4e2d\u56fd\u5728\u6539\u5584\u519c\u6751\u4f9b\u6c34\u548c\u536b\u751f\u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u6240\u505a\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u9879\u76ee\u4e3a\u5b89\u5fbd\u3001\u798f\u5efa\u3001\u8d35\u5dde\u3001\u6d77\u5357\u7b49\u56db\u4e2a\u7701\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d37\u6b3e\u8d44\u91d1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3a\u8d2b\u56f0\u53bf\u7684\u519c\u6751\u5efa\u8bbe\u4f9b\u6c34\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u5efa\u7684\u4f9b\u6c34\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0d\u4f46\u7b26\u5408\u536b\u751f\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u65b9\u4fbf\u53d6\u7528\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u6751\u6c11\u7684\u53d6\u6c34\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u589e\u52a0\u6d88\u8d39\u3002\u6b64\u5916\u8d44\u91d1\u4e5f\u7528\u4e8e\u666e\u53ca\u536b\u751f\u5065\u5eb7\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7ba1\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":3},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":3},"sector4":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"46,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Brief,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"EP,JA,WA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development"],"themecode":"70,78","mjthemecode":"10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":91},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":3},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":3},{"Name":"Education","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070430134706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070430134706","DocDate":"16-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333038_20081029035504","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081029035504","DocDate":"01-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030314064127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030314064127","DocDate":"17-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032610555328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032610555328","DocDate":"17-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042710052429","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042710052429","DocDate":"17-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99052708473642","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99052708473642","DocDate":"10-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911064065","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911064065","DocDate":"16-APR-1999"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
