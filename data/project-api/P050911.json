In order to achieve an economic development along the coastal areas, the project aims at effectively integrate environmental planning and management, through the development, test and evaluation of different methods. To this end, the project includes five components. First the establishment of an institutional and legal framework, thus facilitating intersectoral planning and participation. With the creation of agencies and other groups, in addition to legislation drafting, this component will support coastal management through training and mass media awareness. Secondly, the protection and management of forests and natural habitats will be supported for biodiversity conservation. A third component is the establishment of a coastal environment quality monitoring and information system, setting standards along major point sources of pollution. The fourth component addresses the evaluation of coastal erosion, towards an integrated water management. Finally, the development of a national oil spill contingency plan and marine oil pollution control plan will provide support towards a Regional Black Sea Strategy Action Plan."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"4,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GE","sectorcode":"JB,BH,AZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,84,80,85,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":32},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080307012345","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080307012345","DocDate":"31-AUG-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01060604005324","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060604005324","DocDate":"20-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030410525255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030410525255","DocDate":"27-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910492058","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910492058","DocDate":"24-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929095611","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929095611","DocDate":"30-JUL-1998"}],"countryname":"Georgia"}},"facets":{}}
