The components of the project are: (a) Distribution Automation System comprising: (1) six control centers with SCADA facilities, and consolidation reporting facilities in PEA's Head Office; (2) remote-controlled distribution line switching equipment; (3) fault indicators, remote terminal units and ultra high frequency communications links; and (4) construction of six control centers and modification of existing substations; (b) upgrading distribution in South Thailand comprising the construction of transmission lines and associated substations; (c) consulting services for the detailed design and project management of the Distribution Automation System, including training of PEA technical staff, and upgrading distribution in south Thailand; and (d) technical assistance for the rationalization of PEA's interfacing arrangements with EGAT and study of issues and options for the regulatory framework of the energy sector."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,40,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050805095825","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050805095825","DocDate":"13-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200262886","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200262886","DocURL":"27-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200263087","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200263087","DocURL":"27-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214121533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214121533","DocDate":"17-APR-1996"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
