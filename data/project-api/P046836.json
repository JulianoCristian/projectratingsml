A further project objective is to harmonize national management programs in order to achieve, to the maximum extent possible, the reversal of increasing environmental degradation. This project has eight components. They include: 1) fisheries management; 2) fisheries research; 3) fisheries extension, policies, and laws; 4) water hyacinth control; 5) water quality monitoring; 6) industrial and municipal waste management; 7) land use and wetland management; and 8) policy and institutional framework."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":44},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":16},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":14},"sector5":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"12,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Animal production"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,GEF Project Document,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"AJ,AZ,BC,WZ,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"80,82,85,84","mjthemecode":"11,11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":44},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":16},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":14},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123421925","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123421925","DocURL":"10-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123421724","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123421724","DocDate":"10-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123421523","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123421523","DocURL":"10-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123421925","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123421925","DocDate":"10-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123421523","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123421523","DocDate":"10-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"GEF Project Document (PD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PD","EntityID":"000009265_3961219144602","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219144602","DocDate":"30-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214131704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214131704","DocDate":"18-JUN-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
