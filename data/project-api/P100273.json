The changes include: (i) aligning the project's development objective (PDO) to the Global Pandemic Avian Influenza (GPAI) PDO' to expand the scope of planned interventions to include other zoonotic diseases as a new target outcome, and yet preserve the integrity of the original project design related to Avian Influenza (AI); (ii) supporting the development of a National Pandemic Plan for addressing current and future pandemics; (iii) constructing a new animal health laboratory versus the original planned reconstruction; (iv) reallocating unused financing from the compensation fund and eligible emergency imports in light of new Government arrangements for emergency financing, including for pandemics; and (v) strengthening the project results framework to address the above. This restructuring is a timely response to both the recently declared H1N1 pandemic and further extending the project's impact on general preparedness for zoonosis outbreaks given developments in public emergency financing arrangements."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration
