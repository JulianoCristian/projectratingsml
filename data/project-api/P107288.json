Both the urgent need for financial assistance in a highly uncertain global context and the current focus of policy makers on fiscal issues make a stand-alone operation a more appropriate instrument for Bank support to the authorities at this juncture than a new series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs). This approach will also provide time to the authorities for the design and implementation of a medium-term reform agenda that could be supported under the next series of PRSCs. Policies and reforms supported by this operation are well aligned with Senegal's poverty reduction strategy paper. The operation is also fully consistent with the objectives of the Bank's FY07-10 country assistance strategy. The country is trying to emerge from its 2008 fiscal problems at a time of extraordinary stress in the global environment. The major channels of transmission of the global economic recession to the Senegalese economy are exports, remittances, tourism, and foreign direct investment. Being a very open economy, Senegal's exposure to the global crisis is significant. However, the already evident strength of the authorities' response to their 2008 fiscal problems is turning out to provide a critical boost that, together with a prudent macroeconomic management going forward, should help Senegal weather the global crisis, at least through 2009."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":15},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":10},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":15},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":50},"theme5":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":10},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"AT,BH,JA,TI,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"67,27,26,30,39","mjthemecode":"4,2,2,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways","code":"TI"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":60},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20130919110641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130919110641","DocDate":"08-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2009080612134553","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009080612134553","DocDate":"10-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20090618001301","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090618001301","DocDate":"10-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090601152400","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090601152400","DocDate":"05-MAY-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
