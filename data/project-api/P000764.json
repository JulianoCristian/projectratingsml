The objectives will be met by providing assistance for: 1) capacity building of the Regional Governments and water supply and agencies for management of urban water supply and sanitation schemes and rural water supply operations; 2) formulation of policies to ensure long-term financial and managerial viability of water supply operations, establishment of regulatory arrangements and sound investment planning by the Regional Governments and water supply agencies; and 3) short- and medium-term physical rehabilitation, augmentation and establishment of urban water supply and sanitation schemes in war-affected and the most deficient regions. The project will consist of the following components: 1) institutional capacity building, which includes water supply sector capacity building and rural water supply pilot scheme. This component will provide studies, technical assistance, training, equipment, service rigs, mobile workshops, vehicles and the construction of pilot schemes; 2) feasibility and engineering which will consist of water and sanitation scheme feasibility, engineering designs and building works designs; and 3) physical works comprising water and sanitation scheme rehabiliation as well as building works."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"35,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"BC,BH,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,57,78","mjthemecode":"10,7,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":75},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040108162631","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040108162631","DocDate":"23-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121280011","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121280011","DocURL":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121280112","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121280112","DocURL":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121280011","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121280011","DocDate":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121280112","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121280112","DocDate":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019105044","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019105044","DocDate":"08-MAR-1996"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
