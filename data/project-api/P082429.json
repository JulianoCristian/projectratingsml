The World Bank approved on December 15, 2011, a restructuring to the Loan Agreement (LA) for the project for an increase of the threshold of the special account from US$2 million to US$4.5 million. The authorities remain committed to the project and have requested that the Bank reissues the amendment letter for an increase of the threshold of the special account. This increase will help the implementing agencies make progress on the commitments already established and achieve the investment objectives planned under the project period. The project remains in good performance status as documented in the December restructuring paper (RP). The current Implementation Summary Report (ISR) rating (February 13, 2012) is 'satisfactory' for both the progress towards achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO) and the overall Implementation Progress (IP). Financial Management (FM) for the project is currently rated as moderately satisfactory and procurement is rated as satisfactory. The undisbursed balance as of May 2, 2012 was US$18.37 million (16.7% of loan proceeds). This is a level two restructuring, and there is no change in the PDO which continues to be achievable. No new or additional policies are triggered by this proposed restructuring. The World Bank has concluded a project implementation capacity assessment of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MADS), which was considered acceptable to the Bank in terms of procurement and financial management, demonstrating sound capacity of MADS to implement Bank Projects."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
