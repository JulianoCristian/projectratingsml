The components will: 1) include the construction of wastewater conveyance systems, treatment installations, and submarine out-falls in the Sosua region. Existing sewage will be connected to the treatment plant, along with the necessary construction of pumping stations; 2) prepare, and implement the private sector participation process for the provision of water supply services in the Puerto Plata, Sosua, and Cabarete region. It includes procurement drafting for the management of these services in the pilot region, technical assistance to support the evaluation/selection process, and, to design contracting regulations; 3) monitor coastal environment, testing the effectiveness of the small-diameter submarine out-fall, through key indicator variables, and their effect on wastewater disposal; 4) in partnership with the Pan-American Health Organization, training and dissemination practices will form the basis for a case study on the technical viability of small-diameter out-falls; 5) provide technical and financial support to design control regulations on operational, and environmental aspects."},"country_namecode":"Dominican Republic!$!DO","sector1":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":35},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"DO","sectorcode":"BC,WS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48,85,44,84","mjthemecode":"11,4,11,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":65},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":35}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20051220104030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20051220104030","DocDate":"15-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99072807543448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99072807543448","DocDate":"06-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201454074","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201454074","DocURL":"20-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201453973","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201453973","DocURL":"20-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0004270531510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0004270531510","DocDate":"18-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00032306244762","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00032306244762","DocDate":"06-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00112305422127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112305422127","DocDate":"25-FEB-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061710230436","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061710230436","DocDate":"31-OCT-1997"}],"countryname":"Dominican Republic"}},"facets":{}}
