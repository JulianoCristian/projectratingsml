The proposed extension of two months till December 31, 2012 is necessary to bring the project to an orderly closure building on its recent momentum. In particular, this minor extension will allow the project to be consistent with the Nile Basin Decision Support System activities (given the close inter-relationship of activities that is being pursued with ENPM) and allow for continuity into a new overall NBI project that is expected to start on January 1, 2013. This will enable the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office (ENTRO) to systematically complete its internship program under the project and complete the training and capacity development activities related to spatial analysis, model development, knowledge products, and portal development under the project. ENTRO has in place an appropriate action plan to complete this project by the new closing date.
