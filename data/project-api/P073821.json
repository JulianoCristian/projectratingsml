The various project components follow. Prevention and advocacy aims at behavioral change, and the prevention of HIV transmission. To this end, a national reproductive health strategy will provide the conceptual framework to targeted populations, to mitigate the spread of the epidemic, which includes the promotion of safe sex, such as the use of condoms, and, incorporate as well life-skills education, and HIV/AIDS information into educational curricula. Moreover, the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) provide an opportunity for services delivery related to both HIV/AIDS and STIs, through appropriate screening, treatment, and health care. Voluntary counseling, and testing services will be provided, as will, strengthened prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs, through awareness information, counseling, and health care prevention interventions. The treatment, care, and support component shall provide clinical care, and treatment interventions, and, a community home-based care system would expand the provision of health care. The impact mitigation component will target communities, orphans, widows/widowers affected by the epidemic, through public, private, and civil society organizations, while the sectoral mainstreaming component, through the national HIV/AIDS strategic framework, will scale up responsiveness to the epidemic enabling mitigation of the epidemic' impact on labor productivity, and service delivery. Further components will focus on capacity building, and partnerships to implement, and coordinate responsiveness to the epidemic; "},"country_namecode":"Republic of
