The project consists of three components: 1) Augmentation of water supply in Phnom Penh will be done through rehabilitation and extension of the Chruoy Chang War water treatment plant; supply of pipes, ancillary equipment and leak detection equipment; and technical assistance.  2) Augmentation of water supply in Sihanoukville will be done by raising the outlet weir and sealing off the sand spit to increase the storage of raw water; constructing four new groundwater wells; and improving distribution system.  3) Assistance to develop a water and sanitary policy framework for the sector as a whole will be provided through financing of consulting services."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Cambodia!$!KH","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"30,960,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Information Document","countrycode":"KH","sectorcode":"BC,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,39","mjthemecode":"4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333038_20120808004258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120808004258","DocDate":"01-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009486_20050209091721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009486_20050209091721","DocDate":"21-JAN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123475650","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123475650","DocURL":"20-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123475851","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123475851","DocURL":"20-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980313101643","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980313101643","DocDate":"12-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183947","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Cambodia"}},"facets":{}}
