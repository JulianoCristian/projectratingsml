Construction of the planned storage reservoirs, needed to develop available water resources, is already underway and would be continued. Canal capacities would be enlarged to meet peak water requirements, and sufficient control structures would be provided so that the canal systems can respond to changing seasonal and annual water demands. All channels would be extended down to 40-ha outlets, and the conveyance system would be extended down to 8-ha outlets. The project would further provide surveys and investigations for the future Arpa Irrigation Scheme and improve the implementation and management capabilities of MP's Irrigation Department. The project would increase agricultural production and the standard of living of the farmers in MP. Possible risks under the proposed project are those normally associated with irrigation projects in India."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"220,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925082144","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925082144","DocDate":"23-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04316_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04316_1_0","DocDate":"15-SEP-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04314_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04314_1_0","DocDate":"15-SEP-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902381469","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902381469","DocDate":"31-AUG-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912543388","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912543388","DocDate":"31-AUG-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
