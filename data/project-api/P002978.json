The project will support the first five-year phase of the Environmental Action Plan implementation and will consist of two main components. The first will focus directly on capacity building for environmental management at the national level and will support the establishment of the NEMA with financing for vehichles and equipment, incremental staff salaries and operational and maintenance costs on a declining basis and provide limited funds for studies. The second will support the creation of an environmental management system that integrates and strengthen links among all levels and sectors of government and non-government sources thereby building the capacity for coordinated planning and management of natural resources at all levels."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":72},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"11,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"JB,BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,26,82,25","mjthemecode":"2,11,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":72},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":23},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20080811022822","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080811022822","DocDate":"23-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01121204025521","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01121204025521","DocDate":"15-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121271689","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121271689","DocURL":"10-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121271790","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121271790","DocDate":"10-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121271790","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121271790","DocURL":"10-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e23f3b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23f3b_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23f39_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23f39_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019102619","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019102619","DocDate":"14-AUG-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
