The additional grant will help finance costs associated with a financing gap for the construction o f two additional schools, to bring the total number o f schools under the project to 28, approximately the same as the project's original target of 29. Additional financing will allow for the construction of an additional two schools. Additional classroom blocks at these and other schools being constructed under the project will allow the project to achieve its overall target of an additional 10,000 student places at the primary and secondary school levels. The project is expected to achieve its original target of an additional 10,000 student places (3,000 at the primary level, and 7,000 at the secondary level), despite a reduction in the total number of schools to be built, given that additional classroom blocks have either been constructed or are planned at a number of schools built under the project. The project key changes being include: (a) project funds will be deposited in advance into the designated account maintained in Ngultrum's, to be opened at the Bank of Bhutan; and (b) replenishments into the designated account will be based on interim unaudited financial reports and will be processed by department of public accounts on a quarterly basis.
