The purpose of this restructuring paper is to seek management approval to: 1) improve the specificity, measurability and relevance of project indicators to strengthen the Project's results and monitoring framework; (ii) reorganize the Project description to better align the Project's structure with its implementation arrangements and outcomes; (iii) add the design and implementation of communication campaigns and of measures to improve knowledge as activities and corresponding non-consultant services as an expenditure category critical to build and sustain reform momentum;  (iv) add people with disabilities to the list of excluded groups explicitly mentioned as beneficiaries of grants to develop outreach services; and (v) simplify the disbursement schedule by closing three categories of expenditures and reallocating the remaining funds under these categories into a single, new category (seven) to facilitate the effective use of loan proceeds in the final year of project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Serbia!$!YF","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
