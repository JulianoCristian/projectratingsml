The design of this operation has benefited from close collaboration with the Government, development partners, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), and various stakeholders. This operation builds on the decentralization and public sector reforms supported by previous and ongoing World Bank operations. It targets key medium term challenges to improving the quality of service delivery to Rwandan citizens. In recognition of the limited citizen participation and ownership of the development process, the Government has identified the decentralization process as the key focus for its accountable governance reforms. The Bank proposes this operation under challenging circumstances and a fluid aid environment. The financing provided through this operation will help the Government maintain public expenditures and service delivery in priority areas that are relevant for poverty reduction. In addition, while a lack of financial resources may also reduce the Government's ability to implement planned reforms, this operation will help the Government maintain momentum in important reform areas such as capacity building, public financial management (PFM) and social accountability."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":5},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":5},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":35},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":10},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":45},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Summary of Discussion,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"BC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,57,27,30,25","mjthemecode":"2,2,2,7,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":70},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000442464_20130517100007","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130517100007","DocDate":"14-MAY-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000356161_20130425121507","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130425121507","DocDate":"19-APR-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000001843_20130418094315","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130418094315","DocDate":"01-APR-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000001843_20130320150947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130320150947","DocDate":"16-MAR-2013"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda"}},"facets":{}}
