The additional financing would also enable preservation of this capacity and implementation momentum while the second APL (Adaptable Program Lending instrument) phase is under preparation. The Credit supporting the Project was originally extended until December 31, 2005 to support the process leading to local elections to replace appointed rural development community (Communaute Rude de Developpement (CRD)) leaders by democratically elected representatives. These elections are planned for December 18, 2005, and were the sole remaining trigger for the Project's second phase. At the present time, remaining resources from the International Development Association (IDA) for FY06 are, however, insufficient tofinance the project's second phase (estimated at US$35 million); while it is expected that sufficient FY07 resources are available.  Additional Financing, which would have a closing date of June 30,2007, would thus also help bridge the gap between the end of the first phase and the start-up of the second phase, avoiding loss of momentum in the program. Moreover, as the project has been increasingly used as a vehicle for providing services to communities, two Bank operations (the Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project and the Education for All Project) will face implementation problems if the project's funding is interrupted. Following Midterm Review, the Project had scaled-up its geographic coverage from the original target of 100 to 146 CRDs. The Additional Financing will enable the project to continue capacity-building activities, and support the implementation and updating of local development plans in these 146 CRD"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":39},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":16},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"22,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Project Paper,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"JB,WZ,BH,TA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,57,78,59","mjthemecode":"7,10,7,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":39},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":35},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":16},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":5},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20081103230059","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20081103230059","DocDate":"30-SEP-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2006052410083229","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006052410083229","DocURL":"30-JAN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000014464_2006052410083229","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006052410083229","DocDate":"30-JAN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000160016_20060105114356","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060105114356","DocDate":"14-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201040197","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201040197","DocURL":"19-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201040197","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201040197","DocDate":"19-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910502165","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910502165","DocDate":"25-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000090341_20051227105637","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20051227105637","DocDate":"01-JAN-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
