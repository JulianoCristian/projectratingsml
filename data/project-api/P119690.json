The requested grant will finance a public works program to provide temporary employment to food insecure rural people, by rehabilitating the farm level irrigation and drainage network in selected high food insecurity districts. It thus responds to a significant drop in remittance income due to the global financial crisis, which has severely compromised current household food security, and to the medium-term constraint to domestic food production caused by inadequate drainage and irrigation. The project will also contribute to improved food security at a national level by financing the technical assistance needed to introduce water basin management as the basis for overall management of Tajikistan's water resources.
