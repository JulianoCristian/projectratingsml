Accordingly the project will be focused in the following areas: reform of business enabling environment, reform of financial sector regulatory and supervisory framework, banking sector reform, and enterprise sector reform.  The credit will be a two tranche operation whose design incorporates the lessons from the implementation of PFSAC I, as well as from transition reforms in the Europe and Central A region during the past decade.  The main benefit of the proposed credit will be the facilitation of faster private sector growth and job creation, supported by a healthier and more developed financial system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Serbia!$!YF","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"International financial architecture","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Program Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"YF","sectorcode":"FD,YZ,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"42,34,46,40,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,5,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","code":"FD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"International financial architecture","code":"46"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":50},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":40},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050627113226","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050627113226","DocDate":"20-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000012009_20041101161839","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041101161839","DocDate":"26-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000112742_20030519101849","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20030519101849","DocDate":"14-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03032004092666","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03032004092666","DocDate":"13-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062112095711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062112095711","DocDate":"24-SEP-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Serbia"}},"facets":{}}
