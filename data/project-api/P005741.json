The project consists of five components.  First, the supply response component will support the expansion and maintenance of facilities and equipment in the public sector, and support the encouragement of the private sector to enter the market of both academic service and ancillary service provision.  Second, the quality and relevance component will support adaptation of curricula and pedagogic methods and the enhancement of faculty qualifications and motivation.  Third, the governance and management component will train and empower the managers of the new universities with a view to enabling them to make appropriate and timely decisions regarding material, financial, and human resource use.  Fourth, intensified use of new technologies will introduce the use of new technologies in teaching and learning, and encourage use of computers and informatics by students and faculty.  Fifth, financing will support elaboration and implementation of a comprehensive financing strategy, and increased the equitable cost-recovery for tuition services and non-academic services by users."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"BH,BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48,66","mjthemecode":"8,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050701103901","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050701103901","DocDate":"27-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01032007103625","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032007103625","DocDate":"30-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01032007103626","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032007103626","DocDate":"30-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01032007103524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032007103524","DocDate":"31-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123153701","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123153701","DocURL":"20-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123153701","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123153701","DocDate":"20-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000112742_20040820155648","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20040820155648","DocDate":"20-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929095548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929095548","DocDate":"30-DEC-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
