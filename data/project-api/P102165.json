Activities for which Kosovo will need to assume implementation include six IDA grants, two IDA additional financing grants, six trust funds, and two trust funds grants closed but still disbursing. The changes will result in Kosovo assuming formal responsibility for implementation, reporting and fiduciary obligations associated with the grants involved. The Government of Kosovo will assume all responsibilities and rights from the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kosovo!$!XK","sector1":{"Name":"General
