(CDD) The short-term project objective is to scale out validated project experience in the country, particularly by extending the community-driven development (CDD) strategy of the precursor Community Reintegration and Development Project (a LIL), from 11 to 39 Districts. The specific development objectives are to: (1) strengthen District capacity to lead a process of planning and consultation with local communities, translating their development priorities into sub-projects which are incorporated into Districts' strategic development plans; (2) develop a matching grants system to finance the sub-projects; (3) validate procedures for decentralized project cycle management and financial management; and (4) introduce and promote public awareness programs.   The project includes four components: (1) Institutional Capacity Building: The Project will support the Government's decentralization policy by strengthening institutions' and communities' capacity  to plan, implement, manage, finance, and maintain development activities. Activities to be financed by the project include a broad spectrum of training workshops and on-the-job training at all levels of implementation;  (2) Information, Education and Communications: The component will inform and educate different players at all levels regarding the objectives, activities and modalities of decentralization and the relevant laws and regulations, so that populations are aware of their rights and are included in the processes. The communications strategy will also support the project's participatory monitoring and evaluation, including \"social audits\" for feedback "},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"BC,JB,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"56,26,57,30","mjthemecode":"2,7,2,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20110816003058","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20110816003058","DocDate":"30-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000014464_2010042914204790","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010042914204790","DocDate":"30-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20040524104950","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040524104950","DocDate":"12-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000090341_20040225150552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040225150552","DocDate":"13-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20040209115656","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040209115656","DocDate":"07-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20040120103313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040120103313","DocDate":"08-JAN-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda"}},"facets":{}}
