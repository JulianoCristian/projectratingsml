Taxes on highway users consist of taxes and duties on vehicles and gasoline and registration fees. Total annual collections from all user taxes were on the average about 7 times the total annual expenditure on roads in 1969-71. At the request of the Government, the proposed project includes a study of road user charges and regulations to determine future revenue potential and to examine the merits of possible modification of the existing tax structure. The Highway Project consists of: (a) construction of a four lane divided highway between Nicosia and Morphou (32 km), including supervision by consultants; (b) study of highway planning and organization including the preparation of a high improvement and maintenance program; (c) feasibility studies covering 170 km. of new roads and detailed engineering of about 90 km. of high priority road sections; (d) studies of road user charges and vehicle weight regulations; and (e) training of D.P.W. staff in highway planning and design, construction supervision and highway maintenance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cyprus!$!CY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"CY","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924234508","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924234508","DocDate":"09-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902200980","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902200980","DocDate":"31-MAY-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101911100763","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101911100763","DocDate":"31-MAY-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6aa16_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6aa16_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1973"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cyprus"}},"facets":{}}
