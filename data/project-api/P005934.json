The project consists of constructing 20 silos with an average capacity of 100,000 m tons, each equipped with drying, cleaning and fumigating facilities; minor improvements of rail reception facilities at major ports; and modification of 2,000 box cars for effective grain transport. Through technical assistance, the project will improve the Grain Board's computerized inventory control system and its capabilities for inspection and supervision of primary silos. Also included are a program for training Grain Board staff to operate project silos and pilot dredging for the Port of Bahia Blanca to determine the feasibility of deepening the port access channel. There are no special risks, although inefficient silo management and lower grain production levels than forecast could cause lower volumes of grain to pass through the silos and consequently result in smaller than projected benefits."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"105,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925015314","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925015314","DocDate":"08-FEB-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902294673","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902294673","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f61_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f61_1_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f60_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f60_1_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f5f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f5f_1_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f5e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f5e_1_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f5c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f5c_1_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f5b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f5b_1_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191225594","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191225594","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
