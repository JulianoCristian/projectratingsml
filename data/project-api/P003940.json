Component A provides support to 6 provinces (Aceh, Bali, East Nusa Tenggara Timur, North Sulawesi, West Sumatra and Yogjakarta) whose administrations expand an innovative program of \"teacher professional support\" (SPP) and \"student active learning\" (CBSA). This component also provides more and better quality books and materials, as well as develops policy to enhance teachers' promotion opportunities. Component B comprises a pilot program in East Nusa Tenggara Timur and West Sumatra to upgrade the quality of the most under-served schools by providing compensatory funds to schools in the poorest villages.  Component C has both provincially-based and national elements.  In East Nusa Tenggara Timur and West Sumatra the project introduces and monitors measures to rationalize the respective responsibilities of the Ministry of Education and Culture and Regional Administration Education Services in providing support to primary schools for quality improvement.  It improves financial planning and budgeting by consolidating budgetary information at the school, at the provincial and at the national levels."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":36},"sector3":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"37,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"EP,ET,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"65,70","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":57},{"Name":"Education","Percent":36},{"Name":"Education","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00071505314322","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00071505314322","DocDate":"20-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122493111","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122493111","DocURL":"18-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122493111","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122493111","DocDate":"18-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002103412","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002103412","DocDate":"06-FEB-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002102846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002102846","DocDate":"06-FEB-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
