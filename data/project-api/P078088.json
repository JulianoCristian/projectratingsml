While the risks to this program are considered modest, and Chile's excellent track record in economic management, program implementation, and transparency outweighs potential risks, several areas of implementation could prove difficult for the Government, in particular closing the employment gap among the neediest households, and ensuring the appropriate targeting of Chile Solidario program, which includes historically excluded groups, such as indigenous populations, and, in addition, promoting greater local government and civil society participation may prove difficult."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
