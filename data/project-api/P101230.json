The Bank's PRSC support to Tanzania is provided within a harmonized framework for general budget support (GBS) with thirteen other development partners (DP), comprising a Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), a Partnership Framework Memorandum (PFM) for GBS for the implementation of Tanzania's Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (MKUKUTA), and a joint review process, culminating in a joint Annual Review (AR) in October/November. The framework is designed to support domestic accountability, reduce transaction costs (especially for the government), and encourage the further development and use of Tanzania's own systems. The program structure follows the three pillars of MKUKUTA, namely growth and reduction of income poverty, social well-being, and governance. Given the advanced stage of reforms in Tanzania, these two main strategic areas map out into seven operational policy areas for the PRSC series: agriculture and natural resources; infrastructure; environment for private sector development; monitoring of service delivery in social sectors; public expenditure and financial management; effectiveness of public administration; and anti-corruption and accountability of the state which is receiving heightened attention from the government, domestic stakeholders and development partners."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":30},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":30},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":10},"theme5":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":10},"totalcommamt":"190,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"JA,EZ,AZ,LZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Human development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"67,65,27,30,25","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"2,2,2,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000442464_20130719093433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130719093433","DocDate":"14-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"090224b081af3a9f_2_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081af3a9f_2_0","DocDate":"29-JAN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010060711534084","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010060711534084","DocDate":"22-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20090519020330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090519020330","DocDate":"11-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090223114148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090223114148","DocDate":"26-JAN-2009"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
