For BDC, the project would help finance a proposed investment program of US$30 million for FY84-86. Sixty percent of those investments will be directly in productive sub-projects in industry and agriculture, including commercial mixed farming, dairy farming, agro-processing, and metal fabrication. A significant proportion will be for the development of industrial estates and factory shells. The project would also provide technical assistance of US$800,000 to strengthen NDB's capability for playing a leading role in the development of small- and medium-scale enterprises; and US$200,000 for studies on the future of the declining mining community of Selebi-Phikwe. NDB sub-projects will include textile production, construction, metal-work, woodworks, general wholesale, retail and distribution operations, and four comparatively large operations in commercial agriculture."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Botswana!$!BW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BW","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925184653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925184653","DocDate":"01-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a99_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a99_1_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a98_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a98_1_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a96_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a96_1_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101621","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101621","DocDate":"31-JAN-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Botswana"}},"facets":{}}
