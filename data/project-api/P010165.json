The project would upgrade private and public sector technical, marketing, and credit services and redirect Government incentives affecting the cottage and small industry sector. As a first phase program, the project would focus on the Kathmandu Valley and the Gandaki Zone, testing, developing and improving the various institutions and services. By clarifying the responsibilities of the various agencies, including an expanded role for the private sector, and providing significant technical assistance and training, the project would reduce the risks associated with undertaking such multi-component ventures. Each component includes a strong monitoring and evaluation system, which should facilitate response and corrective action in the face of unforeseen difficulties."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"6,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NP","sectorcode":"IL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","code":"IL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925061838","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925061838","DocDate":"14-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190238281","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190238281","DocDate":"30-NOV-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e057ea_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e057ea_1_0","DocDate":"24-NOV-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e057e8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e057e8_1_0","DocDate":"24-NOV-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912515022","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912515022","DocDate":"31-OCT-1981"}],"countryname":"Nepal"}},"facets":{}}
