The latter objective is essential to CIB so that it can effectively perform as a model development finance institution and a catalyst in the ongoing reform of the investment design and selection system in China. The project further intends to enhance the capability of CIB to mobilize foreign currency resources from international capital markets to provide financing for the industrial sector. This is due to the fact that about 175 state and collective enterprises largely in the light industry sector will receive subloans for modernization and expansion."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u5de5\u4e1a\u4fe1\u8d37\u9879\u76ee\u56db</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u65e8\u5728\u534f\u52a9\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4e2d\u5c0f\u578b\u5de5\u4e1a\u4f01\u4e1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u6295\u8d44\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u6295\u8d44\u94f6\u884c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5176\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u6709\u6548\u5c65\u884c\u6a21\u8303\u53d1\u5c55\u7c7b\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u548c\u73b0\u884c\u6295\u8d44\u9879\u76ee\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u4f53\u5236\u6539\u9769\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u804c\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u62df\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u6295\u8d44\u94f6\u884c\u4ece\u56fd\u9645\u8d44\u672c\u5e02\u573a\u7b79\u96c6\u5916\u5e01\u8d44\u91d1\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u95e8\u63d0\u4f9b\u878d\u8d44\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e4b\u6240\u4ee5\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u8be5\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u8fd9\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u7ea6\u6709175\u5bb6\u56fd\u6709\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u4f01\u4e1a\uff08\u5176\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4e3a\u8f7b\u5de5\u4f01\u4e1a\uff09\u5c06\u5f97\u5230\u9879\u76ee\u5b50\u8d37\u6b3e\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6539\u9020\u548c\u6269\u5efa\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019124108","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019124108","DocDate":"30-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e3683b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3683b_1_0","DocDate":"03-MAR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091750","DocDate":"28-FEB-1987"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
