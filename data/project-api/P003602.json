Specific objectives of this project are to: 1) put in place institutions and policies able to sustain progress on the provincial plan for environmental improvement; 2) improve wastewater collection and treatment in three cities, thus maintaining and raising surface water quality to levels suitable for municipal supply, agricultural, or other purposes; 3) improve wastes management in four cities, thus protecting water and land quality; and 4) identify the highest-impact industrial air and water polluters and significantly reduce their pollution. The project will support policy and institutional innovation, and provide physical works for wastewater handling, air pollution control, and solid waste management. Its components are the following: 1) Wastewater management in Huangshi, Wuhan and Xiangfan, comprising sewer systems, pump stations, and wastewater treatment facilities; 2) municipal wastes management in Huangshi, Wuhan, Xiangfan and Yichang, comprising sanitary landfill development, waste transfer facilities, vehicles and equipment; 3) industrial pollution control; 4) Hubei environmental pollution control fund; 5) water quality monitoring and management in Hubei and Wuhan environmental monitoring centers, comprising water quality monitoring technology, data management equipment, and institutional development; and 6) institutional strengthening through technical assistance and training."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
