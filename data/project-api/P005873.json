This will be accomplished by:  (i) establishing priority research programs to focus on those agricultural activities which are economically important; (ii) establishing multi-disciplinary research teams to work on those programs; (iii) strengthening linkages between research, extension and the farming community; and (iv) establishing a national extension service.  The project components include:  (a) strengthening the Department of Research and Extension; (b) strengthening research activities; and (c) establishing an extension service.  The project will directly benefit about 35,000 farming families (nearly 200,000 persons) through development and application of new technology packages."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925214038","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925214038","DocDate":"22-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e06109_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e06109_1_0","DocDate":"14-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151413","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151413","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904162544","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904162544","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
