Implementation would be carried out over a six-year period and would benefit some l7,l00 families, including the 8,200 families to be settled under the land reform program. In addition, the project includes a study for future development of grain movement and storage and a feasibility study for a second stage rainfed development project in an area south of San Fernando. The project is not expected to have any harmful effects on the environment. Although opening up new lands and creating open areas may have some effect on the biological life in Tamaulipas, over 22,500 ha in the proposed project area are to be retained as a wildlife reserve."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"138,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925114549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925114549","DocDate":"10-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97414_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97414_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUL-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e97413_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97413_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUL-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902401727","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902401727","DocDate":"30-JUN-1982"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
