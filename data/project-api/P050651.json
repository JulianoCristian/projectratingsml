There are three project components. First, the management development and institutional strengthening component will improve the institutional framework for policy development; strengthen the management and implementation capacity at the state, divisional, district, and facility levels; and develop surveillance capacity for major communicable diseases and strengthening Health Management Information System. Second, improving service quality and effectiveness at district and sub-divisional hospitals will renovate/extend district hospitals and upgrade selected community health centers (CHCs) to sub-divisional hospitals and construct training centers at four remaining district hospitals. The third component, improving access and innovative schemes, will a) renovate/extend and upgrade clinical effectiveness at 35 CHCs and enhance their outreach functions; b) improve the referral mechanisms with the primary and tertiary levels and with private health care; c) promote health services in tribal areas and for disadvantaged groups; and d) develop a superspeciality hospital as an innovative scheme for closer cooperation between the public and private sectors."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Malaria","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":16},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"134,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BH,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"60,59,93,67,92","mjthemecode":"8,8,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Malaria","code":"92"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060607101630","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060607101630","DocDate":"26-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201021336","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201021336","DocURL":"14-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201021336","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201021336","DocDate":"14-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201021135","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201021135","DocURL":"14-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201021135","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201021135","DocDate":"14-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910515685","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910515685","DocDate":"05-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929095336","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929095336","DocDate":"05-NOV-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
