It is intended to encourage modernization and increase production and productivity of SMIs. This will promote competitiveness as well as foster employment and help develop SMIs outside the major urban areas. It will also establish a medium to long term lending system. This will operate through a permanent second tier mechanism (the Development Fund for SMIs--FOPYME) which has been set up within the National Development Bank (BANADE). This will strengthen BANADE to enable it to act as a rediscount institution for SMI lending by participating banks. In addition the project will also establish a coordinated technical assistance program for SMIs."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"125,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"IL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise","code":"IL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007230956","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007230956","DocDate":"11-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122142331","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122142331","DocURL":"21-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122142331","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122142331","DocDate":"21-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122142130","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122142130","DocURL":"21-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122142130","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122142130","DocDate":"21-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091943","DocDate":"31-MAR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926070949","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926070949","DocDate":"12-MAR-1987"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
