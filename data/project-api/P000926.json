The project consists of the construction at Takoradi of 300 MW combined-cycle generation capacity, consisting of two combustion turbine generator sets of 100 MW each, a heat recovery boiler and a steam turbine generator to produce an additional 100 MW; generation-associated transmission and associated sub-stations; consulting engineering services to manage and supervise project; and managerial and technical services for the operation and maintenance of the power station. The project will also include components on the development of suitable regulatory arrangements and private participation in the power sector, a program for demand-side management and support for VRA's program of institutional development and capacity building through training and technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
