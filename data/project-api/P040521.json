The main objective is to build small infrastructures in poor rural villages on Java and Sumatra. This also creates cash employment for villagers. Secondary objectives are to increase decentralization and community participation. The project will provide a grant to each of 2,600 of the poorest villagers on Java and Sumatra for building local infrastructures. The villagers will decide what to build, from a menu of choices, and will build it by themselves, the workers being paid by output. Much of the grant may be used to purchase materials. Some equipment will be leased. Field engineers will assist the villagers to plan and implement the works, while also handling financial aspects. Senior engineers and a project management unit will be in charge of the overall planning, coordination and implementation management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":21},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":21},"sector4":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":21},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"140,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BH,WC,AI,TA,WA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development"],"themecode":"76,57,26,78","mjthemecode":"10,2,7,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":21},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":21},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":21},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":21},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20060502091037","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060502091037","DocDate":"21-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01020605302140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01020605302140","DocDate":"26-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200280455","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200280455","DocURL":"15-JAN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214185248","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214185248","DocDate":"13-SEP-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
