There are six project components. 1) Planning and regulation of the healthcare delivery system will cover district health service planning and strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Health. 2) Essential upgrade of district hospitals will undertake phased implementation of an upgrade of essential secondary-level hospital facilities, and training of hospital staff in management of emergency medical cases. 3) Primary health care development will support a global strengthening of primary health care facilities, equipment, and staff skills. 4) Emergency medical services will support further development and extension of integrated, community-based emergency medical services. 5) Public health and disease control will establish legal and regulatory basis for public health and disease control, and develop a capacity to control the main causes of illnesses and premature deaths. 6) Project coordination and management will provide technical assistance and staff training."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"67,89,88","mjthemecode":"8,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":94},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050103114253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050103114253","DocDate":"23-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200432295","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200432295","DocURL":"07-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200432094","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200432094","DocDate":"07-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200432094","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200432094","DocURL":"07-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200432295","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200432295","DocDate":"07-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00061605322440","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00061605322440","DocDate":"26-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929100412","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929100412","DocDate":"29-MAR-2000"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
