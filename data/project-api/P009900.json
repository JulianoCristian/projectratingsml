The project comprises: (a) a pumped storage unit at the existing Bhira hydroelectric station to generate 150 megawatt (MW) of additional peak power by consuming off-peak thermal power; (b) a 220 kilovolt (Kv) transmission line to carry this power to the license area; (c) a gas-based combined cycle unit of 180 MW at the Trombay thermal power plant; (d) a second flue gas desulphurization (FGD) unit to control the sulphur dioxide emissions from the coal and oil buring Unit No. 5 at Trombay; and (e) a review of design and technical specifications and supervision of construction of the Bhira pumped storage scheme and acquisition of know-how for the extension of the FGD facility at Trombay."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"98,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BH,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Urban development"],"themecode":"73,44,74","mjthemecode":"9,4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022112257","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022112257","DocDate":"12-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042011504574","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042011504574","DocDate":"03-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040616042875","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040616042875","DocDate":"03-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929055634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929055634","DocDate":"06-JUN-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
