There are four components to the project, the first component being access to finance linked to technical assistance for micro and small and enterprises (MSEs). The second component is the defaulting loan 'work-out' strategy for viable enterprises. Under this component the project will assist eligible small and medium enterprises (SMEs) whose loans with Bank Perkreditan Rakyat (BPRs) are in arrears to renegotiate and work-out the loans.  The third component is the restoring full capacity and creating opportunities for improving competitiveness of medium size enterprises. Under this component the project will provide credit to eligible medium size enterprises for capital investments towards civil works or replacement of machinery. Finally, the fourth component is the project management and monitoring and evaluation. Under this component the project will finance all costs associated with management, implementation, and supervision of the project incurred by the German Agency for Technical Assistance (GTZ).  This amount includes GTZ's organization overhead of US$0.66 million (6.5 percent of the total estimated costs)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"SME Finance","Percent":72},"sector2":{"Name":"Microfinance","Percent":28},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":60},"totalcommamt":"11,260,000","sector":[{"Name":"SME Finance"},{"Name":"Microfinance"}],"docty":"Agreement,Implementation Status and Results Report,Agreement,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"FI,FH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"41,52","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"SME Finance","code":"FH"},{"name":"Microfinance","code":"FI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":72},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":28}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000362596_2011071811491889","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000362596_2011071811491889","DocDate":"30-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011051811374908","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011051811374908","DocDate":"18-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081af3ba9_2_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081af3ba9_2_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010092310442565","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010092310442565","DocDate":"23-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000333037_20100413001527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100413001527","DocDate":"22-JAN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000334955_20080604035435","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080604035435","DocDate":"02-JUN-2008"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
