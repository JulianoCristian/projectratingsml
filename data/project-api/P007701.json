Specific objectives are to: (a) reduce loss and waste of irrigation water; (b) promote decentralization and private investment in irrigation; (c) increase cropping intensities and yields; and (d) increase crop diversification into higher value crops. The operation has three components. The first component, technological support, communications and training, will assist farmers and their Water Users Organizations (WUOs) to develop and implement improvements in minor network and on-farm irrigation systems. The second component, minor network improvements, is comprised mainly of field surveys, engineering works, small irrigation and drainage networks, water measurement and control structures, access roads, electrical distribution systems, regulating works and equipment. The component is designed to help farmers and their WUOs to improve off-farm minor irrigation and drainage networks related to command areas of between 80 and 500 hectares. The third component, on-farm improvements, is comprised mainly of land leveling, on-farm distribution and drainage systems, control and measurement devices, internal regulating tanks, and pressurized irrigation systems."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
