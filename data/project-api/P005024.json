It would provide physical facilities and technical assistance to NATIONAL and RAKTA to modernize and rehabilitate their existing plants. It would increase capacity at the mills, upgrade operating efficiency and reduce operating costs as well as improve the quality of the companies' products, making them competitive with imports. To help achieve this objective, the two public sector companies would establish two successor companies in the joint venture sector in a manner satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank. This would give autonomy to the successor companies regarding pricing, profit retention, and compensation policies which would enable them to attract and retain qualified employees. The studies included under the project will review the paper and board converting subsector to establish linkages between primary paper consumers and the paper production subsector, conduct an in-depth evaluation of fiber resources in Egypt, and determine detailed priorities for further additions to the two subsectors. The major risk associated with the project relates to the organizational improvements needed in the two companies which is expected to be dealt with."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e961a2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961a2_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e961a0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961a0_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902352110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902352110","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
