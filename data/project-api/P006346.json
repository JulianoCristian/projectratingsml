The project would achieve the first objective by: (a) identifying and delimiting all private and public properties in 31 million ha of rural land in the Northeast region over three and a half years; (b) regularizing the tenure of all rightful occupants; (c) selecting, planning the use of and initially administering lands to be acquired by the Government for redistribution to 130,000 presently landless farmers or farmers whose excessively small properties need to be reallocated; and (d) confirming the titles of all legitimate landowners and providing titles to beneficiaries of land regularization, reallocation or redistribution operations. The second objective would be achieved by: (a) establishing cadestral data banks in each of the nine Northeast states and the State of Minas Gerais for the legal, fiscal and economic administration of private and public lands; (b) strengthening land institutions in staff and equipment; and (c) carrying out various legal, institutional and socioeconomic studies."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925215715","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925215715","DocDate":"08-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094955","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094955","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101251","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
