The project has three components. 1) Improvement to priority infrastructure and services in Conakry includes a) solid waste management, which will increase the level of garbage collection and limit the impact of waste production; b) neighborhood upgrading, which will support rehabilitation and maintenance operations on Conakry's secondary roads; c) primary road network, which will improve traffic at critical blockage points at Conakry. 2) Assistance to secondary cities will support the decentralization process by helping mayors to better plan for the need of their communes. 3) Institutional strengthening will provide support to operational units and improved financing of priority services, such as solid waste management and secondary road maintenance. It will also finance community outreach programs related to waste management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Solid waste management","Percent":21},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"18,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Solid waste management"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"JB,BC,WB,BH,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Urban development","Public sector governance","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,26,72,73,84","mjthemecode":"11,9,9,2,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Solid waste management","code":"WB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":33},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":21},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20051229092206","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051229092206","DocDate":"16-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121322660","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121322660","DocDate":"19-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121322660","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121322660","DocURL":"19-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000333037_20130806140043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130806140043","DocDate":"24-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99040507275521","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99040507275521","DocDate":"24-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173654","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173654","DocDate":"15-APR-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
