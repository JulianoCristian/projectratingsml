The main objectives of the proposed project are to help improve the reliability of power production and supply throughout the country and the power sector's financial and operational performance; maximize the efficient use of locally available and economically accessible energy resources; and strengthen energy sector planning capability.  To this end, the project specifically entails two main components involving the energy sector as a whole and the power subsector in particular.  Within the latter component, the project involves generation rehabilitation and expansion; transmission and substation improvement; distribution rehabilitation and expansion and improvement in general plant and services.  In addition, this component includes power sector institution building; power sector studies; and an electric boiler program.  For the energy sector as a whole, the project entails providing equipment for production of pine charcoal and rice husk briquettes and technical assistance with sector studies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MG","sectorcode":"PY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","code":"PY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019115828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019115828","DocDate":"14-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120285353","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120285353","DocURL":"20-AUG-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120285554","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120285554","DocDate":"20-AUG-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120285353","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120285353","DocDate":"20-AUG-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120285554","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120285554","DocURL":"20-AUG-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e3689f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3689f_1_0","DocDate":"28-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e3689d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3689d_1_0","DocDate":"28-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926042802","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926042802","DocDate":"31-MAR-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Madagascar"}},"facets":{}}
