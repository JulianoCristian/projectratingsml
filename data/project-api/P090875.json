This one-tranche operation would be the second of a planned series of three annual PRSCs. The financial support provided through the PRSC-2 will further narrow the gap between the cost of implementing key elements of the GPRSP and resources, available from Government's own domestic revenues and other donor support. A policy dialogue and results-based framework under PRSC-2 will focus on the following pillars of the GPRSP: 1) promotion of good governance; 2) development of human capital in the areas of education and health; and, 3) improvement in the effectiveness and sustainability of the social protection system. In terms of benefits, the value added of the PRSC lies in both the nature of the instrument, and the results that are expected from improved functioning of national budget systems, from reduced transaction costs, and distortions due to international assistance, from better linkages between sectors and cross-cutting issues, from improved service delivery for the poor, and, from an improved wellbeing of the population. Notwithstanding, main risks associated include macroeconomic shocks that could undermine stability and growth, and, an accumulation of contingent liabilities and mandatory expenditure programs that could bring about fiscal slippages, and stall implementation of the more sensitive policy reforms, and possibly, delays in the Government implementation strategy."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cabo Verde!$!CV","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Projet de second cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-2)</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le deuxi\u00e8me Cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-2) continuera de soutenir la mise en \u0153uvre de la Strat\u00e9gie pour la croissance et la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (SCRP) du Cap-Vert.

Un dialogue sur l\u2019action \u00e0 mener et un cadre ax\u00e9 sur les r\u00e9sultats au titre du PRSC-2, se concentreront sur les piliers du DSCRP suivants : 1) la promotion d\u2019une bonne gouvernance ; 2) le d\u00e9veloppement du capital humain dans les secteurs de l'\u00e9ducation et de la sant\u00e9 ; et 3) l'am\u00e9lioration de l'efficacit\u00e9 et de la viabilit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de protection sociale.
