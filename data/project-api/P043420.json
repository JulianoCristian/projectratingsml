The project has four components: 1) financing the costs of goods and consultant services needed for day-to-day management of project implementation and the promotion and dissemination of project experiences; 2) financing technical assistance to support programs by the federal, state, or municipal governments aimed at institutional and regulatory reform of the water sector; further developing sector programs and data banks; developing and implementing a utility rating data base and a yardstick regulation system; environmental management programs; and studies and sector planning at the local level. This component also supports institutional reform programs. The third component finances unaccounted-for water control subprojects and other small but profitable operational, financial, and administrative actions in water utilities. It finances consultant services, goods, and works needed to support supply and installations; reviews and updates commercial cadastres and commercial, financial, accounting, and information systems; decentralizes operations and management; and funds marketing and communications."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of
