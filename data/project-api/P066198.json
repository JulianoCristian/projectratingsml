The two main components are: 1) The introduction of modernized payment mechanisms, the Real Time Cross Settlement (RTGS) system, with the associated real time cash management support functions of the Bank of Mauritius (BOM), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and commercial banks, to optimize liquidity without risking credit, or adverse monetary policy implications, while providing also support to the legal, and regulatory framework set-up for the RTGS system operation. In addition, cash management services to the MOF, and commercial banks will be introduced, settlement funds from bank reserves on deposit with the BOM will be ensured, and, a delivery versus payment settlement mechanism will be provided. Sub-components include provision of computer based application software systems, telecommunications equipment, and support during the implementation stages. 2) The component will identify the Government's risk priorities, and constraints on debt, and cash management, implement the development plan as identified, and, prioritize development activities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mauritius!$!MU","sector1":{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"International financial architecture","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"4,750,000","sector":[{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MU","sectorcode":"BC,FG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Rule of law","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"42,46,34,21","mjthemecode":"1,3,5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","code":"FG"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"International financial architecture","code":"46"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":70},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040108152143","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040108152143","DocDate":"31-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"005086501_2006071417242901","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005086501_2006071417242901","DocURL":"26-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00032105444420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00032105444420","DocDate":"14-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99092905334354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99092905334354","DocDate":"30-AUG-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mauritius"}},"facets":{}}
