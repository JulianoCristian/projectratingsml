The project components are as follows: a) Service delivery provides program support for provincial local government units (LGUs), which includes an expanded program of immunization package, an integrated management of child illness package, a micronutrient malnutrition prevention and control package, a parent effectiveness service package, and a Grade 1 Early Child Experience(ECE)/ECD package. This component will also finance facilities for municipal/city LGUs who wish to invest in upgrading of their ECD services. b) Support to service delivery will support the LGUs in implementing their investment packages in the areas of communications, planning, targeting, management information system, training, human resource development, and institutional development. c) Research and development (R&D) will finance R&D activities needed to support effective ECD program implementation, including initial piloting of new field-level technical interventions."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"19,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"BH,EC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"68,63,57,64","mjthemecode":"8,7,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":90},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060621110546","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060621110546","DocDate":"30-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123154709","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123154709","DocURL":"08-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123154608","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123154608","DocDate":"08-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123154306","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123154306","DocURL":"08-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123154407","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123154407","DocURL":"08-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123154709","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123154709","DocDate":"08-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123154306","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123154306","DocDate":"08-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123154407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123154407","DocDate":"08-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110746","DocDate":"27-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185615","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
