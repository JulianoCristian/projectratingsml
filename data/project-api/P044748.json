The proposed additional loan would be used to complete the rehabilitation of the original investment program for energy efficiency improvements in social sector buildings (schools and hospitals) across Belarus. Higher than estimated bid prices on the energy efficiency improvements due to the strong Euro and increases in wages in Belarus forced the implementing agencies to reduce the number of buildings covered in the original project. Additional energy efficiency retrofitting in about 140 buildings (schools and hospitals) across Belarus shall be implemented, including required consultants and support to the project management unit (PMU). The PMU has been funded from the government energy efficiency budget."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Belarus!$!BY","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"22,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Paper,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"BY","sectorcode":"BC,LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,71","mjthemecode":"9,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":94},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20111104023111","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20111104023111","DocDate":"19-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010111718111156","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010111718111156","DocDate":"17-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20100625023536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100625023536","DocDate":"31-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2008070113300113","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008070113300113","DocDate":"16-JAN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2008070113300113","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008070113300113","DocURL":"16-JAN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000310607_20071109085531","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20071109085531","DocDate":"05-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052009454972","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052009454972","DocDate":"26-SEP-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052009443859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052009443859","DocDate":"26-SEP-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200463730","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200463730","DocURL":"26-SEP-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200463528","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200463528","DocURL":"26-SEP-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052009465785","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052009465785","DocDate":"26-SEP-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01052204005269","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01052204005269","DocDate":"10-MAY-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Belarus"}},"facets":{}}
