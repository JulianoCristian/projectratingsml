The components of this project are: (1) river basin management, which includes the following activities: (i) strengthen national water resources management by reforming the regulatory framework to improve stakeholder participation in river basin management, strengthen the water rights concepts and management, increasing penalties and raising fees for water use, and improve information gathering and analytical capabilities at the national level; (ii) improve both the regulator capabilities and the information and resources monitoring capabilities at the basin offices in Rufiji and Pangani; and (iii) rehabilitate the hydrometric network in the Rufiji and Pangani basins; and (2) improvement of smallholder irrigation schemes in which the Government will assist in setting up farmer organizations, and provide financing for the improvement of infrastructure to be maintained and operated by water-user organizations."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of
