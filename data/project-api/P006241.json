The project to be financed by the proposed loan consists of the Marimbondo hydroelectric plant and approximately 1,400 km of 500 kv and other transmission lines connecting Marimbondo to Rio de Janeiro, plus the installation of two additional 150 Mw turbo-generator units at the existing Furnas hydroelectric plant. The cost per kw of the Marimbondo plant and transmission system is under $200, which can be considered very low-cost hydroelectric power, especially when taking into account the fact that part of the transmission system will serve other plants as well."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903170623","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903170623","DocDate":"31-MAY-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903331123","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903331123","DocDate":"31-MAY-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67f5a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67f5a_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAY-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67f59_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67f59_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAY-1970"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
