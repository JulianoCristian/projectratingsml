The project would comprise the following components: (i) periodic maintenance and minor improvements of highways; (ii) equipment and spare parts for highway maintenance, workshops, training, and pavement data collection; (iii) construction and/or rehabilitation of workshops and highway maintenance centers; (iv) technical assistance to Directorate General of Roads and Ministry of Communications; and (v) routine highway maintenance. While experience with the first project suggests that unavailability of sufficient numbers of trainees presents a risk to meeting planned targets, this would be offset by the commissioning of new workshops in the near future and increased efforts being made by the Government to make trainees available."},"country_namecode":"Sultanate of Oman!$!OM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"OM","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925062451","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925062451","DocDate":"17-OCT-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9772c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9772c_1_0","DocDate":"12-JAN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902384330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902384330","DocDate":"31-DEC-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912515939","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912515939","DocDate":"31-DEC-1981"}],"countryname":"Sultanate of Oman"}},"facets":{}}
