In order to achieve this objective the project will finance high priority investment, through coordinating efforts with other donor agencies, strengthening institutions and developing human capacity building measures. The project's design should enhance dialogue and create synergy among various social sector institutions and nongovernmental organizations. In health, the project will finance: (a) rehabilitation and equipping of health centers in three regions, and health posts, through community participation, throughout the country; (b) comprehensive support for in-service, local and short-term training programs for all levels of health workers and professionals; and (c) technical assistance and institutional strengthening inputs to coordinate and strengthen the delivery of information, education and communications (IEC) activities, develop an IEC policy framework, and suggest targeted programs. The project will be cross-sectoral, and support international and national nongovernmental organizations through the establishment of a Social Action Fund to help expand and/or develop social sector micro-projects throughout the country."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea-Bissau!$!GW","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"8,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GW","sectorcode":"JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"78,44,67,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":92},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01051604004380","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01051604004380","DocDate":"16-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121145810","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121145810","DocDate":"28-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121145810","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121145810","DocURL":"28-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1227d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1227d_1_0","DocDate":"23-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003164509","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003164509","DocDate":"29-JAN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003164324","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003164324","DocDate":"29-JAN-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea-Bissau","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
