The first of these changes refers to an extension of two MDTFs (TF097830 and TF097831). The second involves a reallocation of funds between Categories under two sources of IDA financing (H477-ET and H4578- ET). The closing dates for the project will be extended from December 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013. The proposed extensions are necessary to ensure that activities initiated under PBS 2 can be completed as the Project moves into its third phase. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has submitted an action plan for completion of project activities within the revised closing date of June 30, 2013.
