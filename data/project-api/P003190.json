The project provides for staff training, technical assistance, civil works, equipment and other facilities to strengthen existing institutions and infrastructure in support of adaptive and applied research programs and extension services.  It also supports reorganization of extension services in three of Zambia's nine provinces, and improvement in the linkages between research and extension services that are more responsive to smallholders' needs and constraints.  The project further aims to promote more efficient utilization of agricultural resources, better coordination of external assistance, and improvements in the institutional framework and manpower resources."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":15},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":85},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"13,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"77,78","mjthemecode":"10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":85}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36bdd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36bdd_1_0","DocDate":"09-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36bdc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36bdc_1_0","DocDate":"09-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095151","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095151","DocDate":"30-NOV-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia"}},"facets":{}}
