The project will have three major components: 1) priority social and income support programs; 2) pilot participatory social investment fund (FOPAR); and 3) improvement of social information, targeting and monitoring of social programs (SIEMPRO)."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":4},"sector5":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"152,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"TA,WZ,BC,EZ,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"51,55,57,54,65","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,6,7,6,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":50},{"Name":"Education","Percent":33},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":4},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00050605353262","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00050605353262","DocDate":"07-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200214897","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200214897","DocURL":"05-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200214897","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200214897","DocDate":"05-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb7f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb7f_1_0","DocDate":"21-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029221744","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029221744","DocDate":"27-OCT-1995"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
