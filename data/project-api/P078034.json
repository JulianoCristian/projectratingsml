The project appraisal document (PAD) states that a related objective is to build much-needed capacity for science-based management of coral reefs in developing countries, where the majority of reefs are found. The changes in this restructuring include a simplification and reordering of the key performance indicators as described in the project appraisal document (PAD) and the project implementation manual.
