Production increases would result partly from the development of nearly 20,000 acres of presently unused arable land, but to a more significant extent from the adoption by farmers of improved cultural practices of which the use of sprayers and insecticides for pest control are the most important. The necessary techniques would have to be demonstrated to the farmers by the extension services. The project would be complemented by an integrated package of infrastructural improvements (water supply, access roads, markets) and the provision of credit facilities. The purchase of sprayers and insecticides by farmers will be facilitated by a credit scheme, which will be administered by the Farmer Marketing Board (FMB). About one fourth of the proposed credit would be directed towards the financing of extension staff. Specific provision has been made for in-service training of local staff to replace gradually the non-Malawian extension staff needed initially."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"3,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e84f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e84f_1_0","DocDate":"05-FEB-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810190349258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190349258","DocDate":"31-JAN-1968"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
