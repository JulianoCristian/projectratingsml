The proposed line of credit would carry the following terms and conditions: (a) Onlending rate and exchange risk: DBZ would onlend at a minimum rate of 12 percent and review its interest structure annually with a view towards maintaining real positive interest rates; (b) Free limit: the free limit under the first line of credit to DBZ was US$250,000 (aggregate US$3 million). In recognition of the quality of DBZ' appraisals, the free limit will be raised to US$400,000 and the aggregate to US$5 million. This will still permit the Bank to review about 60 percent of projects financed by the Bank loan, which is considered adequate; (c) Amortization schedule: the proposed loan to DBZ would have a flexible amortization schedule conforming to the aggregate amortization schedule of DBZ sub-loans, none of which should, in principle, exceed 15 years; (d) Commitment fees: as a change from the first IBRD loan for which DBZ had concessionary treatment, standard commitment fees would be charged on the US$15 million Bank loan."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925062705","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925062705","DocDate":"13-SEP-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96bb7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96bb7_1_0","DocDate":"02-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e96bb6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96bb6_1_0","DocDate":"02-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902360389","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902360389","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912520448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912520448","DocDate":"31-OCT-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia"}},"facets":{}}
