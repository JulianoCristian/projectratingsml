This will be achieved by funding priority technical assistance that will provide government with the executive capacity required to implement its reform agenda. The implementation of the government's economic reforms will in turn expand the role of the private sector in the economy and put the country on the path of higher economic growth and faster poverty reduction. There are four project components. The first component strengthens the government's reform management capacity. The second component privatizes the People's Bank; provides technical assistance for the Asset Management Company; builds the capacity of the non-bank financial regulator; finances the establishment of the Pensions Reform Office, and supports private sector participation in the water sector; finds assistance to the Public Utilities Commission; and finances the regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector. The third component supports the design and implementation of a suitable mass communications strategy. The fourth component establishes and operates the Challenge Fund, which will manage a pool of technical assistance funds that can be flexibly allocated to sub-projects. This Fund will allow the relevant line ministries and government entities to respond flexibly to a dynamic and developing agenda."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"WC,BC,TZ,FZ,LZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,34,43,40,44","mjthemecode":"4,4,4,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":40},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":25},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080730054249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080730054249","DocDate":"01-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0309060408458","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0309060408458","DocDate":"31-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031214353128","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031214353128","DocDate":"29-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02112704014825","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02112704014825","DocDate":"02-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02072404015547","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02072404015547","DocDate":"15-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02071804241091","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071804241091","DocDate":"04-SEP-2002"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
