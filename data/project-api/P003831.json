In addition, 3,000 ha are to be cleared for smallholder houses, gardens and foodcrops. Through sugar development and technical assistance components, the project will contribute to reducing sugar imports by about 7%; provide the basis for improving technical and managerial approaches to rainfed sugarcane production which will influence GOI's overall sugar development program; and have a significant impact on the development of an area with limited agricultural alternatives. It will provide funds for start-up activities of future nucleus estates and smallholders projects based on annual crops; for studies in the sugar sector as well as contributing to the overall manpower and training program for new sugar estates."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"79,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925172213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925172213","DocDate":"17-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101343","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101343","DocDate":"31-AUG-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a1d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a1d_1_0","DocDate":"30-AUG-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901023669","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901023669","DocDate":"30-JUN-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
