The reform is based on three key elements: entry of world class operators, competition in all segments of the sector, and reorganization of the established public telecommunications service provider. The project has three components. The policy component entails: 1) reviewing and developing as appropriate the telecommunications legal and regulatory environment to ensure effective entry of private investors and operators in the telecommunications sector; 2) strengthening the capability of the Ministry of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications to manage regulatory issues including monitoring and evaluating operators' performance in the emerging multi-operator environment; 3) reviewing the management and allocation of radio frequency spectrum and 4) developing a plan for the provision of rural telephone services on a commercial basis. The investment component includes: 1) installation of local and inter-exchange networks to add one million telephone lines; 2) installation of a second fiber optic back-bone system; 3) installation of submarine optical fiber cable transmission systems; and 4) enhancement of information systems. The technical component will support: 1) strengthening the project implementation, marketing, customer services capacities; and 2) improving TELKOM's managerial capabilities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"325,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BC,CT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Urban development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,39,78,71,34","mjthemecode":"3,9,10,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0302040401101","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0302040401101","DocDate":"18-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042911333421","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042911333421","DocDate":"11-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040515054220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040515054220","DocDate":"11-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e1b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e1b_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e1a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e1a_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019102547","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019102547","DocDate":"18-MAY-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
