The Project comprises three main components.  (1) Improvements of the Quality of Basic Education would include: curriculum revision, the production and distribution of textbooks, in-service training programs for teachers and administrators, and improvements in physical infrastructure and facilities in the disadvantaged rural regions. (2) Strengthening of Sector Planning and Management specifically in the areas of personnel management, financial and budgetary control, and educational planning to meet the Government's decentralization policies. (3) Improvement in the Quality of Secondary Education could be accomplished by initiating an in-depth study of the present status and needs of secondary education, a two-phase pilot program of computer-assisted education, curriculum revision, and teacher/administrator training."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Costa Rica!$!CR","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":66},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":7},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"23,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CR","sectorcode":"ES,BC,BH,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Rural development","Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"71,78,65,59","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,8,10,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":66},{"Name":"Education","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Education","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02012504030442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02012504030442","DocDate":"03-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122482665","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122482665","DocURL":"09-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122482866","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122482866","DocURL":"09-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122482866","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122482866","DocDate":"09-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122482665","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122482665","DocDate":"09-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002020225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002020225","DocDate":"18-OCT-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Costa Rica","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
