Specifically, the project provides for expanding agricultural production through the strengthening and support of institutions and of technical infrastructure, integrated with improved extension, cooperatives, training, and social services. At full development, the project is expected to reach about 39,000 farm families (about 50% of the total in Borgou), and to generate an incremental production of some 10,400 tons of seed cotton, 5,000 tons of maize, 6,000 tons of sorghum, 1,200 tons of groundnuts, and 1,000 tons of cowpeas. The project's major quantifiable benefit will be increased production of cotton and foodcrops which, by the end of the implementation period, is expected to yield additional real income to participating farmers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000334955_20090123053647","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090123053647","DocDate":"01-MAR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04294_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04294_1_0","DocDate":"07-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04293_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04293_1_0","DocDate":"07-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902370721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902370721","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191251439","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191251439","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin"}},"facets":{}}
