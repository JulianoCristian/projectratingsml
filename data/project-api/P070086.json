The program forms part of a regional program for the Trade and Transport Facilitation in Southeast Europe Project, which aims to strengthen and modernize the customs administrations and other border control agencies in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Romania. The project consists of five components. 1) Customs Administration (CA) institutional reform will finance technical services to monitor CA's performance and to streamline operations. 2) Trade facilitation development will finance the provision of technical assistance and advisory services to trade and international transport participants through the Chamber of Commerce, and the improvement of cooperation between public and private parties using a virtual forum. 3) The third component will improve the Bulgaria Integrated Customs Information System (BICIS), a regional experience-sharing program. 4) This component will improve border crossing facilities at six border posts. 5) Program and project implementation will finance the services required to support the regional and national implementation of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"7,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"BG","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,29,28,47","mjthemecode":"5,2,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060404083212","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060404083212","DocDate":"30-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00062305373233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00062305373233","DocDate":"27-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201455988","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201455988","DocURL":"21-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00051605321682","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051605321682","DocDate":"03-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00031505333431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00031505333431","DocDate":"07-FEB-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Bulgaria"}},"facets":{}}
