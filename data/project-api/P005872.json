It seeks to increase the critically short supply of potable water, and meet the peak demand up to 1995, in Seiyun, PDRY's third largest town, and in thirty-nine surrounding villages in the eastern part of Wadi Hadramawt. It provides for the construction of a wellfield and the installation of water distribution networks in the Greater Seiyun area. The project also provides for the carrying out of water supply studies in Aden, the capital city of PDRY, for a second phase project and in other parts of the Wadi Hadramawt, and of sanitation studies in Seiyun. It includes management assistance and staff training of a PWC operating branch in the Wadi Hadramawt and the provision of operational equipment and facilities for the branch office. The project intends to provide substantial health and environmental benefits to the population in the Greater Seiyun area. It presents no special risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"7,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925165859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925165859","DocDate":"15-MAR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101628","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101628","DocDate":"30-NOV-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05dd5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05dd5_1_0","DocDate":"29-NOV-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05dd3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05dd3_1_0","DocDate":"29-NOV-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901020422","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901020422","DocDate":"31-OCT-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
