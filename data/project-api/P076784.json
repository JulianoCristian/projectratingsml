In the first instance, the Project aims to respond in the short-term to the critical problem of unemployment in the target rural areas through direct employment creation, using labor-intensive civil works for natural resource management emphasizing soil erosion control. The longer-term perspective emphasizes the instrument of asset creation for stimulating employment, mainly through natural resource management, protection of the environment, water resource mobilization, and income-generating rural development activities aiming at the substitution of perennial tree crops in place of annual cereal production, with the purpose of increasing labor productivity in a sustainable manner. There are five project components. The specific activities of Component 1, soil erosion control, comprise the following: reforestation targeting degraded mountainous areas, river bank protection entailing the biological stabilization of river banks; terracing and biological control entailing the building or the rehabilitation of terraces on steep slopes susceptible to serious erosion, plant material production, flood control structures, forest rehabilitation, and silvicultural activities, which aim at cleaning up degraded forest areas with plants that are old, dead or suffering from pests. Component 2 aims to diversify the production base by expanding the limited tree fruit production in the project area. Specific activities call for fruit tree plantations, windbreaks, vineyards, land clearing, upgrading and rehabilitating rural roads, commercial production of small livestock, and artisanal activities targeting rural women. Component 3 focuses on resource mobilization. Component 4 covers support for the Central project management unit (CCGW) and the Wilaya leve"},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"95,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"TA,AJ,AI,AT,AH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"85,57,83,78,76","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,10,11,7,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":45},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":35},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":5},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070719103415","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070719103415","DocDate":"27-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202195462","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202195462","DocDate":"30-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202195462","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202195462","DocURL":"30-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20060321093306","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060321093306","DocDate":"27-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03043004014980","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03043004014980","DocDate":"27-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0202150401085","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0202150401085","DocDate":"26-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02020104035175","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02020104035175","DocDate":"20-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02092404260748","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02092404260748","DocDate":"12-DEC-2002"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
