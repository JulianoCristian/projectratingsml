Additionally, the project aims to: (i) stimulate private sector response to the growing need for a variety of mining and environment related technical goods and services; and (ii) identify and adopt appropriate mechanisms to facilitate the development of small scale mines and to improve the social, health and environmental conditions of artisanal miners.  The project will comprise four main components: 1) regulatory and fiscal framework and training; 2) institutional strengthening and resources management; 3) environmental management; and 4) small scale and artisanal mining."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Mining and other extractive","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"21,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Mining and other extractive"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BF","sectorcode":"LB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,44","mjthemecode":"4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Mining and other extractive","code":"LB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":80},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050712120706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050712120706","DocDate":"28-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000160016_20030710175021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030710175021","DocDate":"13-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172102","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172102","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121422176","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121422176","DocURL":"28-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121421572","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121421572","DocURL":"28-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121421471","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121421471","DocURL":"28-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121421773","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121421773","DocURL":"28-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102301","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102301","DocDate":"29-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Burkina Faso"}},"facets":{}}
