It consists essentially of planting and bringing to maturity tea smallholdings and the provision of processing facilities. The processing part of the project, involving building and extending factories, is expected to be financed by CDC and commercial sources. The part of the project to be financed by IDA consists of the planting of some 35,000 acres of smallholder tea during the five-year period commencing with the fiscal year 1968/69 and bringing to maturity the most recent plantings financed under Credit 64-KE. It involves the supply and distribution by KTDA of planting material, the supervision of smallholder cultivation, training, and the collection, inspection and transportation of green leaf to processing factories. For these services, KTDA would collect cesses from smallholders."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"2,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e85e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e85e_1_0","DocDate":"17-JUN-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e85c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e85c_1_0","DocDate":"17-JUN-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903054090","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903054090","DocDate":"31-MAY-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903493527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903493527","DocDate":"31-MAY-1968"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
