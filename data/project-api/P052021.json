Project components will: 1) improve the quality of basic education, through enhanced teacher training in primary, and secondary schools in rural, and marginal urban communities. Textbooks, and instructional materials will be provided for targeted areas, and, poverty-based scholarships will be awarded annually at public schools, to include indigenous students. A pilot distance learning project (TELEBASICA), will focus on delivering secondary education, i.e., grades 7-9, to those students in remote areas, where schools are unavailable. Shanty school buildings will be replaced, to accommodate growing student enrollments in primary, and secondary schools; 2) expand the non-formal pre-school education program, through new community initial education centers (CEFACEIs), as well as home-based initial education program groups. Training will be provided to promoters in rural, and marginal urban areas; and, 3) strengthen the institutional capacity of the education system, by supporting decentralization at the regional, and school levels, providing training, and technical assistance to decentralized offices of the Ministry of Education, for the expansion of information, and assessment systems."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Panama!$!PA","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de Educaci\u00f3n B\u00e1sica (02)</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":54},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Paper,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PA","sectorcode":"BH,EC,EP,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"60,71,54,65,78","mjthemecode":"10,8,6,9,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":54},{"Name":"Education","Percent":32},{"Name":"Education","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20100719001430","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100719001430","DocDate":"16-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2008040111500209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008040111500209","DocDate":"26-OCT-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2008040111500209","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008040111500209","DocURL":"26-OCT-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000090341_20070717091036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20070717091036","DocDate":"06-JUL-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201535830","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201535830","DocURL":"24-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00082505335025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082505335025","DocDate":"10-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99090205411433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99090205411433","DocDate":"31-AUG-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Panama"}},"facets":{}}
