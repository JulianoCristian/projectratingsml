The project's development objective is to promote a more equitable and effective basic education system with community involvement in school governance. Specifically, this project increases coverage at the preschool and primary levels; improve quality and efficiency of preschool and primary school education, and promote continued institutional strengthening and modernization of the ministry of education, culture, and sports. There are three components. The first expands pre- and primary school coverage and funds a pilot scholarship program for poor students in the 4th-6th grades. The second component improves school quality by providing in-service teacher training; community preschool teacher incentives; learning materials; training for school principals and teachers; textbooks, classrooms, and a school library; rehabilitation and replacement of primary school infrastructure, including the support of a maintenance program and the provision of teacher housing in targeted areas; and performance based salary incentives to teachers and principals. The third component finances institutional strengthening and modernizes the education system by training school councils and principals in basic education, launching communications campaigns, setting up a national evaluation, and monitoring and evaluation.
