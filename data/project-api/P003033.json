The principal benefit of the Project would be institution building. Because of the experimental nature of the Project, no significant increase in agricultural production can be expected in the short run. However, if successful, the Project could lead to broad-based, comprehensive projects for agricultural and livestock development in Kwango-Kwilu. The institutional arrangements could be ultimately replicated in other agricultural development projects in Zaire."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of the Congo!$!ZR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"2,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ZR","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190237444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190237444","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e042cd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e042cd_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912484693","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912484693","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"}},"facets":{}}
