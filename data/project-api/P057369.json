The project is expected to allow the testing of a participatory and compregensive organizational change strategy to bring about change in court operations which ensure people swifter, fairer, and more transparent conflict resolution services. Beside the project management component, the project has two main and interrelated components. The first component supports a comprehensive organizational change process in 37 participating civil courts in the main urban centers of Colombia aimed at generating notable improvements in the expediency and quality in providing conflict resolution services and in the productivity of judicial resources. These sub-components address cultural change, human resource competencies and capabilities, organizational structure change, information systems, and court facilities. The second component supports a broad communication and participatory strategy by the SCJ aimed at ensuring public support and the involvement of relevant actors. The communication strategy consists of events, publications, and other means deemed necessary to promote the proposed change effort among judicial staff, media, relevant judicial actors, and public opinion at large."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Information technology","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Information technology"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"CA,BG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Rule of law","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,32,34","mjthemecode":"3,3,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Information technology","code":"CA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":90},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100805033534","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100805033534","DocDate":"30-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201561723","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201561723","DocURL":"04-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201561622","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201561622","DocURL":"04-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01120404004484","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01120404004484","DocDate":"08-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01112704104960","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01112704104960","DocDate":"06-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061710201845","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061710201845","DocDate":"03-NOV-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
