The project area would increase from two sub-districts of Wolamo under the first project to all seven sub-districts of Wolamo. Extension, animal health, soil conservation and home economics services together with credit for the purchase of agricultural inputs would be available to all farmers in the seven sub-districts of Wolamo. The project would introduce new services in the first project area, including livestock development, promotion of improved fodder crops and the establishment of a primary livestock market and holding ground. In both the first and second project areas, the project would make provision for continued support and expansion of cooperative marketing centers, construction of about 600 km of minor roads and tracks, improvement of rural water supplies and assistance to rural artisans.
