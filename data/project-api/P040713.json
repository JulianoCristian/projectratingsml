The project is composed of four components. The policy reform and institutional development component comprises five sub-components: 1) further deregulating the silk industry; restructuring the Bangladesh Sericulture Board (BSB) and its Research and Training Institute (BSRTI); 2) establishing the Silk Foundation (SF); 3) promoting associations of producers of cocoons and raw silk; and 4) providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Textiles (MOT). The productivity enhancement and research component consists of investments aimed at improving sector performance and enhancing technology. This component comprises sub-components to develop research capacity to improve yields, productivity, and income; to establish, staff, and operate germplasm maintenance centers; to develop and lease grainages (hatcheries); and to support a pilot program to determine the country's potential competitive advantage for producing high quality bivoltine raw silk. The third component, technology dissemination, develops the training capacity of BSRTI; sets up field training centers for chawki rearers, silkworm rearers, and reelers; funds the salaries of extension staff and provides technical assistance; and disseminates information about chawki rearing technology (which improves the quality of eggs and the rearing process). The fourth component, product development and market promotion, funds experts and training to produce fashion designs for trade shows, and finances project monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":1},"sector3":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":47},"sector4":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":22},"sector5":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"11,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Animal production"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"AJ,AB,YW,JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Rural development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,76,77,25,43","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,10,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":1},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":47},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":22},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000112742_20060719105225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060719105225","DocDate":"07-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040108105653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040108105653","DocDate":"23-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000178830_98101912213659","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912213659","DocDate":"29-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184013","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
