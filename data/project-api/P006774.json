The project would also assist in strengthening the institutional framework for planning, supervising, and evaluating future public investment in rural areas where there is a large concentration of small farmers, excluding the predominantly coffee growing regions."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"53,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e977e8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e977e8_1_0","DocDate":"08-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902400094","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902400094","DocDate":"31-MAY-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
