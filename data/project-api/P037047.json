This will help alleviate rural poverty and raise living standards of rural communities through increased access to basic social and economic and income-generating activities. The specific objectives are to: 1) reduce transport costs and raise the reliability of vehicular access to expand markets for agricultural and non-farm products; 2) integrate poorly accessible zones with regional economic centers; 3) improve transport conditions in rural villages; 4) generate employment through the rehabilitation and maintenance of rural roads to mitigate rural poverty; and 5) build up institutional capacity at local government levels and develop small and medium enterprises to manage and carry out, on a sustainable basis, the maintenance and upgroading of rural roads. The project consists of the following six components: 1) rehabilitation of rural roads; 2) rehabilitation of connecting primary and secondary roads; 3) routine maintenance of rural roads; 4) improvement of village streets; 5) improvement of non-motorized rural transport; and 6) institutional development which includes: a) technical assistance to improve planning and management of rural roads; b) studies on local road management practices and rural road financing; c) technical assistance to develop micro-enterprises formed by groups of beneficiaries for road maintenance; and d) technical assistance and training services to strengthen the local road construction industry."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Brief,Brief,Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"BC,BH,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Public sector governance","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"41,78,26,75,77","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,10,2,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150105114229","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150105114229","DocDate":"01-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150105115639","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150105115639","DocDate":"01-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150105121140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150105121140","DocDate":"01-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0108110400331","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0108110400331","DocDate":"25-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200220408","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200220408","DocURL":"07-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200220408","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200220408","DocDate":"07-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb8a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb8a_1_0","DocDate":"05-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019144814","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019144814","DocDate":"06-NOV-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
