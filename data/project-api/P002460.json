The Project would reduce transport costs on a major artery in south-central Somalia, the Afgoi-Baidoa road, which connects Mogadishu--principal port and capital city--with Baidoa, the administrative capital of the Bay Region which has a vast agricultural potential. It would also protect past capital investments by extending the road's service life.
