The operation will support the Ministry of Education (MOE) to: i) scale up community-based construction of primary schools and community grants for the schools; ii) provide teacher training for multi-grade teaching; and iii) build capacity in the Ministry of Education (MOE) to implement a sector program. The operation will support part of the financial gap required to be filled to enable Lao People's Democratic Republic to meet the Education for All (EFA) goals. The operation is part of a larger government led sector program called the Education Sector Development Framework (ESDF) that is expected to attract more financing from other development partners. The financing is expected to: i) increase primary education services through the construction of 1,120 additional classrooms serving about 270 communities in 19 high poverty districts; ii) train an additional 700 teachers who serve these communities; and iii) provide training in community management of resources to approximately 700 members of the additional Village Education Development Committees (VEDCs) to be incorporated into the program of support. The financing will also help generate capacity for the MOE to manage a sector program by strengthening the functions of program planning, budgeting, financial management, procurement and monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Lao People's Democratic Republic!$!LA","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":54},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
