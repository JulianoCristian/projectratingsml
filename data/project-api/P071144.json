The purpose of this level two restructuring is to: 1) extend the closing date of the project by 12 months, from June 30, 2013 to June 30, 2014; and 2) reallocate the remaining funds among disbursement categories. This 12 month extension is needed to complete two sets of activities of high corporate reputation risk and will be the final extension for the project. These include: the completion of the Management Action Plan (MAP) approved by the Board in May 2011 in response to an Inspection Panel request on behalf of ex-workers of the mining enterprise Gecamines, who took part in a project-supported labor retrenchment program in 2004-5; and the implementation of a critical phase of the National Payments System (NPS) at the Central Bank of Congo (BCC). This final extension of the closing date would allow the project to achieve an orderly closure with improved development objective impact, by completing the MAP and ensuring an uninterrupted purchase and installation of equipment for the modernization of the NPS. The reallocation is needed to redeploy funds made available upon completion or discontinuation of certain activities in favor of priorities agreed with Government, including the above activities."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of the Congo!$!ZR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Other social
