Part A of the project - support of social sector reform - aims at: (a) establishing and monitoring additional budgetary allocations to primary health care and education; (b) delineating and rationalizing the specific roles of non-governmental and governmental institutions in social services financing and delivery; and (c) providing an adequate framework and data base for larger investments in the social sectors.  Part B of the project - support of population, health and nutrition programs - aims at responding quickly to basic needs of population groups which are currently poorly served by health, family planning and nutrition services.  These programs include: (a) priority public health programs (health care strengthening and support to communicable disease control programs); (b) family planning and safe motherhood activities; and (c) nutrition activities, including iodine deficiency control."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of the Congo!$!ZR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":70},"theme1":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"30,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ZR","sectorcode":"JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,68,67,64","mjthemecode":"8,8,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":70}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214174516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214174516","DocDate":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120592145","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120592145","DocDate":"01-FEB-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120592145","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120592145","DocURL":"01-FEB-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36cff_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36cff_1_0","DocDate":"18-DEC-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929205552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929205552","DocDate":"29-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929205324","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929205324","DocDate":"15-NOV-1990"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"}},"facets":{}}
