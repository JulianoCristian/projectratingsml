The long-term objectives of this program are to increase agricultural productivity in an environmentally sustainable manner, to raise farmers' incomes, and to rationalize the use of public resources in support of agricultural services. The main components of the project are: (i) extension -- consolidating and improving agricultural extension services of the Ministry of Rural Development and the Environment (MDRE) and the National Agency for Rural Development of MDRE (SONADER) covering crop and livestock production and natural resource management; this will be done at the national level Research-Training-Extension Agency of MDRE in 9 of the 12 regions; (ii) training -- strengthening of the two agricultural training institutions; (iii) research -- strengthening the agricultural research system and improving the links with the extension services and the users; and (iv) support to the reorganization/decentralization of MDRE and policy support."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania!$!MR","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"18,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MR","sectorcode":"BC,AJ,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"86,26,78,82,77","mjthemecode":"10,11,10,2,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":35},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":35},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01072604031244","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072604031244","DocDate":"29-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121195921","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121195921","DocURL":"26-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121200022","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121200022","DocDate":"26-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121195921","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121195921","DocDate":"26-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121200022","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121200022","DocURL":"26-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005124651","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005124651","DocDate":"08-FEB-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005124354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005124354","DocDate":"07-FEB-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000356161_20100902024548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20100902024548","DocDate":"07-FEB-1994"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania"}},"facets":{}}
