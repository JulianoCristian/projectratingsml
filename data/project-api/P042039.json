The major modifications being proposed are: (a) dropping of the Tertiary Ports Component aimed at rehabilitating the ports of Angoche, Macuse, Mocimboa da Praia, and Pebane; (b) introducing a new component to support the rehabilitation of the jetties of Maputo, Catembe, Inhambane, Maxixe, Quelimane, and Recamba and the procurement of new ferries and other vessels for transport on water; (c) introducing a new sub-component to support the rehabilitation of the Ressano-Garcia line, a part of the Maputo railway system; (d) the reallocation among disbursement categories; and (e) the extension of the closing date by 13 months, from May 31, 2007 to June 30, 2008. The project's Results Framework has been refined accordingly, wherever affected by the above modifications. The proposed changes will have no implications on the original development objectives."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and
