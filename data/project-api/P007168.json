The project will finance two main components. The first component, basic services development, will improve the delivery of basic social services to the project area through: (a) a primary health care program consisting of family planning, maternal and child health care, and health and nutrition education, and safe motherhood referral program; and (b) pre-primary and primary school program including implementation of community operated schools, provision of teaching materials and textbooks, nutrition assistance and staff training. The second component, institutional development, aims to: (a) strengthen the Ministry of Health management and technical capacity to plan and deliver health services efficiently and improve cost-recovery systems; (b) increase the Ministry of Education's capacity in planning and management of services delivery; and (c) strengthen the Ministry of Planning's capacity to develop a social sectors information system, analyze social investment programs, and evaluate their impact."},"country_namecode":"Republic of El Salvador!$!SV","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":27},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":7},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":26},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"26,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"SV","sectorcode":"BC,EC,EP,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development","Human development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"55,63,65,69,67","mjthemecode":"8,8,8,8,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":27},{"Name":"Education","Percent":40},{"Name":"Education","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":26}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122445080","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122445080","DocURL":"11-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001044641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001044641","DocDate":"31-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001044425","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001044425","DocDate":"31-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052709444976","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052709444976","DocDate":"30-JAN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052709474414","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052709474414","DocDate":"30-JAN-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of El Salvador"}},"facets":{}}
