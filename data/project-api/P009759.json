Specifically it will help finance a five-year time slice of Gujarat's investment program for irrigation which will comprise: continuation of construction of three on-going major irrigation schemes and improving the village-to-market roads network in their command areas; modernization of parts of Gujarat's largest existing irrigation scheme (Ukai-Kakrapar) including reclamation of coastal lands; catchment protection and construction of irrigation facilities in the coastal areas of Saurashtra peninsula; operational and management improvements on existing and on-going irrigation projects; establishment of an institute for training of land development and water management specialists; and project monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the Second Gujarat Irrigation Project will include the preparation of future irrigation projects in India for possible Bank Group financing, including Narmada development projects. The project is designed to increase agricultural production and the standard of living of the farmers in Gujarat. The risks under the proposed project are those normally associated with irrigation projects in India."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"175,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925064622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925064622","DocDate":"28-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925182542","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925182542","DocDate":"17-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902350278","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902350278","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.2","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000094946_0001200541300","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0001200541300","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912485413","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912485413","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e041aa_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e041aa_1_0","DocDate":"29-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228cb0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228cb0_1_0","DocDate":"29-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
