The objectives of this project are twofold.  First, small-scale irrigation schemes will be established for the drought affected areas of Arsi, Bale, Northern Sidamo and Hararghe regions.  This part of the project will include the following: 1) strengthening the Ministry of Agriculture's Irrigation Development Department and irrigation departments in the project regions; 2) strengthening of agricultural support services; 3) establishing funds for construction or rehabilitation of irrigation schemes; and 4) providing credit to rural women for small income generating projects.  The second part of the project provides conservation and agricultural support in the Hararghe region.  The issues addressed are: 1) strengthening the Ministry of Agriculture's Community Forest and Soil Conservation Development Department; 2) providing agricultural support services in the Hararghe highlands for establishing conservation-based trials, bund stabilization, and improvements in the extension system; and 3) supporting a development program for rural women focussing on the introduction of vegetable gardens and nutrition education."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":21},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":18},"sector4":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":41},"theme1":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"7,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"AB,AZ,BC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,81,25,59,68","mjthemecode":"8,7,2,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":21},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":18},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":41}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36842_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36842_1_0","DocDate":"03-MAR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091731","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091731","DocDate":"28-FEB-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926032513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926032513","DocDate":"14-JAN-1987"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
