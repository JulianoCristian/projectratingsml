The project consists of the following components: 1) air, water and soil pollution control and land reclamation investments in CVRD's mining, industrial, rail and port operations; 2) natural resource investments, which include reforestation and the conservation of natural forest and ecosystems in or around CVRD's installations; and fauna and flora inventories and conservation; 3) socially oriented investments contributing to the alleviation of social problems in ecologically sensitive areas in CVRD's area of influence; 4) studies, research, training, and technical assistance, including a comprehensive impact assessment of the Tubarao industrial port, other pollution monitoring and impact studies; 5) implementation of a comprehensive corporate environmental information, control, monitoring and auditing system; and 6) other sub-projects and studies, aimed at further reducing pollution and environmental degradation."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of
