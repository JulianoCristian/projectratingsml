The five year project (FY1981-85) would: (i) improve and extend water supply and sewerage works initiated under the previous two projects, to further extend the supply hours and increase the number of persons served; (ii) upgrade and extend water supply systems in six additional towns; and (iii) provide institutional support to the WSSB. After completion of the project, about 97% of the population in the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara and 60% of the population in the additional towns would have access to 24-hour service of safe water. Consultant services would be provided to assist with complex design work, preparation of specifications and bidding documents as well as tender evaluation of major contracts and for general construction supervision. This technical assistance, support for the in-house training program and the prudent project implementation schedule reduce the risks of slow project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"27,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NP","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925050400","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925050400","DocDate":"29-SEP-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902360186","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902360186","DocDate":"31-JUL-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228cca_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228cca_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUL-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912493998","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912493998","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"}],"countryname":"Nepal"}},"facets":{}}
