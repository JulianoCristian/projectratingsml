To ensure sustained sector growth in the long run the project would also strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture's operational capabilities by providing training to field and technical staff and streamlining existing institutional arrangements in the project area. An estimated 60,000 farm families each cultivating about 2.1 ha farm on the average would directly benefit from the project. The project would include: improved extension services, credit and training for farmers; the construction of 65 farm service centers for the distribution of farm inputs, staff housing and project offices; expanding the Adidome Farm Institute, construction and improvement of access and feeder roads, strengthening of the Ministry of Agriculture's Regional office; and consultant services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"29,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925183334","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925183334","DocDate":"18-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902350075","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902350075","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e041a0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e041a0_1_0","DocDate":"22-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
