The project is divided into four main components: 1) metering, which includes the rehabilitation of the city gate meter stations, the installation/replacement of meters, and the purchase of meter proving equipment; 2) cathodic protection system rehabilitation; 3) analytical equipment including gas quality test equipment, leak detection equipment, and computer software and hardware to undertake network modeling; and 4) corporatization support involving assistance in project implementation, training of Azerigaz staff and upgrading of office equipment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Azerbaijan!$!AZ","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"20,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AZ","sectorcode":"LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39","mjthemecode":"4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000112742_20060719102848","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060719102848","DocDate":"26-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040415122547","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040415122547","DocDate":"09-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123425848","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123425848","DocURL":"02-OCT-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123430049","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123430049","DocURL":"02-OCT-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019185012","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019185012","DocDate":"02-AUG-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Azerbaijan"}},"facets":{}}
