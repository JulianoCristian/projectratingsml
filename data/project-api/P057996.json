There are four components to the project. The first component is the support for decentralized rural development. This component will support and strengthen the institutional, financial and human resource capacity of local government in the rural areas. It includes three clusters of activities. The second component is the Local Investment Fund (LIF). This component will be the mechanism for transferring financial resources to local governments to fund priority public infrastructure micro projects (health and maternity posts, schools, water supply and sanitation, culverts, etc.) identified in their Local Development Plans (LDPs) and Annual Investment Program (AlP). The third component is the community roads program. This component includes three clusters of activities. The first cluster will contribute to improved basic access in the 60 rural community (CR) targeted by the LIF. The second cluster will pilot mechanisms of community road management and maintenance as outlined in the Framework for the national rural transport strategy. The third cluster will assist the department of rural engineering of the ministry of agriculture to better define its mission and reinforce its capacity to assume responsibility for environmental aspects of the project. Finally, the fourth component is the project coordination, monitoring, and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":48},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"28,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"EZ,JB,WZ,TZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,57,51,78","mjthemecode":"10,6,7,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":48},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":12},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060725155530","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060725155530","DocDate":"29-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201110104","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201110104","DocURL":"23-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00040705411362","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00040705411362","DocDate":"31-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00011105452663","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00011105452663","DocDate":"20-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000333037_20090218010237","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090218010237","DocDate":"20-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99070105315950","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99070105315950","DocDate":"10-MAY-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
