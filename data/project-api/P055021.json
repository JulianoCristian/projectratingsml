The Cadastre system development component will help the Cadastre Agency to design and implement a unified national cadastre system including office renovations, archives creation, equipment, and technical assistance. The property registration system development component will support capacity building in the district courts and the Ministry of Justice for the implementation of the new real property based registration system. Third component, cadastre and property registration operations, will support mass registration and the joint conversion of parcels in the operation of the new property-based registration and cadastre systems, plus the creation of an effective data link. The component will support the construction and measurement of control points as part of a Geodetic network. The project management and development of a policy and legal framework component will provide partial support for the project implementation unit, training activities, and technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":11},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BG","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Rule of law"],"themecode":"36,34,40,25,83","mjthemecode":"11,2,4,3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100805015325","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100805015325","DocDate":"29-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20091016001246","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091016001246","DocDate":"31-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201483092","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201483092","DocURL":"05-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060604005222","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060604005222","DocDate":"25-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929102159","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929102159","DocDate":"18-APR-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Bulgaria"}},"facets":{}}
