In addition, it would assist the Government in the preparation of a national education plan to provide the basis for future development of the education system. Specifically, the five-year project would finance: (a) construction, furnishing and equipping of five new and the expansion of six existing secondary schools; (b) construction, furnishing and equipping of additional boarding and teaching facilities for Chancellor College at Zomba; and (c) preinvestment studies and technical assistance for preparation of a national education plan. As a result of the project, both enrollment and output of secondary and higher education would increase by about 5 percent per annum thereby providing much needed manpower for middle- and higher-level positions. Relatedly, the project would contribute to expanded educational and employment opportunities for women. It would also lead to improved analysis, planning and management of Malawi's education system. There are no major risks to the project except a possible shortage of secondary school teachers. Steps have been taken to minimize that risk."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"41,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925062119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925062119","DocDate":"27-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902364573","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902364573","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04287_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04287_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912515631","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912515631","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
