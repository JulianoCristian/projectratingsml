It includes the construction of a coal handling facility to supply coal to the new 1200MW power station for electricity generation now nearing completion at Sines.  The project consists of:  (i) a deep water berth within the shelter of a breakwater capable of receiving vessels up to about 150,000 DWT together with a coal stockyard and associated shore works.  The project further provides for; (ii) coal handling equipment including vessel unloaders, stacker/reclaimers and a conveyor system at the port.  Finally, it involves; (iii) studies relating to port development and management, detailed engineering and construction supervision, and training in port operations. The port is the least-cost solution for coal supply to the power plant under construction at Sines.  It has, furthermore, the potential for meeting expanded needs for a projected additional major coal-fired power plant."},"country_namecode":"Portuguese Republic!$!PT","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"66,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PT","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925213709","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925213709","DocDate":"07-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702140129","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702140129","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904162355","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904162355","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"}],"countryname":"Portuguese Republic"}},"facets":{}}
