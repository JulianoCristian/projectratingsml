The closing date for the project will be extended from June 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013, as per the request from the Minister of Education dated March 11, 2012. The project became effective on October 14, 2004, and the original closing date was June 30, 2007. The project closing date was extended twice before a first level restructuring took place in September 2010 (which included the third closing date extension to June 30 2012 and added a new component to build 20 six-classroom block additions). The project development objective was revised during the September 2010 restructuring as follows: to improve the conditions of learning of students in primary and secondary schools through the construction of new schools, the extension of existing schools, and the rehabilitation of schools in need of urgent repair. To date, the project has completed the rehabilitation of all targeted 133 schools. For the construction of new schools and extensions of existing schools, all bidding and contract award activities have been completed, including resolving all suspended construction contracts. Construction is well underway as follows: (i) new schools: a total of 37 new schools have been completed, and the construction work at the remaining 13 sites is progressing well; (ii) six-classroom blocks: all contracts for the 21 six-classroom additions (one more than the target of 20) have been signed and construction is underway. With the exception of about US$2 million in contingency funds, all project funds have been committed and disbursement has reached 75 percent of"},"country_namecode":"Republic of
