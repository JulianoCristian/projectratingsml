Furthermore, by acting now to revitalize and expand the tuberculosis control program, Sri Lanka can help reduce the risk of an emerging HIV-associated TB epidemic among the HIV-infected and the non-infected. There are three project components. The first component expands prevention programs for highly vulnerable groups and the general population, in particular youth. The second component develops programs to sustain political and societal commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention and to reduce stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS and expands coverage and quality of treatment services and develops research. The third component strengthens multisectoral involvement and capacity, improves the information base for policy decisions and program management, and improves health care waste management. The project will also support efforts to reduce the risk of an emerging HIV-associated TB epidemic among the HIV infected and the non-infected populations.
