The North Road has been given the highest priority both in the National and Central American regional highway investment program. One-third of Honduras' total population live in its zone of influence, where the main cities and most of the country's manufacturing and processing facilities are located, as well as about one quarter of the country's total farm area. The North Road will replace a narrow winding gravel road. Assuming a reasonable annual rate of increase in road traffic, the design of the road would ensure adequate capacity to accommodate future traffic subject to certain relatively minor improvements of the pavement to be made in due course."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901205345","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901205345","DocDate":"20-FEB-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67876_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67876_1_0","DocDate":"02-FEB-1965"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902480082","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902480082","DocDate":"31-JAN-1965"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903480851","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903480851","DocDate":"31-JAN-1965"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras"}},"facets":{}}
