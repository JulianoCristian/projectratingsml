The primary objective is to accelerate the substitution of exportable petroleum product fuels with nonexportable natural gas.  This would be achieved through : a) provision of an assured supply of natural gas to power plants, manufacturing industries and commercial entities in Surabaya, and 12 other towns in its vicinity in East Java and in Medan in North Sumatra; b) the integration of gas utilization plans and operations to facilitate balanced development; and c) institution building, technology transfer, and marketing studies to accelerate safe and efficient use of natural gas and to help plan its long-term development.  The project consists of the following components : 1) design and construction of a natural gas supply system for Surabaya and its environs and expansion of the natural gas supply system for Medan; 2) technical assistance involving enhancement of PGN's skills in growth management, establishment of a Gas Technology Development Unit in LEMIGAS and upgrading of skills in MIGAS to facilitate institution of a regulatory system for safe use of natural gas; and 3) feasibility studies for natural gas marketing in Palembang, Jambi, Batam Island and Balikpapan."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":79},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":21},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"86,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BC,LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Trade and integration","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,33,48,84","mjthemecode":"11,5,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":79},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":21}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040514442745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040514442745","DocDate":"06-JUL-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042911300746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042911300746","DocDate":"06-JUL-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928090451","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928090451","DocDate":"08-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928090314","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928090314","DocDate":"08-MAY-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
