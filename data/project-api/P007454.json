With this in mind, the project comprises (a) physical rehabilitation and managerial and technical assistance for the two main public sector factories and estates; (b) rehabilitation of the irrigation infrastructure for cane cultivation in the dry Southern Central Plains region; and (c) sugar research activities. The project will create stability in an industry whose foreign exchange earnings are vital to the country's balance of payments, and safeguard the incomes of over 45,000 workers and farmers who depend on the industry."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":76},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":4},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"34,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"JM","sectorcode":"BC,AB,AI,YB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"45,79,75","mjthemecode":"10,10,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":76},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":4},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170814","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170814","DocDate":"30-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171421","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171421","DocDate":"31-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171209","DocDate":"31-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Jamaica"}},"facets":{}}
