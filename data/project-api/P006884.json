Specific project objectives are to: (i) develop the financial markets into a more efficient channel for mobilizing domestic savings and financing investment; (ii) improve the institutional capacities for financial sector policy formulation and strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework in order to, inter alia, minimize the risk of loss of confidence in the financial markets; (iii) contribute to increase the supply of securities, by inter alia facilitating the introduction of new financial instruments; (iv) consolidate the implementation of the social security reform; (v) contribute to deter corrupt or fraudulent practices such as money laundering; and (vi) contribute to more efficient operation of financial and non-financial markets by promoting competition and deterring anti-competitive practices in those markets.  The components of the project are as follows: 1) developing the financial markets into a more efficient intermediation channel; 2) strengthening regulation and supervision capacity in the financial sector; 3) increasing the supply of securities and the availability of other financial instruments; 4) consolidating the implementation of the new social security system; 5) developing a system for control of corrupt and fraudulent practices; 6) developing competition and anti-trust policy capacity; and 7) project management and administration."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"Capital markets"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Technical Annex,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"FK,BE,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,34,29,40,42","mjthemecode":"4,4,2,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":55},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000310607_20070810111534","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070810111534","DocDate":"26-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040630093134","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040630093134","DocDate":"20-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172517","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172517","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123142852","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123142852","DocDate":"29-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123143053","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123143053","DocURL":"29-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123142852","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123142852","DocURL":"29-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123143053","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123143053","DocDate":"29-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102821","DocDate":"28-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052410193326","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052410193326","DocDate":"06-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
