The extension is necessary to allow Serbia to use approximately US$ 840,000 in uncommitted funds, which arose in part due to an exchange rate buffer that implementing agency has retained. These funds would support additional public awareness raising activities and nutrient management investments in about six farms. These activities have high priority and are fully consistent with the original project objectives and economically justified. The mission positively appraised the implementing agency's action plan to implement these activities. This will be the second and final extension of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Serbia!$!YF","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry
