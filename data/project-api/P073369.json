The project has the following components. Component A: Community Development & Infrastructure Building. This component consists of the following three sub-components : (i) Community Development; (ii) Community Infrastructure; and (iii) Tribal Development Program. This component will consist of the following sub-components. A1: Community Development. A2: Community Infrastructure. A3: Tribal Development Program. Component B: Institutional strengthening. This component consists of the following four sub-components: (i) Capacity building; (ii) IEC including Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion (SHP); (iii) Monitoring and Learning; and (iv) Project Management.  B1: Capacity building. B2: IEC including sanitation, and hygiene promotion. B3: Monitoring and Learning. B4: Project Management. C: Sector Development and Strengthening. C1: Knowledge Management for Policy Support. C2: Water Quality Monitoring. Component D: Pilot Component. Piloting New Initiatives: The project will support implementation of three pilots, which seem fundamental to improve decentralization and governance of district and village-level institutions; to introduce aquifer-based supply and demand management of water to enhance sustainability of water sources with reference to communities' broad-based priorities for diverse usages of water; and to develop and scale up a model for O&M of water supply facilities that would expand beyond the proposed project. D1: Local Government Incentive Fund. D2: Groundwater Aquifer Management Pilot. D3: O&M Pilot Fund."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"181,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Indigenous Peoples Plan,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"JB,WA,WC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"70,60,57,26,78","mjthemecode":"10,2,7,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":40},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000445729_20130712115815","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130712115815","DocDate":"27-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20100921010446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20100921010446","DocDate":"28-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20030801110611","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030801110611","DocDate":"17-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000094946_03052004071312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052004071312","DocDate":"15-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03052104055447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052104055447","DocDate":"15-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03052104055448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052104055448","DocDate":"15-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02112804182640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02112804182640","DocDate":"13-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02112104094084","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02112104094084","DocDate":"05-NOV-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
