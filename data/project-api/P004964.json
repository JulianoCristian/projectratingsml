Project objectives are to:  (a) strengthen the institutions that implement the cadastre; (b) support an increase of annual land registration over four years; and (c) develop cadastre-based information systems for taxation and other land-related uses.  The project includes three components: (a) a four-year cadastral mapping program for 3 million ha of rural land and 36,000 ha of urban land, during which mapping techniques will be tested, and computerized land registration and map production will be introduced; (b) strengthening of the National Cadastre Agency; and (c) provision of project-related technical assistance, training, and studies."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law","Rule of law","Rural development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,75,36,34,83","mjthemecode":"11,3,3,10,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01062704241343","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01062704241343","DocDate":"06-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122520163","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122520163","DocURL":"05-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122520163","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122520163","DocDate":"05-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002084357","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002084357","DocDate":"31-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002084524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002084524","DocDate":"21-MAY-1992"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
