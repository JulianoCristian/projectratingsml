It would consist of strengthening about 520 km of federal roads, and carrying out economic and engineering studies of a major North-South road and a survey to establish improvement priorities for the federal trunk road network. Consultants would be engaged to continue and expand a program for the training of road maintenance technicians, and experts recruited to fill critical positions in the Federal Ministry of Works. The project would also assist in constructing 14 staff housing units, and in providing road safety and pavement testing equipment. There are no unusual risks for this type of project."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"108,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925043744","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925043744","DocDate":"17-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902354963","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902354963","DocDate":"30-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191248503","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191248503","DocDate":"30-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e976c0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976c0_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1980"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
