These measures should reduce, and eventually eliminate, FA's financial dependency on the Government. The project comprises a number of subprojects which are expected to begin in 1979 and 1980, as follows: (a) rehabilitation of track, bridges and communications, and partial track renewal of main lines; (b) purchase of line and shunting locomotives, passenger coaches and specialized wagons; (c) rehabilitation of wagons, purchase of spare parts for wagons and locomotives, and modification of existing box cars; (d) technical assistance and studies. Benefits arise from cost reductions because of improved equipment and facilities and from the railways carrying traffic which otherwise would have been moved by road at a higher cost to the economy. Unquantified benefits include the advantages of more reliable and faster service to shippers and passengers. The project faces no special risks."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"96,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924212006","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924212006","DocDate":"31-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924211923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924211923","DocDate":"26-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902323269","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902323269","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912411554","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912411554","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e45c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e45c_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e45b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e45b_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1979"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
