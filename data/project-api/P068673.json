The components will: 1) finance rehabilitation, and improvements of the Managua - Izapa, and the Muhan - El Rama roads. Rehabilitation will be within the existing right of way, and will encompass bus pullover areas, and road shoulders to improve traffic safety, in addition to pavement recycling techniques to finalize road sections of the Managua-Izapa road, already improved under a previous operation, as well as the Muhan-El Rama road, including existing alignments, drainage, and road signaling works; 2) stabilize rural secondary, and tertiary roads, primarily within the region devastated by Hurricane Mitch, under private contractors, who will restore roads to gravel standards. Consulting services will assist the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI) during implementation; 3) finance routine, and periodic maintenance, to implement spot maintenance, and major maintenance works by contracts, to increase private participation, including training, equipment, and technical assistance (TA) for micro-enterprises; and, 4) help MTI implement, and manage road sector development through TA, training, and studies provision."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Nicaragua!$!NI","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Tercer Proyecto de Rehabilitaci\u00f3n y Mantenimiento de Carreteras </ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"75,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"NI","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"47,78","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080402013728","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080402013728","DocDate":"20-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201182919","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201182919","DocURL":"07-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201182718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201182718","DocDate":"07-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201182617","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201182617","DocURL":"07-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201182718","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201182718","DocURL":"07-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201182919","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201182919","DocDate":"07-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201182617","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201182617","DocDate":"07-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01013105315240","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01013105315240","DocDate":"18-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00121301592046","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121301592046","DocDate":"30-NOV-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Nicaragua","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
