The project will, over a five year period, aim at: (a) raising yields and reducing costs of production of jute on one million acres by improved extension activities and credit; (b) establishing a pilot jute marketing scheme aimed at increasing farmers' returns; and (c) improving production and marketing equipment (seed drills, hand hoes, storage sheds, baling equipment, etc.). In addition, technical assistance will be provided through consultants; the project will include overseas training of staff, local training of selected farmers and project evaluation services. Improved marketing practices, in particular through the pilot marketing scheme and ultimately through the establishment of intelligence and price management mechanisms, will contribute to stabilizing the supply of jute fiber and goods around a level adequate to meet the requirements of local jute mills and for export at competitive prices."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"21,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095256","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095256","DocDate":"28-JUN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081df569e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081df569e_1_0","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b88_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b88_1_0","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902293856","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902293856","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191206584","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191206584","DocDate":"31-DEC-1977"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
