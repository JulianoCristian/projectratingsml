Most of these changes are part of second-phase reforms in the Costa Rican Social Security Institute (Caja Costarricanse de Seguro Social, or CCSS). There are two project components. The first provides financing to develop the strategies and instruments required to achieve the objectives set forth in the Policy Activity Schedule (PAS) (Annex 2A). The component will be executed through two mechanisms that 1) finance local and foreign consultant services, information systems, the development of supply chain solutions--including e-procurement, equipment for the Basic Health Care Teams (EBAIS), training in health policy, clinical practice and management, and study tours to incorporate international \"best practice\" into the Costa Rican health sector; and 2) allocations to decentralized sub-projects with the hospitals and health areas. The second component supports the development of a monitoring and evaluation system, and includes resources to establish and sustain information, education, and communication campaigns related to the modernization process. Support will also be given for the day-to-day operations of the Project Coordinating Unit assisting in project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Costa Rica!$!CR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de Fortalecimiento y Modernizaci\u00f3n del Sector Salud II</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"17,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CR","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"26,67,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20100820011518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20100820011518","DocDate":"25-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02020104015064","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02020104015064","DocDate":"24-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01062704152241","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01062704152241","DocDate":"22-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01072006081758","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072006081758","DocDate":"13-JUN-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Costa Rica","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
