The main objective of the first phase (1995-2000) is to lower the illiteracy rate to about 40 percent overall, and to 47 percent for women, by supporting literacy providers to offer programs to a total of about 300,000 beneficiaries, 75 percent women. Other objectives include: 1) ensuring the sustainability of literacy skills; and 2) strengthening the capacity of the private sector to deliver effective programs, and the capacity of the public sector to monitor, evaluate and coordinate public investments in literacy programs. The project will consist of the following components: 1) literacy and post-literacy sub-projects, including: (a) a minimum of 250-300 hours of instruction which is necessary to attain a level of literacy (fourth grade equivalent) where skills are actually acquired and, therefore, can be maintained; (b) meaningful content for adult learners; (c) materials appropriate for adults; (d) teachers knowledgeable about the content and trained in adult education approaches; (e) regular in-service teacher support; and (f) participation of beneficiaries in program design and implementation; and 2) project management and capacity building in program delivery, management, and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":81},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":19},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"12,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"BC,EL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"59,61,65,44","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":81},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040625094229","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040625094229","DocDate":"19-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123403859","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123403859","DocURL":"17-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123403859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123403859","DocDate":"17-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123403557","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123403557","DocURL":"17-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123403758","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123403758","DocURL":"17-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123403758","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123403758","DocDate":"17-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123403557","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123403557","DocDate":"17-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019210416","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019210416","DocDate":"09-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000386194_20120903060823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120903060823","DocDate":"09-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
