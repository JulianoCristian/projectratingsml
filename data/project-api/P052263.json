The project includes four components. 1) The first component will finance small socio-economic infrastructure, through the rehabilitation and extension of elementary schools and health centers, to include installation of water points and/or construction of latrines, etc. Repair of bridges, and community public centers, such as markets, will also be considered under this component. 2) The second component focuses on capacity building, financing human capital investments for community benefits, thus increasing functional literacy and providing training for village health workers. It will also provide beneficiaries with organizational , managerial and strategic skills. 3) The third component will support financial intermediation. Although the definition of this component will become effective as the project progresses, institutional building will promote income-generating activities. 4) The fourth component will promote institutional mechanisms for a system of decentralized social funds, where project management and institutional building will have control over operational expenditures concerning implementation, supervision and coordination."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Togo!$!TG","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":64},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"TG","sectorcode":"TA,JA,JB,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"51,78,56,57,59","mjthemecode":"7,7,6,10,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":64},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":8},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030708155419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030708155419","DocDate":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9908190532032","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9908190532032","DocDate":"26-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201050545","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201050545","DocURL":"03-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201050444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201050444","DocDate":"03-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201050545","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201050545","DocDate":"03-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201050444","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201050444","DocURL":"03-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201050343","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201050343","DocURL":"03-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201050343","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201050343","DocDate":"03-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99051205333145","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99051205333145","DocDate":"14-APR-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Togo"}},"facets":{}}
