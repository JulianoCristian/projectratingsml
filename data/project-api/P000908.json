It will comprise institutional development, investment, and sector planning components. Institutional development will focus on the commercialization of the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG) through (a) completion of the management reorganization; (b) financial restructuring; (c) a performance contract with the government to improve ECG's efficiency as a power utility; (d) a manpower reduction, staff development and training program; and (e) a program of technical assistance from a mature power utility. The investment component will consist of ECG's total capital expenditure through 1992, comprising subtransmission, distribution and telecommunications equipment, tools and materials, vehicles, and staff housing.
