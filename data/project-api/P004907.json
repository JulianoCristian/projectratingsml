The project will finance road rehabilitation works by strengthening high-traffic basic economic network pavements; rehabilitating medium-traffic national roads with appropriate low-cost technologies; rehabilitating priority bridges; and related design and supervision. The project will also finance road maintenance through periodic maintenance by contract for national roads; purchasing of equipment for current and emergency maintenance of Saharan tracks and for traffic counting; providing technical assistance for and executing a pilot program for maintenance of municipal roads; and related supervision, general studies and training."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":71},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":29},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"130,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,40,39,78","mjthemecode":"10,4,4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":71},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":29}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030703101606","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030703101606","DocDate":"27-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040729133240","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040729133240","DocDate":"12-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123064055","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123064055","DocURL":"07-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123064055","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123064055","DocDate":"07-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3db0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3db0_1_0","DocDate":"31-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007004525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007004525","DocDate":"06-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000386194_20111117015702","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20111117015702","DocDate":"06-JAN-1995"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
