The project comprises two major components: (i) the institutional strengthening window; and (ii) the priority water and sewerage investments window. The institutional strengthening window includes: RWCs capacity building through in-country training and provision of technical assistance; carrying out a study of options for improved management of water resources; strengthening and providing technical assistance to the Project Management Unit that has been set up by the Ministry of Regional Development and Construction; and enhancing RWCs investment planning capability and construction supervision. The priority water and sewerage investments window includes, in-turn, two components: the completion and rehabilitation window and the non-revenue water reduction window. The project completion/rehabilitation window will fund completion of ongoing investments that have high rates of return, and rehabilitation and upgrading of facilities. The non-revenue water reduction window will respond to the emerging incentives for water companies to reduce water losses and to improve their operating efficiency."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"57,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sewerage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BG","sectorcode":"WS,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,71,43","mjthemecode":"4,9,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":75},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20050422101132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050422101132","DocDate":"07-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030701101329","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030701101329","DocDate":"27-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200140995","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200140995","DocURL":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200140995","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200140995","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200140794","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200140794","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200140794","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200140794","DocURL":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200141196","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200141196","DocURL":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99c58_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99c58_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005070638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005070638","DocDate":"05-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005070911","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005070911","DocDate":"05-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Bulgaria"}},"facets":{}}
