The first project components -- improving school quality and system efficiency -- will provide teacher development and school cluster based training; improve curriculum; and strengthen national institutions to ensure quality primary education and teacher training.  The second component -- strengthening institutional capacity and management -- will be done at central, district, thana, and school levels.  Activities will focus on strengthening management skills and improving information systems.  The third component -- increasing equitable access -- will include construction of new schools and additional classrooms in under-served areas for hard-to-reach children; block grants to schools to support the provision of stationery to the poorest students; and social mobilization."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":82},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":9},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":3},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"BH,JB,BC,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,78,65,59,71","mjthemecode":"9,7,8,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":82},{"Name":"Education","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":3},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040625161221","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040625161221","DocDate":"23-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200485322","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200485322","DocURL":"30-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062811061929","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062811061929","DocDate":"13-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110757","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110757","DocDate":"05-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183334","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183334","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
