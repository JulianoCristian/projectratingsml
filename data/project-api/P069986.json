Project components include: 1) financing of community development micro-projects, providing grants to local government units (LGUs), and farmer cooperatives. These micro-projects will be prepared by local officials in consultation with residents, and implemented in accordance with project procedures, i.e., using local contractors, suppliers, and laborers. Each micro-project will include civil works for construction, extension or rehabilitation of water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, health clinics, additions to primary and secondary schools, as well as community markets, feeder roads, irrigation networks, and essential furniture and goods. Resources will be available for training and technical services to improve planning, consultation, and management capacity of communities; 2) financing of multipurpose, community tele-centers, through grants provided to LGUs, so as to extend, or reconfigure facilities to accommodate information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastructure, provide computers, software, furniture and equipment, and set Internet services, supported by specialized services; and, 3) project management costs, to finance incremental operating costs, equipment, and studies."},"country_namecode":"West
