This will be achieved by the development and phased implementation of a strategy to diversify employment services.  It will improve absorption of unemployed, unskilled workers in productive employment by:  (a) generalizing the pilot program of job-insertion training developed by the Turkish Employment Agency; and (b) strengthening public employment services, including the introduction of employment counseling for job seekers and screening of job seekers, the modernization of job placement practices, and improved management of employment services.  It will improve efficiency of labor-market decisions by: (1) developing and introducing career counseling services in labor office and secondary schools; (2) developing and adopting employer-relevant occupational standards and certification; and (3) producing and disseminating information from various sources on labor-market trends. Finally, the project will promote women's productive employment by:  (a) deliberate actions to meet the needs of women's employment under the other project activities; and (b) conduct of research and dissemination of research findings on how to alleviate the constraints on women's employment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"67,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"59,51,55","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01072804135087","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072804135087","DocDate":"27-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200100336","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200100336","DocURL":"01-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200100537","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200100537","DocURL":"01-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200100537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200100537","DocDate":"01-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200100336","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200100336","DocDate":"01-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002071919","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002071919","DocDate":"06-NOV-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
