Brazil has witnessed enormous progress in all economic and social fronts, the exception being the critical situation of the shelter for the poor. The Government is committed to address this challenge by supporting the needs of the very poor, and the development of a market that could, and should cater to the less poor. This loan focuses on one key component: housing sector reform. It thus deepens the reform agenda to promote efficiency of the financial sector and improve economic opportunity. Specifically, the project will a) develop a sound national policy, and institutional framework for housing and urban development; b) strengthen the housing credit, and savings systems, and provide incentives for the housing finance market to expand, as well as move \"down-market\"; c) design and implement a unified federal housing subsidy system, to address the affordability of housing solutions for the poor; and, d) reduce the costs of formal, urban land development, by strengthening land legislation, regulations, and real property registries. In spite of several risks to this operation, namely, timing and expectations, coordination and institutional risks, and, macroeconomic developments and interest rate volatility, the Government's commitment to pursue its fiscal adjustment policy, should lead to a decline in overall debt and lower market interest rates. Furthermore, the program provides a conceptual framework to help the Government monitor the segments of the housing market, including those relevant for poor and middle-income families."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Housing finance","Percent":47},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":16},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":33},"theme5":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"502,520,000","sector":[{"Name":"Housing finance"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Housing construction"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"YC,BZ,JB,FC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Rule of law"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"34,71,44,54,83","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,6,4,9,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Housing finance","code":"FC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":47},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":23},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100804014525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100804014525","DocDate":"30-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090810001525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090810001525","DocDate":"29-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"006768901_2006070514042201","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006768901_2006070514042201","DocURL":"11-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"006768901_2006070514042201","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006768901_2006070514042201","DocDate":"11-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050525094700","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050525094700","DocDate":"11-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050324164351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050324164351","DocDate":"24-MAR-2005"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
