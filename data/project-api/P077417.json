In addition, a secondary objective is to support some basic steps towards laying the foundation for a transparent, well-functioning public administration. The Grant will finance the employment by AIA of qualified firms to work with AIA officials to carry out, on an interim basis, government procurement, financial management and audit functions on behalf of the AIA; develop the administration's capacity; and assess existing systems and procedures to recommend suitable policy reforms. Services will also be provided to enhance aid coordination, strengthen payroll management and budget processes, and develop capacity in economic policy formulation. In addition, resources are available to fund studies and institution building within selected entities of the AIA."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AF","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,27,29","mjthemecode":"2,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060330083622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060330083622","DocDate":"27-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031116260091","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031116260091","DocDate":"09-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_02032004025020","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02032004025020","DocDate":"12-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02031404044332","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02031404044332","DocDate":"11-MAR-2002"}],"countryname":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan"}},"facets":{}}
