It would develop the transit traffic which constitutes one of Benin's most important economic activities by removing one of the major bottlenecks on the Cotonou-Niger and Cotonou-Nigeria axes. The project risk are linked to Benin's undertaking an investment which would also serve Niger and Nigeria without a formal commitment by these two countries to the project. However, the competitive advantages of Cotonou are strong enough to assure that both Niger and Nigeria will continue using it."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfcfbc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfcfbc_1_0","DocDate":"08-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c12_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c12_1_0","DocDate":"08-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c11_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c11_1_0","DocDate":"08-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902303965","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902303965","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912390790","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912390790","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin"}},"facets":{}}
