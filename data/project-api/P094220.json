This restructuring paper seeks approval to extend the project's closing date of July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013.  This represents a cumulative extension of 12 months from the original closing date of December 31, 2012.  The proposed six-month extension will allow: (i) finalizing the construction of two primary health care facilities in the Sheki and Gakh regions; (ii) implementing necessary corrections to village hospitals in the Sheki and Gakh regions, including ensuring proper ventilation, adding rails to stairways, and installing adequate heating systems; and (ii) finalizing the installation of waste water management facilities for the Sheki and Agdash hospitals that were constructed under the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
