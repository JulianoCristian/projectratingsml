Project will provide a line of credit to TDFL to finance its projected lending to medium scale industrial enterprises and related services, agro-processing and tourism development projects through December 1981. The project aims to further improve and enhance the role of financial intermediaries in resource allocation in First Tanzania, and to contribute to the foreign exchange resources available to medium size investment in the sectors involved. There are no major institutional risks associated with this project as TDFL is a fairly well established financing institution. However the industrial sector, the primary beneficiary of TDFL financing, faces a number of serious operating problems which could affect TDFL's ability to expand as projected in this report."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902333295","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902333295","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e963_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e963_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e962_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e962_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1979"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
