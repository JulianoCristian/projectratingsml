Connectivity will unleash the growth potential across various economic corridors, connect lagging regions with urban growth poles to share prosperity, and reduce poverty by increasing opportunities. Improving connectivity is also crucial if Indonesia is to gain the most from the process of regional economic integration. Improved connectivity will increase Indonesia's capacity to respond to opportunities, boost cost competitiveness of businesses, and strengthen its attractiveness to investment. The Connectivity DPL-2 Project policy actions surround the following pillars: i) strengthening national coordination and regulation through establishment of regulatory and institutional frameworks for improved coordination and implementation of the connectivity agenda; ii) strengthening intra-island connectivity through improved connectivity among and between growth poles, with improved regulatory framework for land acquisition for public purpose development and optimal use of resources for sustainable improvement and maintenance of island transport network; iii) improving inter-island connectivity through strengthened ICT connectivity between eastern and western Indonesia and more competition in broadband services, and improving the efficiency of domestic shipping which is crucial to lower logistics costs in an archipelago like Indonesia; and iv) improving international connectivity (trade facilitation) by strengthening the institutions and processes in handling traffic and trade volume."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":56},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":27},"theme3":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":10},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Statutory Committee Report,Program Document,Letter of Development Policy","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BZ,CT,YZ,TZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"47,39,49","mjthemecode":"5,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":56},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":22},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":11},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b08214fad1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08214fad1_1_0","DocDate":"20-NOV-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Statutory Committee Report (SCR),  Vol.","DocType":"SCR","EntityID":"090224b08214faf8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08214faf8_1_0","DocDate":"01-NOV-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000456286_20131030150213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20131030150213","DocDate":"23-OCT-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Letter of Development Policy (DPL),  Vol.","DocType":"DPL","EntityID":"090224b08214faf4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08214faf4_1_0","DocDate":"23-SEP-2013"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
