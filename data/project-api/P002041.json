It will consist of a package of farm support services and physical infrastructure designed to benefit directly 55,000 smallholder farm families located in the northern part of Oyo State. Support services will include extension advice, crop protection measures, weed control, improved seeds, fertilizers, and the provision of credit facilities. Physical infrastructure will include constructing (550 kms.), improving (250 kms.), and maintaining gravelled feeder roads, constructing dams and wells, and establishing project headquarters and farm service centers. Consultant services will be engaged to recruit a project management team. The risks involved in the project are minor and will arise from failure to achieve the farmer adoption rate or to contract consultant services on time, but the basic agricultural package is simple and well tested."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"28,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924211341","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924211341","DocDate":"18-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902350380","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902350380","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e96186_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96186_1_0","DocDate":"29-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96184_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96184_1_0","DocDate":"29-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e976b2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976b2_1_0","DocDate":"29-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e976b1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976b1_1_0","DocDate":"29-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
