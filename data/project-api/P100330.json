Improving governance of Bangladesh Railway will contribute to the economic development of Bangladesh by improving transport services, government finances, and the investment climate in Bangladesh. The implementation of the reform program will help to (a) clarify relationship between GOB and BR and increase BR's autonomy and accountability, (b) improve corporate governance and management structure within BR so that BR is more commercially and market oriented, and (c) create an environment conducive to investment in railway operations. These will in turn yield more efficient rail operations and services to users, improve financial performance, and provide the basis for a growing use of railway system by business passengers."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"38,39,30","mjthemecode":"2,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090814003929","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090814003929","DocDate":"16-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"007412463_2007060516091763","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007412463_2007060516091763","DocDate":"15-FEB-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"007412463_2007060516091763","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007412463_2007060516091763","DocURL":"15-FEB-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000090341_20060927094423","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060927094423","DocDate":"20-SEP-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20060906092659","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20060906092659","DocDate":"31-AUG-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20060711091824","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20060711091824","DocDate":"20-JUN-2006"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
