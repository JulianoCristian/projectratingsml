The project consists of the following main components: 1) engineering analysis of the gas transmission and distribution systems; 2) physical reconstruction of the gas system; 3) technical assistance to Sarajevogas to implement the project and enhance institutional capacity in management, technical, and commercial/financial aspects; and 4) a district heating component covering goods and works to offset the Project Start-up Advance, which is to be used for project preparation and start-up activities."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":3},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"BA","sectorcode":"JB,LA,LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,81,84","mjthemecode":"11,11,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":94},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":3},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00030105341249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00030105341249","DocDate":"28-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123472931","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123472931","DocURL":"20-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123473132","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123473132","DocURL":"20-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3971229181109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229181109","DocDate":"13-NOV-1997"}],"countryname":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}},"facets":{}}
