The Global Environment Facility (GEF) will manage the Grant provided to the World Fish Center (International Center for Living Aquatic Resource Management - ICLARM), the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry areas, the African Center for Technology Studies, and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture. The project five components will: 1) develop a conceptual framework and set of outlines for the global, and sub-global assessments on the role of agricultural KST in reducing poverty and hunger, improving rural livelihoods and health, and facilitating an equitable, environmental, social, and economic sustainable development; 2) prepare, peer review, and approve a global assessment on the role of agricultural science and technology for development, comprised of four sections: a) context and concepts; b) plausible futures; c) options for making agricultural KST work more effectively to achieve the development, and sustainability goals; and, d) options for making agricultural KST effective in achieving the development and sustainability goals, i.e., investment and policy; 3) prepare, peer review, and approve five sub-global assessments on the role of agricultural science and technology for development - Central and West Asia and North Africa; East and South Asia and the Pacific; Latin America and the Caribbean; North America and Europe; and, Sub-Saharan Africa; 4) develop and implement a comprehensive outreach and comm"},"country_namecode":"World!$!1W","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"3,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"GEF Project Brief,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"1W","sectorcode":"AB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Human development","Rural development","Rural development","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"78,75,77,68,85","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,8,10,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":50},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"GEF Project Brief (GPB),  Vol.1","DocType":"GPB","EntityID":"000012009_20060530145909","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060530145909","DocDate":"01-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20060316094147","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060316094147","DocDate":"06-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20050816093743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050816093743","DocDate":"15-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20050815100835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050815100835","DocDate":"19-JUL-2005"}],"countryname":"World","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
