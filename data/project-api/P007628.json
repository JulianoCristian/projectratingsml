The project comprises two components.  The pilot component intends to finance the development, testing and evaluation of replicable techniques for the delivery of services in about eight medium-sized municipalities and one metropolitan area.  The national component, to be executed at the federal level, aims to finance technical assistance, consulting services, studies and equipment.  This last component furthermore seeks to help:  (i) define subsector policies and options for effective and efficient delivery of services and to reduce dependence on the Government's budgets.  It will also; (ii) strengthen institutions; (iii) develop plans to address subsector constraints; (iv) undertake plan preparation and prefeasibility studies in 26 selected cities; and (v) prepare follow-up solid waste management projects."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban environment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban environment"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"US","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban environment","code":"US"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214174751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214174751","DocDate":"03-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094547","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094547","DocDate":"31-MAR-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165518","DocDate":"31-MAR-1986"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
