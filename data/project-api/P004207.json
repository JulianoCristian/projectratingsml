IDA funds will be invested in rural infrastructure -- roads and water supply -- and will support the institutional strengthening of provincial planning and management. Parallel to IDA's project, the European Community's Laung Namtha Area Development Project will finance community development/income generating activities, concentrating on the geographical areas along the IDA financed roads. The road component will: (a) improve two roads totalling about 150 km to low-volume standards; (b) survey and design the Namtha-Nalae road; (c) develop the provincial Department of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (DCTPC); and (d) develop the local construction industry. The water component will: (a) rehabilitate and expand the water supply network, standpipes and sanitation program in the towns of Namtha and Singh; (b) provide a rural water scheme in the districts of Viengpuka and Long; and (c) provide technical assistance and training to develop, supervise and operate water and sanitation systems. The institutional strengthening component will: (a) set up a Planning, Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU) under the provincial governor's office to advise and train provincial counterparts in planning, budgeting and management as well as coordinating the technical assistance program; (b) introduce monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, and integrate relevant project procedures into regular provincial administrative activities; and (c) arrange for scholarships, short-term seminars, and domestic and regional training programs for provincial staff. To ensure sustainability after the project is completed, the technology chosen for operation and maintenance will be low-cost and unsophisticated."},"country_namecode":"Lao People's Democratic Republic!$!LA","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":4},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme4":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"9,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LA","sectorcode":"ET,BH,WC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"85,78,76,77","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,10,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":67},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":28},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4},{"Name":"Education","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030707113503","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030707113503","DocDate":"26-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122014589","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122014589","DocURL":"18-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122015091","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122015091","DocDate":"18-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122014790","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122014790","DocDate":"18-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122014589","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122014589","DocDate":"18-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122015091","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122015091","DocURL":"18-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b5a2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b5a2_1_0","DocDate":"15-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b59c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b59c_1_0","DocDate":"15-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005084805","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005084805","DocDate":"18-FEB-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005084520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005084520","DocDate":"18-FEB-1994"}],"countryname":"Lao People's Democratic Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
