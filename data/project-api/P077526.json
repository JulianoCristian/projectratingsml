The project has two main components: a) a sector restructuring component; and b) an investment component (the MW 100 combined cycle gas turbine Vlore thermal plant). The restructuring component of the project has been successfully implemented, laying out the framework for the establishment of an independent regulator and attracting private sector participation in distribution among other outcomes. The extension is necessary to ensure proper commissioning and trial operation of the Vlore Power Plant (VPP) as well as completion and testing of the permanent water intake pipe and all off-shore facilities. The Borrower, through its implementation agency, has proposed an acceptable action plan following on meetings with the contractor on June 15-16, 2010. Periodic review of implementation progress will take place to ensure achievement of the project's development objectives in a sustainable way."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
