The changes are to extend the project closing date by one year to December 31, 2013; reallocate the credit proceeds between categories; and drop the pilot component on local governance and community participation from the project. The one year extension is needed to ensure that the first tranche of road works are completed, to enable implementation of infill planting and extension activities which have recently commenced, and to allow sufficient time for some key studies to be completed. Under the restructuring, the scope of the project has to be scaled back quite significantly. Government has requested a revision in International Development Associations (IDA's) financing shares for different disbursement categories and for IDA to finance 100 percent of all eligible expenditures inclusive of taxes."},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine!$!PG","sector1":{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and
