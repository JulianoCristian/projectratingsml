During project preparation, each state would have prepared an overall UBE plan for the next five years, based on data analysis, and existing conditions, developing an implementation strategy. Under the first component, Bank assistance will be requested for: 1) institutional strengthening, including support for the Education Management Information System (EMIS) development; 2) increasing the quality of schools, which includes upgrading of physical infrastructure, teacher training, and learning materials; and, 3) increasing access to education, specially through incentives, and strengthening of community schools. The second component will focus on financing activities at the Federal level, namely the effective implementation of the UBE program, which requires considerable strengthening of the capacity of key federal institutions, responsible of policy development, and training of education planners, managers, and policy makers at all levels of the educational system. Capacity development activities include the areas of interaction between HIV/AIDS and education; institutional strengthening of the National Institute for Education Planning; collection, and analysis of education statistics; and, reform of the Inspectorate, among others."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":16},"totalcommamt":"101,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Agreement,Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Resettlement Plan,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"BH,BC,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Rural development","Human development"],"themecode":"88,78,26,59,65","mjthemecode":"8,7,2,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":55},{"Name":"Education","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2010102715141513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010102715141513","DocDate":"29-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20080721033216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080721033216","DocDate":"26-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080824234132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080824234132","DocDate":"30-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_03080804100669","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03080804100669","DocDate":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004092715054621","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004092715054621","DocURL":"15-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02082804004580","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02082804004580","DocDate":"15-AUG-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02032804085771","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02032804085771","DocDate":"29-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02080904120470","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02080904120470","DocDate":"22-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01122104032014","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01122104032014","DocDate":"18-JUL-2002"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
