This project proposes to help meet Indonesia's Drinking Water Decade target of providing piped water supply to 75% of the urban population by 1990. Its principal objectives are to: (a) provide low cost safe water supply to almost 720,000 persons by 1988, half of which are in the poverty group; (b) maintain tariffs affordable to all, including the poor; (c) develop financially autonomous water enterprises (PDAMs) to operate completed systems; and (d) train management, administrative and operations staff of the water sector. The proposed loan also includes provision of: (i) piped water supply systems; (ii) development of management and financial systems for eight water enterprises; (iii) training for water supply staff; and (iv) consulting services. Because it provides safe, potable water the project will have a positive environmental impact and improve the quality of life of persons in the beneficiary cities and towns."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925160115","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925160115","DocDate":"20-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e974a9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e974a9_1_0","DocDate":"03-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190241494","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190241494","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901013352","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901013352","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
