The new series will support policies and institutions aimed at developing a dynamic private sector to be the engine of sustainable growth and poverty reduction. In so doing, it will selectively support the Government's efforts in the five pillars of the GPRSP-II: government reform, human resources, competitiveness, economic infrastructure and social cohesion. The operation will have two main policy areas: (i) good governance; and (ii) competitiveness and growth. Good governance, broadly defined, includes fiscal policy, public financial management (PFM), procurement, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), statistics and state modernization. Competitiveness constitutes the main multi-sector anchor for the operation and includes human capital, trade, tourism, financial services, tax, land management and energy issues. The operation builds on the results achieved under PRSC I through IV, which supported policies and reforms in the health and education sectors that achieved sustained improvements in the well-being of the population. This new series marks a shift of Bank support from the health and education sectors towards growth and competitiveness. This shift reflects the new priorities of the Government's growth and poverty reduction strategy as well as the positive results obtained in the health and education sectors after a five-year period of sustained Bank involvement."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cabo Verde!$!CV","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"CV","sectorcode":"LZ,BH,FA,YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Financial and private sector development","Economic management"],"themecode":"22,40,23,27","mjthemecode":"2,1,4,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","code":"22"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20130718111230","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130718111230","DocDate":"21-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010010617034270","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010010617034270","DocDate":"18-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20091125012117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20091125012117","DocDate":"20-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090521103522","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090521103522","DocDate":"15-MAY-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cabo Verde"}},"facets":{}}
