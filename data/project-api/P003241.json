Based on priority attached to the water sector expressed in various fora by central and local government and by residents themselves, the project proposes to use water supply as an entry point for developing furture investment programs, initially concentrating on rehabilitation, in formal settlement areas and testing institutional options in peri-urban, unserviced areas. Both activities focus on a participatory demand-based approach, and as such, seek to break the persistent cycle of non-payment and inadequate service provision. Second, technical assistance and studies will be provided to support immediate improvements in participating council's management capacity and propose alternative methods of organizing services and evaluating trade-offs. Third, capacity building assistance will look to the medium term and outline how future urban policy can avoid mistakes of past policies. Project components comprise the following: 1) water supply and sanitation system rehabilitation; 2) community-based water and sanitation demonstration projects; and 3) sectoral and local government reform and capacity building."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":52},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":16},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":14},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"JB,BH,WS,WA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,84,71,74","mjthemecode":"9,9,11,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":52},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":17},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":16},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02071804015182","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071804015182","DocDate":"20-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121260050","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121260050","DocURL":"18-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23e73_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23e73_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019101817","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019101817","DocDate":"17-APR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia"}},"facets":{}}
