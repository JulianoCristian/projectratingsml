Due to the general level of poverty throughout the country, where 58 percent of the population lives on less than $1 per day, primary healthcare services are now provided free of charge, whereas hospital services are 97 percent subsidized by the Government of Lesotho, with a symbolic 3 percent co-payment by patients. The same subsidy will be applied by Government for the new hospital, since the overwhelming majority of the population served will be poor. Government is considering future implementation of a sliding fee scale, but this is not contemplated in the near future. Government has struggled to improve services at the existing hospital, which has been slated for replacement for over 10 years. The existing hospital was previously identified by the World Bank assessment as a disease vector, that is to say responsible for the spread rather than treatment of disease. The hospital, its staff and patients suffer from a chronic lack of resources required for the provision of medical services: hot water, heat, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, trained staff, and regularly functioning equipment. The hospital's budget has continued to increase as the level and quality of service outputs has decreased; in less than five years, the budget has doubled to almost $20 million. In the current economic and healthcare environment of Lesotho with looming fiscal constraints and increasing economic burden of HIV/AIDS and related conditions, this ineffective spending in such a critical sector is unsustainable. Government has decided to shift, where possible, from passive budget fulfillment to the PPP/output based approach for such critical sectors, with the new hospital PPP being the first"},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Lesotho!$!LS","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"6,250,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Program Information Document","countrycode":"LS","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000932506","geoLocName":"Maseru District","latitude":"-29.58333","longitude":"27.83333","country":"LS"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development","Human development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"69,93,67,63,64","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"8,8,8,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20131009141930","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20131009141930","DocDate":"20-SEP-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b08183c7a4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08183c7a4_1_0","DocDate":"25-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012062615162335","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012062615162335","DocDate":"26-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20111222232037","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20111222232037","DocDate":"20-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20111222231827","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20111222231827","DocDate":"14-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000310607_20070216114902","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070216114902","DocDate":"12-FEB-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000310607_20070216113832","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070216113832","DocDate":"02-FEB-2007"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Lesotho","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
