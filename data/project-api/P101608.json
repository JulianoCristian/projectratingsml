The additional credit will help finance the costs associated with: (a) implementation of expanded activities that consolidate and scale up the project impact under component A, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) control and eradication in the agricultural sector; and (b) scaling up of the successful pilots in strengthening human health systems in 51 additional districts in 11 provinces under component B, influenza prevention and pandemic preparedness in the health sector. There is no change to the original Project Development Objective (PDO). The results framework under the additional financing (AF) project is strengthened by adding an intermediate results indicator, namely the number of multi-sector simulation exercises conducted and reviewed at district level in the project provinces. There is no change to the project components, except that some scale up activities to address emerging zoonotic diseases are added. The project management structure at central and provincial levels will also remain unchanged. The central Project Coordination Units (PCUs) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be responsible for the implementation of the activities in animal health sector and human health sector under the AF project respectively. The Ministry of Health will be the lead agency for implementation of the AF project, instead of the Minist"},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"General public
