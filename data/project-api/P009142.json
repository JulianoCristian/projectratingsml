The principal objective of the projects is to rationalize production, reduce costs and improve product quality. The projects were selected by the Yugoslav Investment Bank as being of high economic priority in various sectors of industry. Their total cost is estimated at $37 million equivalent, including requirements for working capital. The direct foreign exchange component is estimated to be about $14 million, of which $10.5 million will come from the proposed bank loan and most of the rest from a loan of $2.8 million to one enterprise (OHIS) from U.K. sources. The local cost equivalent to $23 million will be provided by the enterprises themselves and through loans from Yugoslav banks."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67dcf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67dcf_1_0","DocDate":"18-JUL-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67dce_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67dce_1_0","DocDate":"18-JUL-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903005437","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903005437","DocDate":"30-JUN-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000094946_99112505313645","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99112505313645","DocDate":"29-JUN-1967"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
