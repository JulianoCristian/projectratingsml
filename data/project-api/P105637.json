While the macroeconomic situation is strong and reform progress is continuing, better outcomes, including higher growth and poverty reduction, require addressing areas of weakness in the investment climate; governance and public financial management; and service delivery. This DPL 4, a single-tranche operation based on completed actions demonstrating substantive progress, supports the Government reform program in these areas. DPL 4 builds on reforms undertaken under DPLs 1-3, complements a proposed program of Infrastructure DPLs, and sets the groundwork for an expanded policy dialogue for future DPLs under the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"600,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BH,EZ,FA,YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"28,25,40,49,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,5,4,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":55},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":30},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090814012029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090814012029","DocDate":"30-JAN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2008100309455989","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2008100309455989","DocDate":"12-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2008100309455989","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2008100309455989","DocURL":"12-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000310607_20071109102714","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20071109102714","DocDate":"31-OCT-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20071026112736","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20071026112736","DocDate":"23-OCT-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20071126145240","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20071126145240","DocDate":"19-JUN-2007"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
