The objectives include: 1) demobilization of an estimated 45,000 ex-combatants from the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA), and members of armed groups, while supporting their transition to civilian life; 2) supporting the reinsertion of ex-Forces Armees Rwandaises (FAR); 3) supporting the social and economic reintegration of all ex-combatants to be demobilized in stage II, and all stage I ex-combatants who remain socio-economically vulnerable; and, 4) facilitating the reallocation of Government expenditure form defense, to social and economic sectors. The project includes a quick disbursing mechanism that uses a positive list of imports, to generate counterpart funds to finance a rapid Program implementation. Nonetheless, the resumption of hostilities is the major external risk, while program specific risks are linked to weak implementation capacity."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Brief,Brief,Brief,Credit Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Technical Annex,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"JA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"27,51,58,59,88","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,7,7,6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":95},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150130133919","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150130133919","DocDate":"12-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150130132859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150130132859","DocDate":"12-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150130135236","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150130135236","DocDate":"12-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022516104159","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022516104159","DocDate":"25-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0112210401587","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0112210401587","DocDate":"11-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_02041104221775","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02041104221775","DocDate":"25-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02021604100944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02021604100944","DocDate":"25-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01112904013811","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01112904013811","DocDate":"26-OCT-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
