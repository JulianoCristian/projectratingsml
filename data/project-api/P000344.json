It consists of (a) a four-year program for the construction and improvement of about 2,200 km of feeder roads; (b) technical assistance to establish a Feeder Roads Unit within the Department of Roads, to implement the above program and train local staff; and (c) a study of a follow-up feeder road program and resources for feeder road maintenance. The project would have an important institution-building effect. The feeder roads to be included are indispensable for rural development in the project areas; four high priority rural development projects to be served by the roads are expected to improve the condition of some 100,000 low-income farm families."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cameroon!$!CM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"CM","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902290478","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902290478","DocDate":"30-NOV-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912165399","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912165399","DocDate":"30-NOV-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84bde_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84bde_1_0","DocDate":"15-NOV-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b72_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b72_1_0","DocDate":"15-NOV-1977"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cameroon"}},"facets":{}}
