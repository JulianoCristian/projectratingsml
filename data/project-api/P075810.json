The project is consistent with the macroeconomic program, and the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Government of Pakistan. Despite project benefits, this operation faces three types of risks: continuity risks, implementation capacity risks, and risks from external shocks. The Government has attempted to mitigate risks, through building consensus around the reform program, and, partnerships and reforms have been institutionalized in a number of bodies, both at the provincial, and local levels."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"JA,EP,YZ,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Economic management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"24,27,40,25,28","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,4,2,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20060117171009","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060117171009","DocDate":"19-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20030625132225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030625132225","DocDate":"19-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201314782","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201314782","DocURL":"10-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201315283","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201315283","DocURL":"10-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000094946_02061904011312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02061904011312","DocDate":"28-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02052404020925","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02052404020925","DocDate":"15-MAY-2002"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
