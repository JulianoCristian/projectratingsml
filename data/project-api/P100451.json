However, the Bank responded that it will be possible to re-allocate only SDR 143,074.17 as the amount of SDR 60,925.83 had been already disbursed by the Government in 2008 to establish the compensation fund. These funds had been kept in a separate account with the 'Tajprombank' commercial bank. Soon after the Government received the formal communication from the Bank, the disbursed amount of the compensation fund has been refunded back to the Bank. In addition, the Government has requested to re-allocate other grant proceeds in the amount of SDR 145,000 remaining in the operating costs disbursement category. The re-allocated funds will be used for procurement of priority equipment and other goods under the animal health and human health components. The project team fully supports the request as the re-allocation and extension will provide the Government with sufficient time and resources to successfully finalize the implementation of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration
