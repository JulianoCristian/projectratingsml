The PRSP has four strategic pillars: 1) accelerating broad-based growth; 2) promoting access to social services; 3) increasing employment and income-generating activities for the poor; and, 4) promoting good governance. The PRSC series supports the PRSP implementation under three components consistent with the four pillars of the PRSP: a) growth and employment creation; b) human resource development; and, c) good governance. Under the growth and employment creation component, the PRSC-6 supports institutional reforms that will increase private sector participation in the cotton, telecommunication, and energy sectors, accelerating growth through higher investment and improved productivity and competitiveness. The second component includes policies to lower the cost of services and improve access and quality in the education, health, social protection, and water sectors. The third component encompasses policy measures to strengthen budget formulation, execution, procurement, and control. This component also supports the strengthening of public sector performance, greater decentralization, and better environmental management. Project risks arise from the country's weak institutional capacity, adverse developments in commodity prices and exchange rates, and regional instability."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Sixi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le sixi\u00e8me Cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-6) fait partie d\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations \u00e0 l\u2019appui du Document de strat\u00e9gie de r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (DSRP) pour la p\u00e9riode 2004-2006. Le DSRP comporte quatre piliers strat\u00e9giques : La s\u00e9rie de cr\u00e9dits PRSC vient \u00e0 l\u2019appui des DSRP au titre des trois composantes correspondant aux quatre piliers des DSRP : a) croissance et cr\u00e9ation d\u2019emplois, b) d\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines, c) bonne gouvernance. Au titre de la composante de croissance et de cr\u00e9ation d\u2019emplois, le PRSC-6 appuie les r\u00e9formes institutionnelles qui permettront une plus grande participation du secteur priv\u00e9 dans les domaines du coton, des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications et de l\u2019\u00e9nergie, en acc\u00e9l\u00e9rant la croissance gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une augmentation des investissements et \u00e0 une am\u00e9lioration de la productivit\u00e9 et de la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9.
