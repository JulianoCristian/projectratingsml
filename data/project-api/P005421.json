The objectives of the reform program are to make the provision of education more equitable, more cost-effective, and more consistent with the country's medium-term development needs.  At the same time, the Government is developing and implementing a number of pedagogical measures to ensure that the quality of education is maintained or improved and that the coverage of the system is extended, even as unit costs of education are reduced.  More specifically, the project would assist the Borrower in improving:  (a) equity of education; (b) the efficiency of Morocco's education system; and (c) containing the growth of public expenditures on education.  The project includes a program of construction and equipping of schools, teacher training, foreign fellowships and studies in support of new educational activities."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20090122023233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090122023233","DocDate":"30-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925233944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925233944","DocDate":"17-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094522","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094522","DocDate":"28-FEB-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165346","DocDate":"28-FEB-1986"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
