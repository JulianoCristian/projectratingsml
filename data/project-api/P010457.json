The FW program will be strengthened through five components: (1) strengthening of FW service delivery, including extension and upgrading of infrastructure through construction of sub-centers and Primary Health Centers to serve as first referral units for obstetric emergencies, and strengthening of outreach and community linkages through setting up of mobile clinics and establishment of community linkages through setting up community volunteer networks; (2) rationalization of training institutions and planning, improvement of program logistics, and promotion of Non-Governmental Organization and private sector involvement; (3) strengthening of demand generation activities through improved information, education, and communication planning and activities; (4) strengthening of program management and implementation capacity; (5) a fund for innovative schemes aimed at improving service quality, and for preparation of FW investment proposals for the heavily tribal North-Eastern states."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"88,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Human development"],"themecode":"63,78,57,69,67","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02072504042455","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02072504042455","DocDate":"21-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123333261","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123333261","DocURL":"24-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123333362","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123333362","DocDate":"24-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123333060","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123333060","DocDate":"24-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123333261","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123333261","DocDate":"24-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123333060","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123333060","DocURL":"24-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123333362","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123333362","DocURL":"24-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b3d8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b3d8_1_0","DocDate":"16-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b3d6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b3d6_1_0","DocDate":"16-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006124419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006124419","DocDate":"26-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005214442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005214442","DocDate":"26-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
