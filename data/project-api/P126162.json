The INSTANSI DPL to Indonesia, for USD 300 million, marks the beginning of a new series of annual single-tranche DPLs. The operation is deeply rooted on the previous DPL series that consisted of: (i) first DPL series (DPLs 1-4), which was implemented from 2004 to 2007 and anchored to the FY04-08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS): (ii) second DPL series (DPLs 5-6) that was implemented from 2008-2009; and (iii) third DPL series, which was initially set out as a three-year DPL series (DPLs 7-9) to be implemented from 2010-2012. Initially focused on supporting the GoI's macroeconomic stabilization efforts, the previous DPL series covered a broad range of reform efforts aimed at improving the investment climate, strengthening public financial management and enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery. Given that the reform agenda is far from finished and an extension of the reforms is needed, the GoI has requested to terminate the ongoing third DPL series (DPLs 7-9) a year earlier and present the INSTANSI DPL as a new, two-year series. This new DPL series is still anchored under the FY09-12 country partnership strategy, and continues to deepen the reforms supported under the previous DPL series."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":56},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":12},"theme2":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":12},"theme4":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Program Document,Loan Agreement,Summary of Discussion,Letter of Development Policy","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BK,JB,BZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,53,54,28,57","mjthemecode":"7,2,6,6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":56},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":13},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000477144_20141231111615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000477144_20141231111615","DocDate":"22-OCT-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000386194_20121214005605","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121214005605","DocDate":"06-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b0817e746c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0817e746c_1_0","DocDate":"23-NOV-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000386194_20121130005344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121130005344","DocDate":"20-NOV-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Letter of Development Policy (DPL),  Vol.","DocType":"DPL","EntityID":"090224b081ca6d57_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ca6d57_1_0","DocDate":"05-OCT-2012"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
