Institutionally, the Project will enhance the Kampala City Council (KCC) management capacity, helping establish the infrastructure investment policies, and ultimately, support KCC's reform program. The project components include civil works regarding the rehabilitation of the main channel, construction of auxiliary drains, and, the rehabilitation of priority drainage. Consulting services for construction supervision will be financed by the project, as will the required program and policy studies, namely the Kampala Drainage Master Plan Study and the Kampala Urban Transportation Improvement Program Study. Institutional strengthening will support both, the KCC reform program under the strategic framework for reform, and the revenue enhancement program. To facilitate outsourcing of basic delivery functions, seed funds will be available, and training and implementation support will be further provided."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":79},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"22,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Flood protection"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"TA,BH,WD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Urban development","Social protection and risk management","Urban development"],"themecode":"72,52,74,73,85","mjthemecode":"11,9,9,6,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":79},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20041228095406","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041228095406","DocDate":"20-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050416313054","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050416313054","DocDate":"17-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031011291753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031011291753","DocDate":"17-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99042805372042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99042805372042","DocDate":"13-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99032505583978","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99032505583978","DocDate":"25-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_99061105313271","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99061105313271","DocDate":"28-FEB-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
