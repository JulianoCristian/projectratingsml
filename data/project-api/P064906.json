The components include: 1) subproject financing, to enable a continued support from the Emergency Social Investment Fund (FISE), in the replacement, expansion, and improvement of basic social services. Training in community organization, operations, and maintenance will be provided. The component aims at improving the quality, and comprehensiveness of investments; ensuring community participation; coordinating with service providers to ensure adequate supply-side interventions; and, addressing the specific needs of indigenous populations; 2) financing of participatory municipal planning, which includes technical assistance (TA), and training provision for communities, and municipalities alike, so as to be able to conduct future planning by themselves. Decentralization of subproject management will continue, through TA from FISE, while capacity building will be provided not only to communities, and municipalities, but to private stakeholders; 3) supporting the development of safety nets within a strengthened social protection strategy, and improved management of public investments in social areas, including monitoring and evaluation of safety net programs. An innovation fund will be established within FISE to pilot safety net measures for poverty reduction; and, 4) project management covering institutional strengthening, supply of equipment, and external auditing."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Nicaragua!$!NI","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":32},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"NI","sectorcode":"TZ,JA,BH,WZ,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"73,60,51,78,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,10,6,7,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":32},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080303022649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080303022649","DocDate":"27-SEP-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201202910","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201202910","DocURL":"06-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201203111","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201203111","DocURL":"06-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00110105335914","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00110105335914","DocDate":"30-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0104101108402","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0104101108402","DocDate":"23-MAR-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Nicaragua","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
