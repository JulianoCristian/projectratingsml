The project components include: (i) credit and other agricultural support services; (ii) the rehabilitation and expansion of irrigation works; (iii) construction and improvement of rural roads; (iv) rural electrification; and (v) other social services, e.g., provision of potable water and health services. The only special risk which this project faces would be the occurrence of organizational and management problems owing to Ecuador's little experience, to date, with integrated rural development projects of this type."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"18,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925025629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925025629","DocDate":"17-MAR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190232015","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190232015","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3e1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3e1_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912411453","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912411453","DocDate":"30-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100215225202","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100215225202","DocDate":"28-NOV-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
