It will also improve watershed conservation measures in the Upper Solo (Wongiri) watershed in Central Java, considered to be the most critical watershed in Indonesia because of erosion and high population density. Finally, it will strengthen management of five existing nature conservation areas, including buffer zone development to preclude exploitation by local inhabitants and technical assisstance for developing models for nationwide replication. Economic benefits expected are longer-term production from the forestry sector, more efficient and higher levels of output and incomes from the sector, better sustenance of the natural environment, and increased agricultural production, longer dam life, and lower irrigation costs in Wonogiri.."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":44},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":13},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":37},"theme1":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"34,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"AZ,BC,AB,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"86,82,85,80","mjthemecode":"11,11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":44},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":13},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":37}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3971104184428","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971104184428","DocDate":"11-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040514322336","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040514322336","DocDate":"20-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042815254835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042815254835","DocDate":"20-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926182031","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926182031","DocDate":"19-FEB-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
