To achieve these objectives, the project intends to provide funds for (i) training and fellowships; (ii) studies and research; (iii) instructional materials; (iv) related technical assistance; (v) equipment and furniture; and (vi) civil works.  When the facilities are fully operational in 1995, they would provide improvements to the quality of training directly benefitting about 253,000 trainees annually, and capacity for additional enrollments of 230,000 annually.  Project benefits would accrue to a wide range of participants in the labor force, from industrial technicians trained in advanced technologies to commercial and agricultural skilled workers. Estimates of the poverty impact of the project suggest that between 35 and 55 percent of total project costs would benefit poor individuals."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"74,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Agreement,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BC,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance","Human development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"51,65,25,66","mjthemecode":"8,2,8,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042713534258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042713534258","DocDate":"22-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926045955","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926045955","DocDate":"27-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032511571959","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032511571959","DocDate":"27-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042713515657","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042713515657","DocDate":"27-JUL-1987"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
