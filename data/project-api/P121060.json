The closing date of the project will be extended from December 31, 2012 until December 31, 2013. This is the first extension for the project. The extension is necessary to provide sufficient time for the deliveries to occur and the credit to be fully disbursed. The project faced several delays, some within the control of the government, while others not. Notably, the procurement through United Nation (UN) agencies took longer, despite a common agreement and prior clearance from Operational Policy and Country Services: Procurement (OPCSPR). Second, due to the high global demand of the certain public health commodities such as certain Anti Retroviral Medicines (ARVs), Long Lasting Insecticide Bed Nets (LLINs) and depo- provera, manufacturers have not been able to keep up with the demand and agreed delivery times for some of these products. Third, additional procedural requirements by the government of Mozambique have significantly increased the lead-time for awarding the contracts. The extension will ensure that all deliveries of the commodities currently under signed contract with providers are received and delivered to the key distribution points in the country."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Child
