There are two main project components. The first component restores access to basic health services and focuses on accelerated delivery of selected high priority programs (immunizations, TB, nutrition, health promotion) and service providers at the district level to provide a basic package of services. The transitional strategy also supports temporary repairs, some new building, and re-equipment. It re-establishes an administrative infrastructure and provides training for service delivery, management, and administration. It also prepares an action plan for excess hospital capacity. A major part of this component involves establishing pharmaceuticals/logistics systems. It will promote stakeholder participation through various consultation schemes. The second component addresses medium to long-term issues. Through capacity building, studies, and stakeholder consultations, it begins the process of defining and developing health policies appropriate to the country. It also supports a strategy for human resource development, technical assistance, and regulations for pharmaceuticals."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!$!TP","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":16},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"12,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TP","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,78,57,93,67","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":85},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050701094600","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050701094600","DocDate":"27-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051316010644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051316010644","DocDate":"07-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00082605403445","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082605403445","DocDate":"24-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00040503441331","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00040503441331","DocDate":"05-MAY-2000"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste"}},"facets":{}}
