There are eight project components: 1) River bank and dike fountain seepage protection will support river protection works. 2) Dike strengthening for Hubei and Hunan Provinces will support dike rehabilitation and seepage control, and cross-dike structures rehabilitation and replacement. 3) Dike monitoring and river modeling will set up a computerized system to monitor the seepage through the dike and settlement/deformation of the dike. 4) Equipment for dike maintenance will provide modern equipment for dike maintenance. 5) Resettlement will implement various housing and economic restoration measures to accommodate the 10,958 families affected. 6) Environmental management will support environmental measures detailed in the Environmental Management Plan. 7) Engineering and project management provides for the preparation of final designs and bidding documentation of the project works and construction supervision. 8) Institutional development, and flood prevention and disaster mitigation will provide technical assistance and training."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
