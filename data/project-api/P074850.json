Particular attention is to be given to the transport sector workers, the migrant population, commercial sex workers and the local populations living along the corridor, especially at the border towns. The project has the following three components: Component 1) will support: (a) the implementation of an integrated HIV/AIDS Information, Education, and Communication/Behavior change communication (IEC/BCC) policy along the transport corridor; and (b) the social marketing of condoms in the 8 geographic border communities and along the entire corridor. Both public sector and civil society organizations including NGOs and the private sector will participate in the implementation of both parts of this component. Component 2) will support: (a) strengthening of public and private (where applicable) health care facilities identified along the corridor to provide services in the areas of Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT), treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) (with promotion of the syndromic approach) and HIV/AIDS opportunistic infections; and (b) the provision of grants to Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), including NGOs and the private sector, to undertake community based initiatives in HIV/AIDS care and support and; (c) support the disposal of medical waste related to the project. Due to the complexity of the logistical and organizational requirements for anti-retroviral drugs, this project, with its regional nature and type of target groups, will not provide these drugs to the target groups. The project will also support the collection and analysis of information (not including private patient identifiable information) on patterns of utilization of HIV/AIDS treatment"},"country_namecode":"Africa!$!3A","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":41},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":27},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":16},"totalcommamt":"16,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"3A","sectorcode":"BC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Trade and integration","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"49,87,64,47,88","mjthemecode":"8,5,8,6,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":41},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":32},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":27}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080805030924","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080805030924","DocDate":"25-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000020439_20071001100901","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20071001100901","DocDate":"01-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062215504629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062215504629","DocDate":"18-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062215490228","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062215490228","DocDate":"18-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20031117104415","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20031117104415","DocDate":"29-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0111090401090","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0111090401090","DocDate":"21-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02112604013721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02112604013721","DocDate":"31-AUG-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02112604013720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02112604013720","DocDate":"31-AUG-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0206260400488","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0206260400488","DocDate":"11-JUN-2002"}],"countryname":"Africa"}},"facets":{}}
