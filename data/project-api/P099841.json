All planned activities will be completed before the closing date of March 31, 2011. As of January 15, 2011, the project has disbursed US$8.85 million of its overall financing envelope, including US$7.4 million of International Development Association (IDA) grant and credit (88 percent), and is expected to disburse 100 percent of proceeds by closing. The reallocation is necessary to finance a few final activities aimed at strengthening the project's development impact. The activities are: (i) expansion of the epidemiological surveillance system for infectious diseases and related user training; (ii) procurement of server software licenses for the system; (iii) procurement of a sampling truck for the Republican Veterinary Diagnostic Center; and (iv) implementation of a knowledge and practices survey amongst the public and health and veterinary professionals on matters related to avian, pandemic, and seasonal influenza."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration
