The project consists of three components. The first component, institutional development, is designed to: (a) introduce a municipal health management information system to support planning and monitoring of primary health care services; and (b) provide related training and technical support for municipal administrative authorities, municipal health administrators and community representatives, numbering about 6,000 in the project area. The second component, service development is designed to: (a) implement municipal subprojects, to be co-financed by the municipalities and the central government, to support a basic package of primary health care services by: providing medical supplies and equipment; and financing rehabilitation, expansion, construction and furnishing of selected primary health care facilities; and (b) provide related training and technical support for some 13,000 municipal health practitioners in the project area. The last component, policy development, will support the design and implementation of selected policy measures for introducing systematic pricing and cost-recovery for primary health services in the public system and for quality control for primary health care, and for strengthening employment system for public health personnel; and provide for an impact evaluation for the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"67,55,73","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"9,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01102704053742","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01102704053742","DocDate":"10-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122585546","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122585546","DocURL":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122585345","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122585345","DocDate":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122584943","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122584943","DocURL":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122585044","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122585044","DocURL":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122585345","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122585345","DocURL":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122584943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122584943","DocDate":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122585546","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122585546","DocDate":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122585044","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122585044","DocDate":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004100229","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004100229","DocDate":"14-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004095620","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004095620","DocDate":"14-MAY-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
