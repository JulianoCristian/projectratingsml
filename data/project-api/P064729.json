These practices, developed and applied for the protection and sustainable management of natural forest resources in pilot areas in China, will provide models for wider replication under the government's Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP). There are three main project components, which will be financed over a period of seven years. The first component includes the following subcomponents: 1) Natural forest management; yield regulation and control policy studies; implementation of forest management plans through demonstrations, non-timber forest products domestication, and establishment of yield plots to model growth and yield and assess biodiversity change; and monitoring and evaluation; 2) forest management training and vocational training; and community development activities. The Protected areas Management component supports conservation and improved management of biodiversity of global importance in selected, high priority nature reserves. The third component increases wood production to meet the growing gap between domestic supply and demand."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
