Implementation of this strategy is expected to result in a more equitable, relevant and efficient educational system where priority is given to the expansion of primary education and where secondary and higher education will develop in line with expected resource availability and labor market conditions.  In addition to supporting the Government's structural adjustment program generally, the project is designed around three components:  the first will reduce unit recurrent costs in primary education while improving quality and relevance.  The second will reduce unit capital costs and improve access to primary education while the third will promote a more cost-effective use of education resources."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Niger!$!NE","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"18,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NE","sectorcode":"BH,BC,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"65,61,57","mjthemecode":"7,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":55},{"Name":"Education","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20050304102407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050304102407","DocDate":"15-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170644","DocDate":"14-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36bbe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36bbe_1_0","DocDate":"18-NOV-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091518","DocDate":"31-OCT-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100428050543","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100428050543","DocDate":"28-OCT-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Niger"}},"facets":{}}
