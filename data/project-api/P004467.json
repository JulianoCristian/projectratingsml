The major components are aimed at assisting: (i) the Population Commission to improve and extend its programs to motivate family planning acceptance and to provide population training, and (ii) the Ministry of Health to improve and expand health and family planning services. The principal beneficiaries of the project will be lower income persons, mostly in rural areas, who, because of financial constraints, must depend upon the public sector for family planning and primary health care services. It is estimated that an additional 3.3 million persons will be provided with primary health care coverage, and another 3 million persons would have access to services from new health facilities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Targeted health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Targeted health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"HT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Targeted health","code":"HT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924173134","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924173134","DocDate":"15-FEB-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd1a1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd1a1_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902330948","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902330948","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
