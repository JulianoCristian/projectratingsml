The project will support the establishment of technical coordination mechanisms with other sectors, mainstreaming environmental issues in sectoral policy, and, by designing fiscal instruments to promote payment of municipal water fees, investments in municipal hydraulic works, and generate revenue from the use of national marine protected areas, including reinvestments related with the environmental management of these areas. Furthermore, the project will support the creation of an enabling environment to decentralize federal environmental management functions to the state level, by way of changes to key legislation; by the preparation of a staged decentralization strategy, specifying the criteria with respect to personnel, and goods; and by establishing the use of third party certification, to ensure the decentralization process. An implementation strategy will be developed to improve public access to information on environmental impact assessment, allowing the application of key legislation on the transparency of information. Risks however include vulnerability to external shocks, lack of stakeholder coordination, political constraints to future reforms, and financial resource constraints to decentralization of environmental functions. Nonetheless, risks have been taken into account in project design, emphasizing on coordination, and consensus building, and, Mexico should benefit from the recovery of the US economy, though timing remains uncertain."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"202,020,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"LZ,AT,YW,WZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"26,82","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":15},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080911000419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080911000419","DocDate":"03-MAR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20050804102723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050804102723","DocDate":"11-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20051013144350","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051013144350","DocDate":"11-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040719094039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040719094039","DocDate":"23-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000012009_20031222103200","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20031222103200","DocDate":"04-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201581001","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201581001","DocURL":"30-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201581001","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201581001","DocDate":"30-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000094946_02072304025616","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02072304025616","DocDate":"08-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02020104040982","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02020104040982","DocDate":"17-JUN-2002"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
