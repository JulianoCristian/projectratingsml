Over a 3-1/2 year period the project involves: (i) road maintenance equipment and workshop improvements to support a highway rehabilitation and maintenance program for unpaved roads in the two pilot regions; (ii) technical assistance for the training of training instructors, management, maintenance and workshop personnel; and (iii) technical assistance to help improve highway planning and to develop the local construction industry. The main benefits of the project would be to increase Congo's road maintenance management capacity, and help increase agricultural production in two important regions of the country by reducing transport costs to road users."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Congo!$!CG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"CG","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925111846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925111846","DocDate":"08-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190240598","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190240598","DocDate":"31-DEC-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97824_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97824_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Congo"}},"facets":{}}
