It would comprise two parts: Part I - the development of 3,900 hectares for irrigation; and Part II - flood protection works for an area of 6,000 hectares. The irrigated area would grow primarily high value crops for export. Part I would include a complete irrigation and drainage system and the on-farm works needed for intensive cropping; purchasing agricultural equipment; establishing perennial crops; setting up marketing facilities, including an orange packing plant; creating field trial farms; providing agricultural management, including technical assistance to farmers accompanied by credit facilities; preparing feasibility studies for future stages of the project; and training personnel abroad. Part II would consist of the construction of an interceptor channel to protect from flooding an area of 6,000 hectares of cultivable land, of which 3,200 hectares are presently under traditional cultivation; auxiliary civil works and the introduction of improved cropping practices under rain-fed agriculture."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000178830_98101912590258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912590258","DocDate":"21-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912373346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912373346","DocDate":"28-DEC-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903003634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903003634","DocDate":"30-JUN-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903491483","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903491483","DocDate":"30-JUN-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67dc9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67dc9_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67dc8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67dc8_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1967"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
