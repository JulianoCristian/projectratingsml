The project will benefit an area of about 640,000 ha covered by the NIS through:  (a) improvement of 18 NIS, urgent structural repairs in another 14 NIS, construction of three sediment excluders and improved water control structures on a pilot basis, and erosion prevention measures in critical areas; (b) continued support of the improved system-level operation and maintenance (O&M) services; (c) institutional development through: (i) strengthening of existing Irrigators' Associations (IAs), establishment of new IAs, and enhanced financial and management training; and (ii) strengthening of the National Irrigation Administration (through improvements in the Irrigation Service Fee collection process; staff training in O&M, appropriate engineering design techniques, farmer training techniques, etc; technical assistance for various studies, IA development work and staff training; and provision of high priority O&M equipment and materials; and (d) improved agricultural support services in the NIS areas including research and extension, farmer training in integrated pest management, and promotion of IA-based seed production.  A distinctive feature of the project is its emphasis on beneficiaries' participation in identification of specific deficiencies and required improvements of the NIS, and increasing responsibility for O&M of the relevant portions of the system serving them."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"51,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"AB,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,75","mjthemecode":"10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":99},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01070704011981","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01070704011981","DocDate":"13-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122582635","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122582635","DocURL":"09-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122582635","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122582635","DocDate":"09-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004045554","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004045554","DocDate":"28-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004045335","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004045335","DocDate":"22-APR-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
