It will:  (a) improve efficiency in the allocation of resources within the judiciary; (b) increase courtroom productivity and efficiency; and (c) reduce the private sector costs of dispute resolution.  To achieve these objectives the project will support institutional development of the courts and of the Judicial Council, which is responsible for overall court administration, as follows:  (a) strengthen the planning, budgeting, and management capacity of the Judicial Council, including the design and implementation of an information system to provide quantifiable performance indicators; (b) improve courtroom productivity and efficiency through reorganization and streamlining courtroom administrative procedures, including automation of caseload and courtroom management; (c) strengthen the administrative capacity and specialized legal knowledge of court personnel, including knowledge pertinent to commercial and business litigation, by strengthening the capacity of the Judicial School to design and deliver training; and (d) rehabilitate existing and construct new courtroom facilities."},"country_namecode":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela!$!VE","sector1":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Access to law and justice","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"VE","sectorcode":"BG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Rule of law","Rule of law"],"themecode":"31,32,34","mjthemecode":"3,3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Access to law and justice","code":"31"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20030709135851","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030709135851","DocDate":"28-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200093417","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200093417","DocURL":"30-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200093518","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200093518","DocURL":"30-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200093216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200093216","DocDate":"30-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200093417","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200093417","DocDate":"30-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200093216","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200093216","DocURL":"30-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200093518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200093518","DocDate":"30-DEC-1993"}],"countryname":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela"}},"facets":{}}
