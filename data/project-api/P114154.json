The closing date for the project will be extended from December 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013. The RTG has so far withdrawn USD100 million and intends to withdraw the remaining USD900 million in support of the implementation of their FY2013 budget; in particular, the extension will enable the withdrawals to be more aligned with the implementation of the RTG's investment plans for FY2013 (October 2012-September 2013) which will mostly be in the first half of 2013. The extension will also be helpful in lowering the cost of swapping the PSRDPL proceeds from US dollars to Thai Baht for the RTG. The baht swap market is quite thin and is therefore volatile. The extension of the PSRDPL closing date to June 2013 will make it difficult for speculative investors to predict when the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will make the swaps and how much each time. The extension will also allow the MOF to make swaps in smaller amounts at a time - which will not swing the swap market by too much which is undesirable by (and may hurt) other non-speculative clients in the swap market (e.g. exporters). This will be the second extension of the project, and a cumulative extension of nine months."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":8},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":9},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"1,000,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Board Summary,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"25,39,23,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,1,4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":92},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000456286_20140417134428","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20140417134428","DocDate":"21-MAR-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b0818c9288_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0818c9288_1_0","DocDate":"27-JAN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20121210233036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121210233036","DocDate":"03-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20121210232718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121210232718","DocDate":"30-NOV-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012062519365583","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012062519365583","DocDate":"25-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Summary (SU),  Vol.1","DocType":"SU","EntityID":"000333038_20101122235148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20101122235148","DocDate":"18-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000356161_20101029014024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101029014024","DocDate":"21-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20081219100948","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20081219100948","DocDate":"13-NOV-2008"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
