About 10,500 pure bred cattle would be imported to serve as a nucleus of genetically superior stock for upgrading the national herd. The project would also provide project farmers with varied farm machinery (tractors, sowing and harvesting equipment, milking machines, pumps and tools) associated with dairy farming. Three individual technical specialists would provide technical assistance in planning, extension, and supervision services which would be provided by IDPD. Training of local technicians would be provided both locally and abroad. The project includes production and marketing studies for subsequent development of the dairy industry, and those for the preparation of a future intensive dairy development project in additional provinces."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"21,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925003718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925003718","DocDate":"31-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902262863","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902262863","DocDate":"31-MAY-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101911024147","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101911024147","DocDate":"31-MAY-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b802_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b802_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAY-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b800_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b800_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAY-1976"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
