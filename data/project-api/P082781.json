This will provide an enabling environment to restart prudent lending, ultimately boosting economic growth. The Bank/Association's (hereinafter called the Bank) strategy for Bolivia's financial and corporate sectors calls for operations in a programmatic context, each focusing on distinct policy measures and actions that, taken as a whole, would contribute to the strengthening of the financial and corporate sectors and support the Government's BCRP. The Government's program, supported by this operation, involves seven main components: (a) organizational arrangements to manage systemic bank and corporate restructuring, (b) legal clarity on appropriate distribution of  regulatory powers, (c) bank and corporate diagnosis; (d) prudential strengthening and prompt corrective action for banks; (d) bank resolution framework; (e) legal and institutional framework for corporate restructuring; and (f) anti-money laundering. Such comprehensive and cohesive program is essential to realign incentives and set in motion a process where: (i) viable banks participate in the restructuring of troubled but viable corporations that make the needed efforts to restore their financial health, (ii) troubled but viable banks restructure and regain medium-term profitability, and (iii) unviable banks and corporations exit the system in an orderly manner. While the first Loan/Credit would have conditionality largely based on actions in the banking sector, the second loan would follow a similar design, but with flexibility to include conditionality on the corporate sector if sufficient "},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"International financial architecture","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"BG,YW,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,43,46,40","mjthemecode":"4,5,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"International financial architecture","code":"46"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":60},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070509103528","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070509103528","DocDate":"31-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2005011412261632","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2005011412261632","DocURL":"21-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2005011412263333","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2005011412263333","DocDate":"21-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2005011412261632","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2005011412261632","DocDate":"21-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2005011412263333","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2005011412263333","DocURL":"21-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20040617174042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040617174042","DocDate":"12-JAN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000160016_20040115110441","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040115110441","DocDate":"08-JAN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000160016_20040108121419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040108121419","DocDate":"07-JAN-2004"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
