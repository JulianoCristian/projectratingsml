The proposed project would develop within the Forest Department a capacity to operate an integrated logging and reforestation program to support the long-term development of forest plantation and locally-based wood industries. The project would include clearfelling and extraction of merchantable trees from degraded forests in preparation for establishing 2,800 ha of plantations in the Phuntsholing and Gaylegphug areas located in Southern Bhutan and where increasing degradation of natural forests presents significant risks of ecological damage.The project would also establish nurseries to support the plantation program and construct and maintain the necessary access roads. Technical assistance would help the Forest Department with project implementation and training of staff in log extraction, road construction and plantation establishment."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Bhutan!$!BT","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BT","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05bd5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05bd5_1_0","DocDate":"17-APR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902440258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902440258","DocDate":"31-MAR-1984"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Bhutan"}},"facets":{}}
