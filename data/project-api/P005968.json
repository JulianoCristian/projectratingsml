To this end, the proposed project consists of three elements.  Part A involves a program for improving the efficiency of SEGBA, including a loss reduction program.  Part B entails rehabilitation and expansion of SEGBA's distribution network through financing of part of SEGBA's 1988-1992 least-cost investment program.  Finally, Part C provides support for SEGBA's training program.  The project would benefit about 3.7 million consumers now living in the borrower's concession area through the improvements of the reliability of electricity services and 400,000 new consumers that are expected to be connected in the period 1988-1992.  The project is also expected to ensure that energy is used efficiently and losses reduced and to reduce SEGBA's reliance on budget support."},"country_namecode":"Argentine
