There are three project components. The first funds adaptive research and technology dissemination, and supports agricultural practices to reduce environmental pollution. The second component reforms the agricultural research system. The third component finances a pilot pollution control program that promotes efficient manure management practices; adapts research, conducts on-farm testing, and demonstrates the use of bio-gas digesters in villages; and sets up a watershed-scale water quality monitoring program."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"7,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GE","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Trade and integration","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,48,75,57","mjthemecode":"7,10,5,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20090813020244","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090813020244","DocDate":"23-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030410011167","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030410011167","DocDate":"22-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052411055768","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052411055768","DocDate":"22-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00041905512369","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00041905512369","DocDate":"11-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00101905434251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00101905434251","DocDate":"20-SEP-1999"}],"countryname":"Georgia"}},"facets":{}}
