There are four project components. 1) Real estate registration component will support the Government's national program for privatizing and titling state and collective farm land; and develop and implement the organizational and legal framework for a unified real estate cadastre system. 2) Rural finance component will pilot a mechanism to increase the availability in rural areas of market based credit and deposit services for rural households, enterprises, and farms. In particular, the component will establish two types of local financial intermediaries -- credit cooperatives and groups of jointly liable borrowers. 3) Information and advisory services component will increase farmers access to information, advice, and training. It will build capacity for the provision of such services in the private and public sectors, assemble useful technology and advice, and develop suitable delivery mechanisms. 4) Rural policy unit will be set up to assist the Government to develop a strategy to maintain the competitiveness of agriculture in face of the potential impact on the real exchange rate of developments in the oil sector and related issues of agricultural sector management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Azerbaijan!$!AZ","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AZ","sectorcode":"BC,BH,AB,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Rural development","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"83,26,78,77,41","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,10,10,2,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":43},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":32},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333038_20080820011126","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080820011126","DocDate":"28-JUL-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060621111204","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060621111204","DocDate":"30-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123545930","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123545930","DocURL":"04-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123545930","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123545930","DocDate":"04-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99060411143159","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99060411143159","DocDate":"10-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703532477","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703532477","DocDate":"23-SEP-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Azerbaijan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
