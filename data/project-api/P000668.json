The major part of the program consists of improvements in local and long distance telephone networks (US$9 million for each). An additional US$1 million is included for telegraph, telex and high frequency radio. The rest of the program is comprised of land and buildings, miscellaneous items, and provision for contingencies. The economic rate of return, as a measure of the economic progress made possible by better communication, is difficult to measure. However it may be argued that the prices which users are willing to pay for telecommunications services give at least a minimum indication of this value. The incremental rate of return on the proposed investment, valuing services at current tariffs, is 15 percent."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"4,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"CC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","code":"CC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912144277","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912144277","DocDate":"22-JUN-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903131494","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903131494","DocDate":"31-MAY-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67e5d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67e5d_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAY-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e67e5c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67e5c_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAY-1969"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
