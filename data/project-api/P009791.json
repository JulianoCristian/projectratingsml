Benefits to be gained include the alleviation of India's shortage of newsprint through the introduction of a new technology utilizing a readily-available raw material. The risk of using a new technology would be minimized by the fact that the mill could easily be converted to the production of 80,000 tpy of printing and writing paper from bagasse by a commercially proven process. The risk of an inadequate coal supply would be minimized by the securing of alternative fuels."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Procurement Plan,Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000334955_20091223020641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20091223020641","DocDate":"12-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925065051","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925065051","DocDate":"01-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e976cd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976cd_1_0","DocDate":"15-SEP-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e976cb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976cb_1_0","DocDate":"15-SEP-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e976ca_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976ca_1_0","DocDate":"15-SEP-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e976c9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976c9_1_0","DocDate":"15-SEP-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912523695","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912523695","DocDate":"31-AUG-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902381468","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902381468","DocDate":"31-AUG-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
