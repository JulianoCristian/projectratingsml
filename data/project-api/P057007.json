The project will contribute to : i) decreasing infrastructure-related market and distribution costs countrywide; ii) securing the timely delivery of social services to the affected population; iii) facilitating the productive settlement of war refugees in Northern Uganda; and iv) stabilizing the eco-system near the affected roads. The project consists of four components. First, repair of damaged road sections will support repairs and replacement of pipe culverts on 96 identified sections of road countrywide. Second, rehabilitation and regravelling of Atiak-Moyo Road will comprise rehabilitation/regravelling of 90 kilometers of gravel road as well as repairs of five bridges and two ferry landings. The third component will repair or replace box culverts and about 120 bridges. The fourth component is the procurement of pipe culverts and Bailey Bridge sections. Finally, the fifth component will finance consultant services for engineering studies and civil work supervision."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"27,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Social protection and risk management","Urban development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,71,52,45","mjthemecode":"5,6,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040915135329","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040915135329","DocDate":"28-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200594952","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200594952","DocURL":"14-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200594952","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200594952","DocDate":"14-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980624085906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624085906","DocDate":"07-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929174020","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929174020","DocDate":"27-FEB-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
