By 1980 ships drawing up to 16.1 meters (53 feet) will be able to use it. This will include almost all the world shipping fleet except for the larger tankers which still could not pass when fully loaded. The project includes dry excavation and dredging to widen and deepen the canal; breakwater construction; miscellaneous civil works of mooring facilities, workshops and a training center; equipment and material procurement; and technical assistance. The project generates economic benefits to Egypt through increased canal revenues, to ship owners who will benefit from shorter routes and possibly to consignors and recipients of freight through reduced freight rates. The benefits have been estimated on the basis of very conservative traffic forecasts."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924235746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924235746","DocDate":"01-APR-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84ba0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84ba0_1_0","DocDate":"09-AUG-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84b9f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84b9f_1_0","DocDate":"09-AUG-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902281165","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902281165","DocDate":"31-JUL-1977"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
