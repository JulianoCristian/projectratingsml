Tajikistan is suffering from multiple stresses, compounded by the global food crisis. The extremely harsh winter of 2007-08, combined with power shortages and high energy prices, has already imposed great hardship and rising expenses on the population, particularly in rural areas. The sharply rising prices of imported food have exacerbated the difficulties for the poor. The country now faces a food shortage, high food prices, and a locust infestation. A United Nation (UN) flash appeal was conducted to address the humanitarian crisis following the severe winter, including measures to address the food crisis. More recently Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), World Food Program (WFP), and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) are conducting a needs assessment which has identified urgent priorities including: i) nutrition (special emphasis on children); and ii) providing agricultural inputs to the most needy and vulnerable the country. The Government has made an urgent plea for support from the international community. There are three components to the project. The first component is the support for agricultural inputs. The second component is the improvement of livestock health and husbandry. Finally, the third component is the project management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Animal
