It focuses on communicable diseases, common nutritional disorders, environmental health and hygiene, reproductive health care, immunization, the treatment and control of basic infectious diseases like upper respiratory tract infections, the control of epidemic diseases like malaria, and the control of sexually transmitted diseases especially HIV/AIDS. The project has eight components. They 1) expand primary health care access; 2) improve the technical quality of primary health care service provision; 3) expand the supply and productivity of health personnel; 4) ensure a regular and safe supply of effective, safe, and affordable high quality drugs while improving prescribing behavior by health providers; 5) improve awareness about personal and environmental hygiene and basic knowledge of common diseases and their causes as well as promote political and community support for health services; 6) transform the health system into a four-tiered system that is linked, equitably distributed, and managed in a decentralized, participatory, and efficient manner; 7) monitor improvements in service delivery, quality, and financial performance and evaluate the impact, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the project's components; and 8) improve financial sustainability."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":1},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Malaria","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"BC,BK,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Public sector governance","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"68,92,26,67,69","mjthemecode":"8,8,2,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Malaria","code":"92"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000020439_20071029144256","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20071029144256","DocDate":"01-OCT-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070820105110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070820105110","DocDate":"17-AUG-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121321050","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121321050","DocURL":"30-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121321050","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121321050","DocDate":"30-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000178830_98111703551173","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703551173","DocDate":"24-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173559","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173559","DocDate":"13-AUG-1998"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
