Phase I will highlight the policies and instruments to improve the access of the poor to health-promoting programs and services while preparing the analytical work and sensitizing stakeholders to more complex systemic reforms. The project components include: 1) Strengthening health demand - implementation of Seguro Materno Infantil (SMI) which aims to reduce infant and maternal mortality by improving access of poor pregnant mothers and small children to quality healthcare. The program will reimburse health providers for services rendered free of charge. 2) Strengthening decentralization, policy development, and institutional modernization will support expansion of community-managed health facilities (CLAS) and empowerment of communities, strengthen the capacity of municipalities and regional health boards (DISA), support the reorientation of the role of Ministry of Health (MINSA) and public/private health providers, and support the development of a new unified information system for service produciton. 3) Improving the supply and quality of health programs and services will finance regional and local health plans. 4) A project coordination unit will be established to coordinate project implementation.
