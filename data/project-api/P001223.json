It would provide credit for on-farm development and husbandry improvement to about 8,000 selected smallholders on an area of about 80,000 acres. The work to be financed would include land clearance, deep plowing, initial supply and application of fertilizer and pesticides, watering facilities, farm buildings and provision of graded milk cows raised in other areas of Kenya. The project would also provide credit for the purchase of tractors and attachments to meet the increased demand for mechanical land preparation arising from the project, and would include the strengthening of the financial and technical services necessary to administer the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"3,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000178830_98101912500340","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912500340","DocDate":"05-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e840_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e840_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAY-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e83e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e83e_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAY-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902592421","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902592421","DocDate":"30-APR-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903490159","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903490159","DocDate":"30-APR-1967"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
