Transformer stations will be built and the capacity at the existing substations will be increased. The transmission system will be extended and reinforced by constructing overhead lines, rebuilding existing lines and installing of underground cables. Distribution substation capacity will be increased almost 50 percent by building 33 new substations and by increasing capacities at 101 existing substations. The distribution systems will require the installation of 63,500 km of overhead conductor and 843 km of underground cable and an increase of 35 percent in the installed distribution transformer capacity. One underground network will be added in the Sao Paulo area. Supervisory control equipment will be provided to control some distribution substations from area centers. Static capacitors will be installed for power factor correction."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912592298","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912592298","DocDate":"31-MAR-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902194530","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902194530","DocDate":"31-MAR-1973"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
