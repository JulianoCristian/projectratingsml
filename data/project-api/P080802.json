The project will finance: a) reconstruction of housing, and social and public infrastructure; b) economic recovery to reduce vulnerability; c) capacity building and project management; and, d) disaster insurance preparation. The project will directly benefit affected populations, by supporting the restoration of economic activities, in particular, agricultural production, which is the main source of income in the affected areas. Technical assistance will provide wider public benefits, by strengthening the public sector capacity, to become responsive in the face of natural disasters. However, the major risk is the potential delay in project implementation, given limited knowledge of both the implementing agency in procurement procedures, and the Bank with Iranian authorities. To minimize this risk, at appraisal time, procurement training was provided to Government authorities, while finance management training will be provided to the Project Management Unit during implementation, in addition to intensive Bank supervision closely monitoring implementation. Furthermore, the insurance component creates another risk, in that it requires a separate committee and a working group, but provision of technical assistance, including studies, advisory services, and the preparation of a regulatory reform, should minimize this risk."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Iran!$!IR","sector1":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"180,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Housing construction"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Environmental Assessment,Technical Annex,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"IR","sectorcode":"WZ,EZ,AZ,TA,YC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Urban development","Rural development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,78,71,52","mjthemecode":"6,9,10,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":35},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":25},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100928010449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100928010449","DocDate":"30-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202190110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202190110","DocDate":"28-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202190110","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202190110","DocURL":"28-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03060704072181","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03060704072181","DocDate":"31-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_03051404101830","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03051404101830","DocDate":"05-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02112004012967","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02112004012967","DocDate":"13-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02103104330644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02103104330644","DocDate":"06-OCT-2002"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Iran"}},"facets":{}}
