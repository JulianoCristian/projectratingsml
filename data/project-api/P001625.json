It will achieve this by:  (a) introducing a new intermediate standard of housing development between the existing high-cost permanent housing and traditional structures; and (b) expanding greatly the use of private mortgage funds to provide financing for such housing.  The project will further aim to achieve the government's objective by:  (c) restructuring the Malawi Housing Corporation to play a more active role in market-oriented housing development; and (d) helping the Government find long-term solutions to the pervasive problem of housing subsidies.  The project will also provide financing for Malawi's low-cost traditional housing area program, and technical assistance to assist in removing legal and technical bottlenecks to low-cost housing development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"UH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban housing","code":"UH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007121043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007121043","DocDate":"24-OCT-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151407","DocDate":"30-NOV-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05cbd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05cbd_1_0","DocDate":"27-NOV-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904162057","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904162057","DocDate":"31-OCT-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
