The government will attempt to achieve this aim by arresting soil erosion and introducing modern agricultural practices in the project area leading to integrated crop and livestock farming on a rotational basis. This rotation method combines better cultivation techniques with controlled grazing of stock. But the farmer will need education, persuasion and demonstration before accepting these new methods. The project therefore provides training, extension services and research facilities to help introduce the new concept of farming. The government's new grazing control and pasture management regulations will assist in bringing about necessary changes in land use and grazing patterns. The main project components are (a) farm inputs as short-term credit in kind; (b) medium-term credit for tractors and dairy cattle; (c) extension services; (d) marketing; (e) training and research; (f) road development and soil conservation."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Lesotho!$!LS","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"LS","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912470821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912470821","DocDate":"17-AUG-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902195141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902195141","DocDate":"28-FEB-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de3548_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de3548_1_0","DocDate":"22-FEB-1973"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Lesotho"}},"facets":{}}
