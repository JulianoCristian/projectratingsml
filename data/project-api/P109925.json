The closing date of the project will be extended from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012 in order to allow sufficient time to complete ongoing civil works (construction of schools) that were delayed because of recent floods. This will be the second extension and a cumulative extension of 30 months. Due to the heavy flooding that affected Cambodia in October 2011, progress on civil work activities was significantly delayed. The reallocation will finance the expansion of teacher training to focus on improving reading competencies of students in early grades and other prioritized in-service training to support sustainability after project closing. Provision of the in-service training activities is expected to reduce the high drop-out and repetition rate, thereby increasing the completion rate of the primary education cycle."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Cambodia!$!KH","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":71},"sector2":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government
