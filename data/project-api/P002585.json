The proposed pilot operation would retain the long term objective of the earlier project, however, by helping lay the foundation for long term development of Western Sudan. It would: (a) test strategies for improving livestock and range production; (b) identify and test agronomic packages and extension methods for crop production, both for area extension and yield increase; and (c) test approaches to settlement and soil conservation. The major risks now foreseen include establishment of a relatively stable system of animal husbandry and crop production in an area where transhuman populations have traditionally predominated. The pilot project is intended to provide the incentives and support facilities to help carry out this transformation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Sudan!$!SD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"13,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SD","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04322_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04322_1_0","DocDate":"06-OCT-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04320_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04320_1_0","DocDate":"06-OCT-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902381060","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902381060","DocDate":"31-AUG-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912541659","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912541659","DocDate":"31-JUL-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Sudan"}},"facets":{}}
