Because education is moving toward being decentralized, another important objective of the project is to help states develop their own capacity for managing the system efficiently.  Toward these ends the project will:  (a) increase student access to textbooks and other instructional materials; (b) improve teachers' skills and effectiveness in teaching; (c) improve the education management capacity of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and of the State Education Secretariats (SES); and (d) develop MOE's capacity to coordinate and formulate policies, monitor student learning and school quality, and identify bottlenecks and problems at the state and local levels in a timely manner.  The project consists of four components:  (a) instructional materials development; (b) teacher training; (c) institutional development; and (d) studies of school effectiveness and educational finance and the identification and design of activities to improve the quality of education."},"country_namecode":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela!$!VE","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":46},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"89,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"VE","sectorcode":"BH,BC,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,65,73","mjthemecode":"9,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":46},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00112905313060","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112905313060","DocDate":"23-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200115814","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200115814","DocURL":"28-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200120015","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200120015","DocURL":"28-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200115713","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200115713","DocDate":"28-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200115814","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200115814","DocDate":"28-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200115713","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200115713","DocURL":"28-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200120015","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200120015","DocDate":"28-DEC-1993"}],"countryname":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela"}},"facets":{}}
