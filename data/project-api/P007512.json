In the Region Lagunera District the irrigated area would be expanded from 52,660 hectares to approximately 85,000; in the San Juan del Rio District the increase would be from 5,400 hectares to approximately 10,000. In addition, the project would regulate the water supply and reduce damage from floods; it would also reduce the construction or rehabilitation of 620 km of roads in the project areas. Adequate agricultural extension services, including demonstration programs and long, medium and short-term credit to farmers would be assured by the Government."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"19,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67d26_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67d26_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAY-1966"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67d25_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67d25_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAY-1966"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902533551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902533551","DocDate":"30-APR-1966"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903484116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903484116","DocDate":"30-APR-1966"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
