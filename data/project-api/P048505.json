There are three components. The first, productive investment, finances small grants for demand-driven subprojects aimed at small irrigation development and modernization, improved pasture establishment and management, and improved dairy production technology and marketing as well as subprojects providing small-scale on-farm infrastructure and minor equipment and supplies. The second component, production support services, includes financial support for applied research and technology transfer as well as demand-driven extension, and technical assistance and training to small farmers. The third component, institutional strengthening and project administration, supports training and technical assistance to staff with implementation responsibilities at the central and state levels, with particular emphasis on preparing subprojects, selecting mechanisms and procedures, developing and implementing a comprehensive monitoring and impact evaluation system, and establishing and operating a project coordination team."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"444,450,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BH,BC,AB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,26,78,75","mjthemecode":"10,10,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":60},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":32},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20050830101855","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050830101855","DocDate":"22-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040630094834","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040630094834","DocDate":"24-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042911084862","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042911084862","DocDate":"20-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042013223563","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042013223563","DocDate":"11-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040812153964","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040812153964","DocDate":"11-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910543472","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910543472","DocDate":"30-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911063049","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911063049","DocDate":"28-OCT-1998"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
