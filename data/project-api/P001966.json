Specifically, the project seeks to (i) promote firewood conservation, substitution of energy sources and a more effective management of natural forest cover; (ii) promote the development of renewable energy technologies; and (iii) promote the conservation of electric power and provide electricity at least cost.  Furthermore, it intends to (iv) upgrade local capabilities to administer petroleum exploration.  To that end, the project comprises elements of policy reform as well as investment.  The reforms focus on:  (i) adjusting household energy prices to encourage efficient use of energy; (ii) changing the way firewood supply is managed; and (iii) helping implement needed institutional and organizational changes in the power sector.  In addition, the project consists of investments in (i) household energy; (ii) electric power; and (iii) petroleum."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Niger!$!NE","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and
