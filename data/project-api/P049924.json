Furthermore, improved policies will be developed, particularly through the implementation of sector reforms. The components call for: 1) sector reform, and institutional development, supporting a major restructuring of the Sub-Secretaria de Saneamiento Ambiental (SSA), to enable the agency formulate sector policies, and set general regulatory guidelines. Provision of technical assistance, and training to municipalities, and sector institutions, will enable SSA to define increased water, and sanitation coverage, and, set up a sector information system. Further training programs will be financed, which will allow non-governmental organizations, and private providers assume their roles in the new sector structure; 2) implementation of subprojects in rural areas, financing engineering, and infrastructure works in water and sanitation aspects, and, providing management training to the community, as well as health and hygiene education; and, 3) provision of non-refundable grants, to finance engineering studies, and civil works for water, and sanitation subprojects in municipal capitals."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":29},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":21},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":18},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Brief,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"BC,BH,JB,WC,WA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,74,84,78,57","mjthemecode":"7,10,11,9,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":29},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":29},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":21},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":18},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070628083649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070628083649","DocDate":"26-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333038_20081029033358","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081029033358","DocDate":"01-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201541844","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201541844","DocURL":"11-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99052602424811","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99052602424811","DocDate":"25-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00092805302221","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00092805302221","DocDate":"20-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061011590137","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061011590137","DocDate":"10-MAR-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
