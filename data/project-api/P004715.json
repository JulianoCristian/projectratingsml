The project includes: (a) construction and/or improvement of main, lateral and tertiary canals and drains (including adjacent farm roads) for irrigation of an area of about 27,000 hectares on the left bank of the Mae Klong River (East and West Malaiman areas); (b) review of RID's organization with a view to determining staffing, training and reorganization requirements and implementation of a plan of action for strengthening RID; and (c) preparation of future irrigation projects. The project will directly benefit some 6,800 farm families, about 40 percent of whom at present have incomes below the absolute poverty level. A further 2,000 landless agricultural households living in the project area will also benefit because of the additional labor demand generated by the project. The project entails no unusual risks."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"57,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924223623","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924223623","DocDate":"21-DEC-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925070428","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925070428","DocDate":"11-DEC-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902380037","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902380037","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912524921","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912524921","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
