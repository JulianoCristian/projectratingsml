It includes: (a) planning and implementing routine maintenance on about 4,400 miles of primary, secondary and subsidiary roads; (b) resealing of about 200 miles of paved roads; (c) rehabilitation of some 370 miles of gravel roads; and (d) consulting services and training. The project will benefit the rural and urban population by helping to lower transportation costs, improve accessibility to remote agricultural areas and increase availability of food. It will also help improve agricultural extension services and facilitate the distribution of farm inputs on a more extensive scale. Further expected benefits include savings from reduced road reconstruction costs and enhancement of institutional capacity to plan and execute road maintenance programs. The possible risks involved are mainly institutional. The successful implementation of the project depends on institutional improvements and the Government's ability to provide the necessary funds for maintenance operations. The risks are not unusual for this type of project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Sierra Leone!$!SL","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SL","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04298_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04298_1_0","DocDate":"07-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902371029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902371029","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912382429","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912382429","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Sierra Leone"}},"facets":{}}
