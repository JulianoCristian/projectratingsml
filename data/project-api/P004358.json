Major components include land reclamation of 1.6 ha, a 125 m berth, an extension of the present container freight station, and improvements to the port access road. Also included in the project area 30 m coastal berth at Samarai, located on a small island off the coast of Southern Papua, and consulting services for project design and implementation, and for training Papua New Guinea Harbours Board staff.
