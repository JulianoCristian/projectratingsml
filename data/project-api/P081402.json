The proposed operation would be the second in series of Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credits (PSACs). The proposed single-tranche PSAC continues the reform agenda initiated under the first PSAC (report no. P7439), approved by the Board of Directors in May 2001.The comprehensive decentralization reform program aims to adapt the existing institutional framework for improved decentralized public service delivery and governance to implement the Government's poverty reduction strategy. The PSAC program supports the Government in i t s efforts to improve the delivery of public services to the poor and increase the efficiency, transparency and accountability of Bolivia's decentralized government system. Bolivia has taken important steps, including those supported under the first PSAC, but important challenges remain. The present operation supports further deepening of the reform efforts, especially as regards issues of subnational finance and administration. The overall goals of the Government's decentralization reforms are to (i) improve the regulatory and institutional framework for decentralization; (ii) strengthen governance and enhance community participation; (iii) support fiscal discipline at the subnational level; and (iv) continue efforts to strengthen fiduciary management and institutional capacity of all levels of government. Specifically, this project aims to support the critical next steps for a system which has been declared decentralized but in reality remains only partially so. Some of these \"next steps\" include: (a) the transfer of limited local autonomy for tax policy to the municipalities; (b) clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the levels of the public sector in the importa"},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Power","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":16},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Capital markets"},{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"LD,FK,BC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,72,26,27,73","mjthemecode":"9,2,2,9,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":60},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050110094811","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050110094811","DocDate":"29-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202143156","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202143156","DocURL":"23-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202143156","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202143156","DocDate":"23-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20030527103605","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030527103605","DocDate":"19-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0212190407433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0212190407433","DocDate":"10-APR-2003"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
