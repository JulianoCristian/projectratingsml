The project would assist the Government in improving the policy framework for SSEs, through the establishment of a special regime for them in the investment code and improvement of the functioning of the Special Guarantee Fund. The project would also assist the Government in its review of Rwanda's import tariffs system for necessary changes. The project would provide for a line of credit of SDR 8.5 million equivalent to BRD, of which about SDR 4.7 million equivalent would be used for financing medium-sized and larger enterprises, and about SDR 3.8 million equivalent would be for SSE projects."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925232303","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925232303","DocDate":"09-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36ac6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36ac6_1_0","DocDate":"14-JAN-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36ac4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36ac4_1_0","DocDate":"14-JAN-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094320","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094320","DocDate":"30-NOV-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095501","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095501","DocDate":"30-NOV-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda"}},"facets":{}}
