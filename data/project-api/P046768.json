The project will: (1) implement and monitor environmentally sustainable community-managed forest resource systems, creating a protection zone around the Niokolo-Koba National Park; (2) promote inter-fuel substitution and improved stoves initiatives; (3) strengthen the institutions involved in managing the sector, and promote the participation of the civil society (private sector, academic institutions, and nongovernmental organizations (NGO)) in operating the sector. The project will finance: (1) an assessment of vegetation cover, an assessment of dead wood and other preparatory activities; (2) community-based forest management activities; (3) promotion of rural-based micro-enterprises and private sector and NGO-based inter-fuel substitution activities; (4) consultant services for supervision work, delivery of services, and various technical studies; (5) technical assistance; and (6) materials, equipment, and goods."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":87},"sector2":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":7},"sector3":{"Name":"Mining and other extractive","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Mining and other extractive"}],"docty":"Brief,Brief,Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"LB,LC,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"80,86,76,57","mjthemecode":"7,10,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Mining and other extractive","code":"LB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":87},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":7},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150218132645","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150218132645","DocDate":"09-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150218131921","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150218131921","DocDate":"09-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150218133352","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150218133352","DocDate":"09-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050622164157","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050622164157","DocDate":"20-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172354","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102320","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102320","DocDate":"23-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
