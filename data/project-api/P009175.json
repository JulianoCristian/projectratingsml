The project comprises the construction of about 1,000 km of single circuit transmission lines, 16 new substations and the extension of 8 existing substations with a total transformer capacity of about 10,000 MVA, 3 switching stations, and 9 dispatch centers (1 federal, 6 republican, and Kosovo). The project includes studies of management, tariffs, and system development. The 380-kV system coupled with adequate dispatch facilities is designed to allow for greater reliability, flexibility, and economy in supplying power throughout the country. The second phase (1977-82) of the 380-kV system is an extension and refinement of the basic power grid established under the first phase or first Power Transmission Project in 1972."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101442","DocDate":"28-DEC-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902280152","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902280152","DocDate":"30-JUN-1977"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
