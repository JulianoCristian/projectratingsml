More specifically, the RRSP II focuses on: (i) improving the efficiency of budget preparation and execution and increasing the professionalism and improving the human resource management of the civil service; and (ii) improving the investment climate through the reform of the revenue and private investment regimes. The grant is an integral part of International Development Association (IDA) Country Assistance Strategy for the period FY09-12 presented to the Board in April 2009 and is closely coordinated with assistance provided to support the program of Government's reforms through the ongoing Economic Governance and Institutional Reform Project, the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, the African Development Bank (AfDB) budget support operation and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Since Liberia is at high risk of debt distress, IDA resources are provided on grant terms, per the stipulations of the grant allocation system agreed with IDA donors for the IDA15 period. Liberia is also eligible for annual exceptional post-conflict allocations from IDA."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Liberia!$!LR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":10},"theme3":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":10},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":60},"totalcommamt":"4,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"LR","sectorcode":"YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"27,28,40,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,4,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":90},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20110215000608","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110215000608","DocDate":"15-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010060414525727","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010060414525727","DocDate":"09-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000020953_20090528105154","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20090528105154","DocDate":"28-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000013944_20090402111609","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000013944_20090402111609","DocDate":"04-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090210154518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090210154518","DocDate":"21-JAN-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Liberia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
