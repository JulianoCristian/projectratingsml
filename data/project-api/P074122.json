This program is one of the key pieces of the Government's poverty reduction strategy in the health sector, as it will prevent further groups from falling into poverty due to disabling diseases. The project has three main components beside project management. Component 1, strategic planning & institutional capacity building for HIV/AIDS/STIs control, finances activities to enhance Moldova's capacity in HIV/AIDS/STIs policy making and planning; and supports the CCM and HIV/AIDS National Program to review legislations and regulations related to HIV/AIDS/STIs and propose improvements. Selected operational research would be supported to provide the information base for better policies. The project supports the implementation of a second-generation surveillance system that monitors both HIV infection and risk behaviors (especially among injecting drug users (IDUs) and other highly vulnerable groups) to inform the trend of the epidemic; strengthens laboratory capacity; and provides training. Component 2, scaling up prevention interventions for HIV/AIDS/STIs and STI management, provides targeted interventions for vulnerable and highly vulnerable groups (young people, especially IDUs, commercial sex workers), men that have sex with men, prisoners, military and STIs clinic attendees); helps disseminate the protocol for mother-to-child transmission, supports universal voluntary counseling and testing at ante-natal clinics, and provides HIV-positive pregnant women with short courses of anti-retrovirals (ARV) and inf"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"5,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MD","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"88","mjthemecode":"8,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090601233743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090601233743","DocDate":"21-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052815170410","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052815170410","DocDate":"11-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20030521115838","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030521115838","DocDate":"14-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0210290402064","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0210290402064","DocDate":"25-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02091205205088","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02091205205088","DocDate":"05-SEP-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Moldova"}},"facets":{}}
