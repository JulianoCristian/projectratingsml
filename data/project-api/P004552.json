This project will constitute the first phase of a long term small coconut farms development program, which, over the next twenty years, will result in the replanting of some 743,000 ha of senile coconuts and the rehabilitation of 418,000 ha of low bearing palms.  Project objectives are to : a) launch a long term program of coconut replanting and productivity improvement; b) increase the incomes of coconut smallholders by improving coconut yields and copra quality; and c) boost foreign exchange earnings by ensuring an increasing and reliable supply of higher quality copra for processing and export.  Project components include : 1) establishment of seedgardens, nurseries and other infrastructure sufficient to sustain a long term program of replanting 50,000 ha of senile palms per annum; 2) replant 25,000 ha and support intercropping during the first 3 years of replanting; 3) rehabilitate 348,000 ha of middle aged palms and support the development of 50,000 ha of immature palms; 4) support a pilot copra quality improvement program; and 5) provide for the institutional strengthening of the Philippines Coconut Authority (PCA)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"121,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"AB,BC,AH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"75,45","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"5,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":85},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00071805314740","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00071805314740","DocDate":"06-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042913425138","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042913425138","DocDate":"29-MAR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041316163039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041316163039","DocDate":"04-JUN-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
