The main element of this water management project is to initiate a seven-year program to plan, implement and monitor improved operation and maintenance in selected irrigation schemes. Although focused on three states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu), this program also provides for smaller pilot efforts in other states. The principle components will be: 1) scheme investments including repairs, renovation, additional control structures, measuring devices and upgraded operation and maintenance facilities required to execute improved operational plans in up to 20 schemes with a total of almost 600,000 ha of irrigated area; 2) institutional strengthening; 3) scheme specific training programs; and, 4) special studies. The project will also include two other components related to the general objectives of improved water management in India. First, the Maharashtra Induction Training Program, which will provide training for engineers recruited into the Maharashtra Irrigation Department; and second, the Institutional Strengthening and Training Fund will finance studies, data collection and other preparation activities for possible future irrigation projects."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"114,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625093734","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625093734","DocDate":"10-JAN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36855_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36855_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36854_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36854_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36852_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36852_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091830","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091830","DocDate":"28-FEB-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.2","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926042449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926042449","DocDate":"20-FEB-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926042448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926042448","DocDate":"20-FEB-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.3","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926042451","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926042451","DocDate":"20-FEB-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
