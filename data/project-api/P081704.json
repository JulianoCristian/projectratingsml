The changes relate to a level two restructuring of the project that entails: (i) a six month extension of the project closing date from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013 to ensure both the adequate absorption of the implementation delays related to the suspension period and the effective coverage of the ongoing operational activities up to the effectiveness of the additional financing under preparation. During the suspension period Government of Mali (GoM) took concrete actions, including funding arrangements to secure the smooth continuation of the implementation activities. Therefore, the project continued to perform well, i.e. the construction program of the market oriented infrastructure which is critically important for the likely achievement of the project overall performance and its developmental outcomes, has been partially funded and is under implementation; (ii) a limited and slight reallocation of the credit proceeds to align project allocation of funds with the projected paths of activities and ensure that the desired outcomes will remain likely to be achieved. An effective enhancement of project's outcomes will be targeted through a well-balanced transfer of funds between categories to adequately cover those more in need of supplemental funds. The underlying rationale is that, during the extension period, the whole process will be fully funded from the available resources only, i.e. through: (a) the use of available GoM resources such as those of the guarantee funds and/or potential new GoM resources allocations; (b) any possible cost reductions as made possible by the evolving project context; and (c) a to be made, available
