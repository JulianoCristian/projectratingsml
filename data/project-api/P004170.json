The project consists of three parts.  The first is an approximately 1000 km pipeline system to transport petroleum products.  The network will include an east-north trunkline connecting two eastern refineries near Pusan to Taejon; a west-north trunkline connecting the Honam refinery at Yeochon to Taejon; and two parallel pipelines from Taejon to Seoul. The system also includes two short segments, as well as storage tanks, pumping stations and loading and unloading facilities.  The system is designed to initially transport about 500,000 barrels per day of clean projects or about 55% of the total oil consumed domestically.  The second part is a major study on energy conservation, including preparation of an action plan for subsequent implementation by the government.  The third includes technical assistance to the Dae Han Oil Pipeline Corporation (DHOPC), which involves training DHOPC staff in the critical areas of operations, finance and management and helping to design and implement DHOPC's management information system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,84,81","mjthemecode":"11,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122584842","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122584842","DocURL":"30-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2010031610124941","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031610124941","DocURL":"30-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122584842","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122584842","DocDate":"30-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004072714","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004072714","DocDate":"12-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004072905","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004072905","DocDate":"12-MAY-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
