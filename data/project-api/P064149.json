There are five main project components. The first provides technical assistance to implement the privatization and regulation program supported by the FCC. It supports the Privatization Commission, revamps the legal and regulatory framework, privatizes the management of the state-owned electricity company, funds follow-up activities to the privatization of the state petroleum company, and privatizes the state telecommunications company. The second component furnishes technical assistance to help prepare the poverty reduction strategy which includes updating the poverty note as well as diagnostic studies on public health, education, rural transportation, the cotton sector, the livestock sector, forestry, and mining. The third component supports the technical committee for structural adjustment (CTP-PAS). The fourth component supplies technical assistance to start implementing the statistical development plan. The fifth component strengthens the mining ministry."},"country_namecode":"Central African Republic!$!CF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Power","Percent":6},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CF","sectorcode":"CT,BG,LD,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Economic management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"22,27,40,53","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"6,4,2,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","code":"22"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":86},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":6},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050614161856","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050614161856","DocDate":"23-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201130595","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201130595","DocURL":"10-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201130595","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201130595","DocDate":"10-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00051305470261","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051305470261","DocDate":"02-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99111305451748","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99111305451748","DocDate":"02-MAY-2000"}],"countryname":"Central African Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
