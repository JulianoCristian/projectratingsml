Project components: Component 1) will promote high-quality relevant, secondary education by supporting measures to improve learning in core subjects, teaching-learning environments, and the relevance of technical education through stronger linkages with tertiary education and the private sector. Component 2) will promote broad-based coverage in secondary education by supporting three key strategies: (a) the development of flexible delivery models; (b) the development of a new demand-side subsidy scheme; and (c) where needed, the expansion and rehabilitation of public infrastructure. Component 3) will enhance the effectiveness of all the project's interventions by developing solid evaluation, certification and accreditation systems, and by improving school management and
