There are three main project components. The first supports the rapid privatization of about 27 important firms through internationally accepted methods, using best practices that ensure transparency, competitive tendering, and appropriate sales techniques for the companies being privatized. The second component strengthens the capacity of the Republic of Serbia Agency for Privatization to undertake a complex privatization program using best practices. the third component supports foreign investment and the deregulation of the business environment by strengthening the institutional capacity of the Republic of Agencies for Foreign Investment, for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Development, and the SME Department of the Ministry of Economy and Privatization, which will supervise the implementation of the new liberalized policies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Serbia!$!YF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"YF","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"34,40,41,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,4,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050627111053","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050627111053","DocDate":"25-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061513571273","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061513571273","DocDate":"18-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042309413374","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042309413374","DocDate":"19-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061513554064","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061513554064","DocDate":"01-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061513531559","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061513531559","DocDate":"14-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051410172025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051410172025","DocDate":"23-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01072604030541","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072604030541","DocDate":"28-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01051804022927","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01051804022927","DocDate":"09-MAY-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Serbia"}},"facets":{}}
