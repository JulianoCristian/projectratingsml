There are three components in this project.  First, agricultural research management will assist in operationalizing the Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization (EARO); designing and implementing a decentralized research system; implementing new systems and procedures for efficient agricultural research management; and developing a strong program of research-extension-farmer linkages.  Second, strengthening of the agricultural research system will rehabilitate and expand the existing research system to make its operation more efficient and its work environment more conducive to research work.  Third, human resource development will provide technical assistance and training for the researchers in the research system and those at the AUA."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":63},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":37},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"AB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"26,78,79,77","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,10,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":63},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":37}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080402011336","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080402011336","DocDate":"20-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000160016_20031118112104","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20031118112104","DocDate":"10-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121314836","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121314836","DocURL":"07-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121314836","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121314836","DocDate":"07-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980625102055","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980625102055","DocDate":"08-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903310880","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903310880","DocDate":"18-AUG-1997"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
