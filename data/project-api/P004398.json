The project has four main components. The first develops and implements a process whereby landowners will become more aware of options in using their forests. Its three sub-components comprise consultative activities to improve landowner access to information and discussions of development options prior to any land-use decisions; improved processes and systems for landowner representation and organization to allow improved resource decisionmaking will be developed and implemented; and policy and legislative development. The second component establishes a Conservation Trust Fund with GEF support, and develops a co-financing strategy. The third component augments the efforts of the forest authority and other institutions involved in sustainable management of the country's forests. It improves capacity specifically by improving forest operations, inspection, and monitoring; forest management planning; and expanding activities that maintain forest production as well as ecological potential. The fourth component provides technical assistance for environmental assessment and monitoring while building apacity within the Office of Environment and Conservation."},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine!$!PG","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":37},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":21},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rule of law","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"17,360,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PG","sectorcode":"BC,JB,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"80,37,82,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,3,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other rule of law","code":"37"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":42},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":37},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":21}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000090341_20061122103441","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061122103441","DocDate":"13-OCT-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041315353278","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041315353278","DocDate":"20-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060111541276","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060111541276","DocDate":"20-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060111490577","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060111490577","DocDate":"20-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000112742_20041201154542","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20041201154542","DocDate":"16-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101716","DocDate":"29-MAY-2001"}],"countryname":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine"}},"facets":{}}
