As such, the project will help the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) to: 1) move toward a fully commercial operation under the new organization, as well as continue previous efforts to strengthen its institutional capacity to apply safety and environmental standards and conduct project analyses including investment programming and 2) construct a pipeline for transporting domestic gas.  The project components include: 1) a comprehensive study regarding PTT corporate strategy, organizational effectiveness, and ownership structure; 2) institutional building and training of PTT staff; 3) a 36-inch diameter, 425 km offshore gas transmission pipeline that extends from an existing platform at the Erawan fields in the  Gulf of Thailand to onshore receiving facilities at Rayong; 4) a 28-inch diameter, 110 km onshore pipeline that extends from Rayong to an area near the EGAT power plant at Bang Pakong; 5) related facilities, including a compressor station, metering stations, gas processing facilities, and telecommunications and control systems; and 6) project engineering and management consultancy services."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"155,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,39,84","mjthemecode":"11,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123061339","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123061339","DocURL":"27-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123061138","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123061138","DocURL":"27-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123061138","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123061138","DocDate":"27-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d17_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d17_1_0","DocDate":"22-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d16_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d16_1_0","DocDate":"22-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005202920","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005202920","DocDate":"30-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005202627","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005202627","DocDate":"30-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970716150317","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716150317","DocDate":"31-JUL-1993"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
