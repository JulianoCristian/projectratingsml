The closing date for project will be extended from September 15, 2010 until December 15, 2010. In a letter dated July 23, 2010, the Government of Malawi requested an extension of the project until November 15, 2010. Finally, the team confirms that the requirements of Operation Policy/Bank Policy (OP/BP) 13.30 (closing dates) relating to the extension of closing dates have been met. Specifically, as required under the OP: (i) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii) the performance of the borrower and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; and (iii) the borrower has prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the project. The extension is necessary to ensure that all civil works and a few procurement cases can be finalized. A realistic and comprehensive action place is currently in place to ensure all needed work is completed by the December 15, 2010 closing date."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
