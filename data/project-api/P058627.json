The project consists of four components. 1) Strengthening Service Delivery will improve access, quality, and efficiency of district-based primary health care services; improve financial viability of secondary and tertiary referral hospital services to support primary level curative services; and promote private sector involvement in delivery of health services. 2) Strengthening the MOH and Central Support Systems will strengthen Ministry of Health's (MOH) capacity and systems for policy development, analysis and national planning, development of guidelines for national policy implementation, performance monitoring and evaluation, and development and enforcement of legislation. This component will also strengthen the national support systems for drugs and medical supplies, physical infrastructure, and health management information system. It will also develop human resources to implement health reforms effectively. 3) Health Financing will broaden financing options and improve financial management for increased financial self-sufficiency and sustainability. 4) National HIV/AIDS Fund will intensify national effort to prevent HIV infection and mitigate the adverse effects of AIDS in a multi-sectoral manner."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":82},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":11},"sector3":{"Name":"Central
