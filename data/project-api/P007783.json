The project focuses primarily on pre-primary and primary education where the vast majority of students come from poor segments of the population. The project will achieve its goal by the decentralization of educational management; development and distribution of educational materials, especially textbooks; expansion and improvement of non-formal pre-primary education; and rehabilitation, replacement, and repair of inadequate school plants."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Nicaragua!$!NI","sector1":{"Name":"Primary
