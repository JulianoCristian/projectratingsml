Phase I will focus on building the institutional and technical capacities needed to support the generation and adoption of efficient cropping and post-harvest technologies and hence launch the intensification process. Phase I includes seven components: The first component will empower beneficiary farmers to efficiently manage marshland/hill-side cropping and livestock activities and promote the adoption of improved soil, water and, fertility conservation techniques; and private operators to intervene in land and water infrastructure construction and maintenance. The integrated management of critical ecosystems component will strengthen the capacity of local communities to effectively manage critical ecosystems. The promotion of commercial and export agriculture component will develop export crop agriculture through facilitation of access to investment capital and strengthening of capacities of farmers and exporters. The fourth component will strengthen the capacities of agricultural research and extension systems. The fifth component will strengthen the capacities of local communities, private sector operators, farmers and other private sector operators, and water management infrastructure to develop small-scale infrastructure. The sixth component will lead to higher levels of off-farm employment and incomes. The last component will support project coordination."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":23},"theme5":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"48,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"TZ,WZ,BZ,YA,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Rural development","Rural development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,45,78,76,48","mjthemecode":"5,10,10,5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":40},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":11},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20090219092657","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090219092657","DocDate":"22-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0009270533079","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0009270533079","DocDate":"02-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01032905304481","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032905304481","DocDate":"01-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000160016_20030827142956","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030827142956","DocDate":"27-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00110406043769","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00110406043769","DocDate":"18-NOV-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda"}},"facets":{}}
