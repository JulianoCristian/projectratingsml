The principle elements of the project include: 1) establishment of a Council of Agricultural Research Policy (CARP) with appropriate authority to formulate, through a National Agricultural Research Plan, an overall strategy for research.  The Council's further responsibility is to set national research policy and priorities for allocation of resources, and recommend allocation of funds for phased implementation of research programs.  In addition to the above, the project involves 2) provision of infrastructure, equipment, machinery and vehicles at research institutions; 3) introduction of a contract research program; 4) staff development and technical assistance; 5) establishment of a research planning cell and project management unit; and 6) strengthening of research extension linkages.  Lastly, the project entails 7) incremental staff and operating costs."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":58},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"18,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"51,78","mjthemecode":"10,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":42},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":58}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970909142440","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970909142440","DocDate":"11-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36870_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36870_1_0","DocDate":"07-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091919","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091919","DocDate":"31-MAR-1987"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
