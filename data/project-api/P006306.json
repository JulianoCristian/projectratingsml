It includes the connection of about 35,000 new low-income urban consumers. CEEE's overall program, of which the project forms a part, will provide the facilities required to serve the expected loads in CEEE's service area, mostly related to industrial growth. The program will also make public service electricity available to about 12 new rural consumers. The project includes the following: construction of about 90 circuit-km of subtransmission lines at 138 kV, and about 550 circuit-km at 69 kV, and installation of about 1,000 MVA of additional transformer capacity; construction of about 800 circuit-km of distribution lines at 23 kV and 13.8 kV, about 6,000 circuit-km of low voltage lines, and installation of about 300 MVA of additional transformer capacity and about 580,000 meters, for the connection of about 325,000 new consumers; study on conversion of rice irrigation pumping throughout the State of Rio Grande do Sul from direct diesel drive to electric drive; and about 300 man-months of consultants' services for a program to improve CEEE's operations."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"114,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924225906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924225906","DocDate":"20-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191248018","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191248018","DocDate":"31-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902344549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902344549","DocDate":"31-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e9614e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9614e_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9614c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9614c_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e9614b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9614b_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1980"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
