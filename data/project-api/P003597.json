It will also improve the quantity and quality of raw water for the Shanghai City water supply, and expand and improve inland waterway transportation.  Flood control and land drainage will be effected through river channelization of the Wangyu and Taipu Rivers to evacuate flood water to the Yangtze River, flood diversion through the Hang-Jia-Hu river system to Hangzhou Bay, and increased flood regulation in Tai Lake through strengthening and upgrading of the lake's perimeter dikes. The enlarged Wangyu River channel will be used to divert water from the Yangtze River to augment water supply in the basin during dry seasons.  Inland waterway transportation will be improved through more stable and controlled water levels and additional shiplocks constructed in rivers and canals. Institutional capability will be strengthened through better facilities for flood monitoring and forecasting, communication, staff training, technical assistance, and equipment."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
