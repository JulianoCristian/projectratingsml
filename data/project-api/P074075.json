It also includes women's development capacity, to allow them partake in the participatory planning process. The integrated natural resource management will focus on: water harvesting, and watershed management, through underground cisterns/reservoirs, dykes of water and soil retention, and, implementation of sustainable watershed management plans; develop a strategy for sustained use of communal resources, managing vegetation together with animals; and, integrate biodiversity conservation, through education, awareness, and capacity building, introducing alternative fuel sources. The development of productive activities comprises an extension outreach, and adaptive research for livestock, crop, and horticulture production, as well as off-farm productive activities, to diversify rural household incomes. The rural roads component will prod the possibility for further sources of income, while the revolving fund, and rural micro-finance component will support the establishment of professional credit retailers in the project area.
