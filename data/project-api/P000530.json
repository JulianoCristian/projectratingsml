To achieve the objectives, the project will implement:  (i) the consolidation agenda to ensure that the positive achievements under the Transport Sector Adjustment/Investment Program (TSAIP) are maintained; (ii) the continuing agenda of sectoral objectives that were only partially met under TSAIP and; (iii) the evolving agenda to address long-term issues of sustainability critical to the transport sector program. The project will support these agendas through a set of policy measures largely met through up-front conditionalities and investment components.  The physical works component consists of:  (1) a program of road routine and periodic maintenance and bridge strengthening on the existing priority network of 4,760 km; and (2) a program of about 300 km of secondary roads crucial for the linkage between regions of agricultural potential and main consumption centers.  The program of institutional strengthening comprises: (a) consulting services for civil works design and supervision, soil research studies and testing, and technical and financial audits; (b) consulting services to promote private entrepreneurship for small and medium construction co"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":71},"sector2":{"Name":"Aviation","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"37,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Aviation"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TD","sectorcode":"BC,TV,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"33,39,25,47","mjthemecode":"5,2,4,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Aviation","code":"TV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":71},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0102240537372","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0102240537372","DocDate":"19-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961007082941","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007082941","DocDate":"07-OCT-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121180381","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121180381","DocURL":"21-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121180482","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121180482","DocDate":"21-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121180381","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121180381","DocDate":"21-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121180482","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121180482","DocURL":"21-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e12623_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e12623_1_0","DocDate":"22-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e12622_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e12622_1_0","DocDate":"22-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004191918","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004191918","DocDate":"03-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004191434","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004191434","DocDate":"03-JUN-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chad"}},"facets":{}}
