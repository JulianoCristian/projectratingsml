The credit will allow more private sector initiatives not only in the financial sector but in the industrial and other productive sectors. The principal project objectives are : 1) support of SMEs through technical assistance and support of the government's ongoing restructuring efforts of the economy; 2) improving financial sector efficiency through resource mobilization, improved allocation, and interest rate liberalization; 3) strengthening institutions operating in the financial and SME support sector; 4) generating new employment opportunities. The project is comprised of the following components : 1) investment of US$45 million to finance projects in productive sectors promoted by private enterprises; 2) technical assistance to support SME development, staff training, strengthening of Central Bank supervision and monetary management capacities; and 3) establishment of policy conditions concerning the financial sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Mining and
