The specific objectives are to: (a) redefine Government's role in groundwater development and provide assistance to facilitate change; (b) develop a monitoring program and regulatory framework to ensure sustainable use of the groundwater resources; (c) develop sustainable farmers' organizations; (d) increase beneficiaries' incomes and alleviate poverty; (e) rationalize public expenditure on operation and management of the irrigation and drainage systems as well as increase the recovery of public expenditures on irrigation infrastructure; and (f) avoid environmental hazard of saline water intrusion into fresh groundwater aquifers. The project covering a large part of fresh groundwater Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP) areas in Punjab will be implemented over a period of five years. The major components are: (a) disinvestment of SCARP tubewells; (b) development of a groundwater monitoring and regulatory framework; (c) improvement of irrigation conveyance facilities; (d) prevention of saline groundwater intrusion in fresh aquifers; (e) monitoring and evaluation of the project; and (f) project management, and technical assistance and training."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":6},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"56,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"BG,BH,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,78,82,57,77","mjthemecode":"10,7,11,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02062704070111","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02062704070111","DocDate":"10-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123413596","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123413596","DocURL":"19-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123413596","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123413596","DocDate":"19-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123413395","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123413395","DocURL":"19-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123413395","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123413395","DocDate":"19-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214121406","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214121406","DocDate":"13-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980901093339","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980901093339","DocDate":"11-AUG-1994"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
