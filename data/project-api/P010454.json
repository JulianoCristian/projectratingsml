It finances activities designed to: (a) assist institutional development, decentralization of management authority and strengthening of campus-level management; (b) improve selected facilities at three key campuses; (c) improve instructional delivery and rationalize the centralized student examination system; (d) assist the Ministry of Education and Culture to prepare for higher secondary education reform; and (e) develop TU's maintenance capacity.  Facilities development will give priority to upgrading laboratories and library resource centers plus the rehabilitation of existing facilities at the main Kirtipur campus, and two other lead campuses expected to become the nuclei of regional universities in the future."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":89},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":7},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NP","sectorcode":"BC,ES,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,66,25","mjthemecode":"2,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":89},{"Name":"Education","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02070904045140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02070904045140","DocDate":"19-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123323118","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123323118","DocURL":"16-FEB-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123323118","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123323118","DocDate":"16-FEB-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b31a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b31a_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004205040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004205040","DocDate":"23-NOV-1993"}],"countryname":"Nepal"}},"facets":{}}
