The project consists of three parts:  (i) development of six pilot projects, of about 4,000 ha each, introducing technical packages for annual and perennial crops and livestock; (ii) improvement and expansion of agricultural and livestock extension programs in the humid tropics, with emphasis on the areas of influence of the pilot projects; and (iii) support for the tropical agricultural and livestock research programs.  The technical, social, and administrative packages developed as a result of the project would be applicable to a wider area of about 660,000 ha having similar ecological and socio-economic conditions.  The proposed pilot projects would directly benefit about 3,000 smallholders and cooperative farmers, the majority of which have incomes below the relative poverty level in Mexico."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"56,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000333038_20090202042933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090202042933","DocDate":"27-DEC-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912374766","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912374766","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902303149","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902303149","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c59_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c59_1_0","DocDate":"27-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c57_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c57_1_0","DocDate":"27-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c56_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c56_1_0","DocDate":"27-APR-1978"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
