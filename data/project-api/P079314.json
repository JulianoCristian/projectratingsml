The Second Moldova Social Investment Fund Project (MSIF II) demonstrates good implementation progress. After having completed the implementation program for the original credit MSIF has disbursed about 80 percent of the (first) additional financing credit and fully committed the part of the credit allocated for subprojects. Implementation of the most recent second additional financing credit of USD20 million has reached a very intense phase. The restructuring is undertaken to amend the provisions in the financing agreement for credit to allow utilization of the Government of Moldova (GoM) list of schools that will not be closed under the schools optimization program as a basis for investing the credit proceeds in school-related subprojects."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"Other social
