Specifically, it will support the government's actions to:  (a) implement the agreed program of financial and trade reforms; (b) promote, encourage and facilitate voluntary lending by commercial banks to the agricultural sector without incurring a significant decline in lending resources; (c) monitor and analyze agricultural credit demand and supply, and recommend measures to ensure a smooth transition to market-based credit system, including the phasing out of forced investments; and (d) transform Caja Agraria, the largest bank serving the rural sector, into an efficient rural financial institution.  The project will provide US$250 million of loan funds to the Fund for Financing the Agricultural Sector to be used to rediscount medium- and long-term loans to finance on-farm investments, agroindustry and related working capital.  The project will also help ensure the implementation of Caja Agraria's Corporate Plan aimed at restructuring, rationalizing and recapitalizing the institution."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development"],"themecode":"75","mjthemecode":"10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3961214174635","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214174635","DocDate":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122572289","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122572289","DocURL":"13-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122572289","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122572289","DocDate":"13-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122572188","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122572188","DocURL":"13-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122572188","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122572188","DocDate":"13-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003031425","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003031425","DocDate":"25-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003031250","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003031250","DocDate":"25-FEB-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
