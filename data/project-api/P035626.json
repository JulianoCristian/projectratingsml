There are four project components. First, capacity strengthening of key stakeholders is to reinforce the capacity of the government sector (state and municipal governments) and non-governmental sector (nongovernmental organizations and local consulting firms) to prepare and evaluate the various TIPPEE (labor-based public works to be contracted out to small- and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs]) operations. This component will provide training to key stakeholders for the use of such a methodology. Second, pilot community-based infrastructure schemes will provide a test for the TIPPEE approach in four under-serviced neighborhoods in Libreville, Port-Gentil, and Franceville. It will include road paving, preparation of community-based development plans, and developing neighborhood amenities. Third, project monitoring and evaluation will develop an evaluation methodology for assessing socio-economic and environmental impacts and a management system for the TIPPEE contracts. Fourth, support for a longer-term program of institutional reforms will prepare the institutional framework for sustained development of local SME firms specializing in construction and public works."},"country_namecode":"Gabonese Republic!$!GA","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":64},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":13},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":6},"sector5":{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":11},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"GA","sectorcode":"YY,WA,BZ,JB,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"39,40,53,71,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,9,6,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Other domestic and international trade","code":"YY"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":64},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":13},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":6},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050103115648","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050103115648","DocDate":"23-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031815283433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031815283433","DocDate":"27-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173611","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173611","DocDate":"11-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980928162420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980928162420","DocDate":"28-JUL-1998"}],"countryname":"Gabonese Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
