The proposed project would provide for increased agricultural and livestock production through minor irrigation development, strengthening of agricultural extension and animal health services, training, and improved availability of farm inputs. These directly productive investments would be complemented by investments in erosion control, health care, village water supplies, lower and upper secondary education, postal services, panchayat facilities, and trails and foot-bridges. The project also provides for a study of cottage industry potential and prospects."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"NP","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902331970","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902331970","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd089_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd089_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1979"}],"countryname":"Nepal"}},"facets":{}}
