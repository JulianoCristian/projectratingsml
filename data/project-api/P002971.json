The project is designed to support the Government's strategy of decentralizing health services. It plans to increase the efficiency of the existing health infrastructure and institutions through consolidation and improved management with increased local accountability, while simultaneously supporting cost recovery and budgetary policies that will enable the health care system to move toward long term sustainability. It supports the Government's efforts to reorder priorities within the exisitng health care system through efficiency improvements and by reallocating financial and human resources toward ensuring the provision of a package of essential health services for all Uganda's citizens. Accordingly, the proposed project will: 1) pilot and test new sector policies and strategies which will facilitate the implementation of essential health services; 2) strengthen management and planning capacity at district levels so that they are prepared to provide essential health services; and 3) restructure the Ministry of Health so as to build its capacity to provide health policy leadership and to support the Government's decentralization policy."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":2},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"BC,BK,BH,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Public sector governance","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"67,26,69,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20060502093247","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060502093247","DocDate":"03-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030630112255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030630112255","DocDate":"23-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121251525","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121251525","DocURL":"19-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121251525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121251525","DocDate":"19-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121251726","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121251726","DocDate":"19-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b46f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b46f_1_0","DocDate":"07-FEB-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007040244","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007040244","DocDate":"28-DEC-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
