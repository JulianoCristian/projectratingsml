Revenue performance will be improved and domestic resources increased on a sustainable basis to finance budgetary needs, through the support of the Tax Administration Project. The main components will: a) improve the legal system to enact laws and regulations in taxation, and will introduce regulatory taxpayer frameworks, to further establish appeals mechanisms; b) increase the number of registered taxpayers contributing to a broadened tax base, thus creating a rationalization for deductions, exemptions and concessions granted by tax laws, to further identify sources of revenue for tax base expansion; c) strengthen the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), through a re-engineering process, computerization of three revenue departments, and improve the tax arrears recovery and the control of tax evasion; d) improve the administrative infrastructure, with the rehabilitation/construction of needed facilities; and, e) include a Project Preparation Facility to finance project coordination and implementation."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Brief,Brief,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rule of law"],"themecode":"33,28","mjthemecode":"2,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070718091728","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070718091728","DocDate":"29-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333037_20150218114931","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20150218114931","DocDate":"26-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333037_20150218115528","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20150218115528","DocDate":"26-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123531465","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123531465","DocURL":"04-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123531465","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123531465","DocDate":"04-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99081506043185","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99081506043185","DocDate":"31-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9903250555112","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903250555112","DocDate":"11-MAR-1999"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
