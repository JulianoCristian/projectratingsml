The FMCDPL series, along with parallel DPL in the areas of social policy and environment, were designed in close partnership with Government of Peru (GoP) and in line with its policy program, as outlined in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The GoP stated a clear vision for: (i) building on recent economic successes to achieve higher growth and better social outcomes; (ii) constructing a better social contract between the government and citizens based on effective social development; and (iii) modernizing state institutions. This FMCDPL programmatic series has been prepared at the request of President Garcia's administration. It has been designed to support Peru's own program. Unlike the previous two loans in the series, this third operation includes policies to deal with short-term issues such the effects of the global crisis, while maintaining momentum in the implementation of reforms that address structural issues and which will have medium-term effects. The operation supports the GoP efforts in the context of a global economic slowdown. The development objective of the loan is to contribute to growth and poverty alleviation by supporting two main policy areas: (a) quality of fiscal management; and (b) competitiveness. Peru entered the global crisis in a solid position and has managed its challenges well. Good macroeconomic fundamentals and appropriate policy responses to the crisis moderate the negative impact of weaker external demand and external shocks. Aware of the downside risks to economic growth as well to poverty and employment, the GoP has implemented counter-cyclical policies to mitigate the impact of the crisis. Nonetheless, the GoP has not lost sight of the medium-term objectives of its reform a"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"SME Finance","Percent":13},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":12},"theme3":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":12},"theme4":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"SME Finance"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade"},{"Name":"Capital markets"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"FK,YY,JB,FH,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Economic management","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"27,23,87,28,49","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"5,2,6,1,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"SME Finance","code":"FH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Other domestic and international trade","code":"YY"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":13},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":13},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":12},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20120719014828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120719014828","DocDate":"01-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022319202640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022319202640","DocDate":"23-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20091022234716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091022234716","DocDate":"24-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090928110030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090928110030","DocDate":"13-AUG-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
