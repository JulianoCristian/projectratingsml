Important subsidiary goals are to improve the business environment for industry and commerce generally. The projected is divided into three broad components. The first, product and market development support, emphasizes entrepreneur capacity building and promoting markets in export support services. It consists of administration and advisory services as well as funding to operate a matching grant facility and smaller subprojects to strengthen selected public, private, and public/private support service providers not amenable to matching grants. The second component, trade management capacity building, focuses on key aspects of the policy and institutional environment for export and other business. It includes more rapid clearance for exports and their imported inputs, better bonded warehousing and duty drawback schemes, a management information system, the piloting of modern auditing and risk management methods, taxpayer education, and staff training. Another subproject strengthens capacity in the tariff commission for trade data and protection policy analysis and in the commerce ministry for international and regional trade cooperation. A coordination and development unit will undertake analysis of export constraints and institutional change needs."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"theme1":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"45,39,28,44,29","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,4,2,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":55},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050510141547","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050510141547","DocDate":"15-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201064318","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201064318","DocURL":"01-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201064318","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201064318","DocDate":"01-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99052707174324","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99052707174324","DocDate":"10-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101820","DocDate":"23-DEC-1997"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
