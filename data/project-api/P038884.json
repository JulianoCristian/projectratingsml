The project will ensure that funds are targeted and reliability transferred to the poorest communities, and would promote further decentralization of decision making to State, municipal and local levels. The project comprises the following three components: community subprojects including infrastructure, social and small-scale productive industrial projects; institutional development providing all implementing communities with technical assistance and training for project implementation; and administration, monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of
