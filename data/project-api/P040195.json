The specific academic programs to be supported will be determined through a competitive process.  The recipient academic programs will utilize block grant funds to implement self-design development plans aimed at improving educational quality.  The components of the project are the following: 1) improvement of educational quality through competitive grants to undergraduate study programs in public and private universities; 2) improvement of discipline service centers through direct investment and performance-based awards; and 3) support to the Central Project Coordinating Unit (CPCU)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":88},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"71,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48,66","mjthemecode":"8,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":88},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050217111943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050217111943","DocDate":"30-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172419","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040516275711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040516275711","DocDate":"04-AUG-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102531","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102531","DocDate":"21-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
