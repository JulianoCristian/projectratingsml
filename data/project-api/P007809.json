It represents the least-cost alternative to supplying new customers and rehabilitating obsolete distribution and subtransmission facilities. The project would include 38 specific subprojects which would be executed during 1980-83 and the routine distribution expansion required to connect new consumers in 1981-82. In addition, the project would include technical services to strengthen IRHE's planning and design of distribution and subtransmission works. Specifically, the project would consist of: (a) rehabilitation and construction of about 535 circuit km of lines; (b) installation of about 135 MVA of transformers in existing substations and in new substations to be constructed; (c) installation of accessory subtransmission equipment; (d) construction of about 100 circuit km of lines and 260 km of distribution networks; (e) installation of about 3,300 distribution transformers with a total capacity of about 100 MVA; (f) installation of accessory distribution equipment; and (g) consulting services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Panama!$!PA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"23,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PA","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925090416","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925090416","DocDate":"24-NOV-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e958cd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958cd_1_0","DocDate":"13-DEC-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e958cc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958cc_1_0","DocDate":"13-DEC-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902334731","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902334731","DocDate":"30-NOV-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912472245","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912472245","DocDate":"30-NOV-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Panama"}},"facets":{}}
