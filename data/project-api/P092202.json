The closing date for the project will be extended from June 30, 2011 until June 29, 2012. The extension is necessary to compensate partially for the delay in effectiveness. It will ensure that the Government of El Salvador has adequate time to complete some activities that are essential for the achievement of the project objective, in particular: i) supervision of key field activities (surveying, delimitation and demarcation of the pilot areas) currently financed with counterpart funds; (ii) completion of productive subprojects that benefit the pilot areas' residents and are a tool to mitigate the negative impact stemming from restriction of access to resources; (iii) a follow-up legal consultancy for a proposal of Protected Areas Law regulations; (iv) update of participatory management plans for the two pilot areas; and (v) an updated strategy and action plan for the consolidation of a sustainable National Protected Areas System. An action plan for implementing these activities has been agreed by the Recipient, and it is attached to the Government's request letter. This will be the first extension of the project closing date."},"country_namecode":"Republic of El
