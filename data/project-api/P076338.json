The restructuring and project extension are due primarily to delays in the signing of the contract for the development of the integrated data processing system. The $4 million contract ultimately became effective in July 2010 and is estimated to take 25 months to complete. The project closing date was previously extended by one year to December 31, 2010. Other project activities are on track for completion by the end of 2010 and it has been agreed with the client that this second extension will only include activities relating to the development of the data processing system. The extension will constitute the second extension of the closing date. The extension has been discussed with the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine (MoF), and it was agreed that the extension will solely include activities related to the development of the Information and Communication System (ICT) system."},"country_namecode":"Ukraine!$!UA","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Economic statistics, modeling and
