Within this context the project is composed of two major components. The first one involves rehabilitating primary education with limited increases in recurrent public expenditure by: assisting local community initiatives through the provision of financial and technical support for the reconstruction and/or rehabilitation and equipping of about 1000 existing classrooms; and by improving the efficiency and quality of schooling through the provision of low-cost books and teacher guides; the training of supplementary teachers; and strengthening of teacher supervision and support. The second component involves the rehabilitation of sector management and planning capacity by; strengthening the Ministry of National Education's (MEN) capacities to plan and manage it's resources; and strengening MEN's capacity to manage and implement projects through continued support to the recently established National Directorate for Education Projects."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Education adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"22,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Education adjustment"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TD","sectorcode":"EE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Education adjustment","code":"EE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008065130","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008065130","DocDate":"28-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120411335","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120411335","DocDate":"25-AUG-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120411335","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120411335","DocURL":"25-AUG-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0834d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0834d_1_0","DocDate":"02-AUG-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927010421","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927010421","DocDate":"14-JUL-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927010550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927010550","DocDate":"14-JUL-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100430001612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100430001612","DocDate":"14-JUL-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chad"}},"facets":{}}
