This program document is the First Economic Governance Reform Grant to the Republic of The Gambia in the amount of SDR 3.9 million (US$6.0 million equivalent). The grant is the first in a series of two such Development Policy Grants (DPGs) covering the period 2012 to 2013. It will support the implementation of the country's Program for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE), which aims at improving the living conditions of the Gambian population by implementing cross-cutting reforms to diversify the economy and thereby reduce its vulnerability to external shocks. It is organized around the five pillar of the new development strategy: (i) accelerating and sustaining economic growth; (ii) improving and modernizing infrastructure; (iii) strengthening human capital stock and enhancing access to social services; (iv) improving governance and increasing economic competitiveness; and (v) reinforcing social cohesion. Therefore, the program document for this operation is being presented alongside the joint staff advisory note on the program for accelerated growth and employment. The grant will also provide urgently-needed assistance to deal with the recently-announced crop failure. Along with the rest of the Sahelian countries of West Africa, The Gambia has suffered from inadequate and erratic rainfall in 2011. The full impact is now becoming apparent and the government has officially requested emergency assistance from the international community."},"country_namecode":"Republic of The Gambia!$!GM","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>GM \u2013 Appui budg\u00e9taire \u2013 PPD</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le principal objectif du Premier programme de don \u00e0 l\u2019appui des r\u00e9formes de la gouvernance \u00e9conomique pour la Gambie est de renforcer la transparence, la responsabilisation et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de la gestion des finances publiques afin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la gestion publique dans les secteurs de l\u2019agriculture, de l\u2019\u00e9ducation et de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et de promouvoir la concurrence dans le secteur des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications. Ce document du programme concerne le premier don \u00e0 l\u2019appui des r\u00e9formes de la gouvernance \u00e9conomique de la R\u00e9publique de Gambie d\u2019un montant de 3,9\u00a0millions de DTS (\u00e9quivalant \u00e0 6\u00a0millions USD). Le don est le premier d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de deux dons pour la politique de d\u00e9veloppement couvrant la p\u00e9riode de 2012 \u00e0 2013. Il financera la mise en \u0153uvre du Programme national en faveur de l'acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration de la croissance et de l\u2019emploi qui vise \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie de la population gambienne par l'application de r\u00e9formes intersectorielles afin de diversifier l\u2019\u00e9conomie et ainsi r\u00e9duire sa vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 aux chocs externes. Il s\u2019articule autour des cinq piliers de la nouvelle strat\u00e9gie de d\u00e9veloppement: (i) acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer et viabiliser la croissance \u00e9conomique; (ii) am\u00e9liorer et moderniser les infrastructures\u00a0; (iii) renforcer le stock de capital humain et am\u00e9liorer l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services sociaux\u00a0; (iv) am\u00e9liorer la gouvernance et augmenter la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique\u00a0; et (v) renforcer la coh\u00e9sion sociale. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle ce document de programme est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour cette op\u00e9ration conjointement avec la note d'orientation du personnel sur le programme d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration de la croissance et de l\u2019emploi. Ce don financera aussi un besoin urgent d\u2019assistance pour faire face aux mauvaises r\u00e9coltes r\u00e9cemment annonc\u00e9es.  Tout comme les autres pays du Sahel en Afrique occidentale, la Gambie a souffert d\u2019un d\u00e9ficit de pr\u00e9cipitations en 2011.
