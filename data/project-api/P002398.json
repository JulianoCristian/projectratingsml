Development of upland and swampland rice, groundnuts, and maize started under the previous project, which covered 4,900 square km, would be extended to reach farmers in an additional 8,500 square km area. Fruit tree cultivation and livestock promotion would be introduced. For these purposes, the project would provide: agricultural inputs, credit, extension services, feeder roads, village wells, and technical assistance. About 13,500 farm families, or about 40 percent of rural families in the area covered by the two projects, would benefit directly and earn significantly higher incomes. All of these families earn below the relative rural poverty threshold for Sierra Leone of $67. Taking into account the general improvement in agricultural services and the road and well components, nearly 50 percent of the rural families in the Phase I and II areas would benefit. Normal risks associated with projects of this kind would be reduced by the fact that this is the second phase in the area and would build upon the organizational structure and techniques developed under the previous phase."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Sierra Leone!$!SL","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"8,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SL","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04296_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04296_1_0","DocDate":"07-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902371028","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902371028","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912514716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912514716","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Sierra Leone"}},"facets":{}}
