This program document describes the PFSPBG to the Republic of Serbia to support the Government's structural reform program and mitigate the effects of the global economic crisis. The Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) is of up to EUR 300 million, not exceeding the equivalent of US$400 million. It will cover the principal amount of a commercial loan. The procurement process for the lender to the Government of Serbia (GoS) is in an advanced stage, the lead arranger has been selected by the GoS, and the respective law is scheduled to be submitted to the Parliament for approval upon approval of the PFSPBG by the World Bank board. A policy based guarantee is in light of Serbia's strong track record in macro, structural and social policies, sustainable external financing plan, and coherent borrowing strategy."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Serbia!$!YF","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":16},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"400,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Summary of Discussion,Program Document,Project Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"YF","sectorcode":"YZ,BC,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,38,40","mjthemecode":"4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":33},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20130926100438","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130926100438","DocDate":"20-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000356161_20110213234021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110213234021","DocDate":"10-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000356161_20110121023025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110121023025","DocDate":"14-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20110104153220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20110104153220","DocDate":"01-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20101029135914","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20101029135914","DocDate":"20-OCT-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Serbia"}},"facets":{}}
