The second component will upgrade trunk routes from gravel to asphalt paved standard.  The third component will comprise consultant services for the supervision of the above civil works.  The fourth component will finance institutional strengthening and capacity building support for the Ethiopian Roads Authority.  The fifth component will provide cofinancing for the provision of technical assistance and capacity building for four Regional State Rural Roads Organizations.  The sixth component will include environmental guidelines and sector environmental assessment (EA) capacity building.  The seventh component will finance technical preparation of rural roads improvements."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Urban
