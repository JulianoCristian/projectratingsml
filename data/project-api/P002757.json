The project will support a comprehensive restructuring program for TRC comprising:  (a) reform of the regulatory framework governing the conduct of its business; (b) revamping of its organization to strengthen its capacity to manage its core railways activity; (c) restructuring of its operating procedures and systems to make operations more efficient; and (d) rebuilding of its capacity through reducing the huge backlog of deferred maintenance on its assets.  The project consists of:  (a) the rehabilitation of track, telecommunications systems, locomotives, wagons and coaches; (b) the replacement of obsolete and life-expired maintenance equipment, vehicles and coaches; (c) organizational support and training to strengthen management system and staff capacity in all functional areas; and (d) support for improvements in the working environment and incentives, including enhanced pensions, for the workforce."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":88},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"76,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"TA,TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,78,40","mjthemecode":"4,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":88},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20050719110307","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050719110307","DocDate":"22-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030708125027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030708125027","DocDate":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121031432","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121031432","DocURL":"03-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121031533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121031533","DocDate":"03-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121030831","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121030831","DocDate":"03-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121031432","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121031432","DocDate":"03-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121030831","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121030831","DocURL":"03-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121031533","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121031533","DocURL":"03-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e392eb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e392eb_1_0","DocDate":"13-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e392e9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e392e9_1_0","DocDate":"13-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930224057","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930224057","DocDate":"24-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960930224416","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930224416","DocDate":"24-MAY-1991"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
