There are eight components to the project, the first component being technical assistance for focus group study. This study will document the characteristics of the project's target group including: household composition, employee wages, household income levels, willingness and ability to pay, and potential uptake. The second component is the subsidy. The subsidy component will provide funding for the following output based components: 1) insurance premiums; 2) marketing; and 3) upgrading of two service providers. The third component is the Health Insurance Fund (HIF) project management. HIF will establish an implementation, monitoring and evaluation agreement with PharmAccess Foundation (PAF) govern the relationship for the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) project. The fourth component is the monitoring and evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation of the insurance program by PAF consists of two activities: financial and medical reporting, and quality assurance. The fifth component is the research. The bio-medical research program is an optional component of the scheme and has been included in this proposal at the recommendation of GPOBA.  It consists of medical research on the disease burden of the target population by the Center for Poverty Related Communicable Diseases (CPCD). The sixth component is the audits. Each party involved in the project will be annually audited by an independent auditor to ensure contractual compliance.  The seventh component is the World Bank and GPOBA supervision. Finally, the eighth component is the contingencies.
