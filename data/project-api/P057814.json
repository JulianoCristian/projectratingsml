The Project will support actions in the following areas: 1) improvement in governance and anti-corruption; 2) improvement in public finance management; and, 3) steps to resolve crucial issues in the energy sector. Actions taken in these areas will significantly contribute to the implementation of broader structural reforms over the medium term. At the same time, the project aims to define, in broad preliminary terms, a framework for future policy-based lending, and policy dialogue by the International Development Association (IDA), to support the country's medium-term economic growth, and poverty reduction efforts. This will further support fiscal stability and poverty reduction directly. First, the proposed project will address issues of governance, corruption, and the business environment, to facilitate new businesses, and create employment. Second, a stable fiscal environment should allow for the timely payment of salaries, pensions, and social expenditures. It will also foster Government links between the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Framework programs and the budget process. Despite risks, the new political environment, the overwhelming electoral victories at the Presidential and Parliamentary elections, and the recent return of Adjara under the authority of the Government, will help ameliorate these risks, while lessons of past adjustment lending, in particular the weak government implementation capacity, have been carefully factored into the design: a narrow focus on priority issues, and the requirement for reform implementation."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"24,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Information Document,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"GE","sectorcode":"LZ,JB,JA,YZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Rule of law","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,34,27,29,40","mjthemecode":"4,2,2,3,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":65},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20090212033850","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090212033850","DocDate":"29-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050701103641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050701103641","DocDate":"29-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010031111561788","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031111561788","DocURL":"01-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010031111561788","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031111561788","DocDate":"01-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20040608131845","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040608131845","DocDate":"02-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20040603131009","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040603131009","DocDate":"27-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20040517134717","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040517134717","DocDate":"29-APR-2004"}],"countryname":"Georgia"}},"facets":{}}
