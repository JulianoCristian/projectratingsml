While an undisbursed amount of International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan no. 4862 (US$163.7m) was already cancelled, there was a balance in the designated account of International Development Association (IDA) credit no. 4338 that needed to be refunded upon reimbursement of the final claim. As the final reimbursement and refund were completed, this restructuring paper seeks approval for cancellation of the unutilized balance of IDA credit no. 4338."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
