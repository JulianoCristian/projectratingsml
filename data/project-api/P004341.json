It will finance the import of equipment, materials, spare parts and other inputs needed in coal and copper mining and the transport sector. Mongolia has one of the lowest population densities in the world. In addition, the geography and infrastructure of the country make access to foreign markets difficult and costly. Mongolia followed the Soviet model of a centrally planned command economy. In 1990 an elected coalition began a program of economic transformation to a market based economy. The economy has suffered from external shocks, although a pickup in activity in the emerging private sector, industry and agriculture production has been constrained by shortages of intermediate goods and spare parts. The government has been implementing privatization, price liberalization, changes in laws and regulations to stabilize and transform the economy since 1990. This project's scope and content takes into account assistance planned or already underway by other bilateral and multilateral agencies."},"country_namecode":"Mongolia!$!MN","sector1":{"Name":"Mining and other extractive","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Mining and other extractive"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MN","sectorcode":"YZ,BC,LC,LB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Economic management"],"themecode":"23,24","mjthemecode":"1,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Mining and other extractive","code":"LB"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":40},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3971023103643","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971023103643","DocDate":"22-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122002565","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122002565","DocDate":"04-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122002565","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122002565","DocURL":"04-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b2fc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b2fc_1_0","DocDate":"28-OCT-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005042834","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005042834","DocDate":"01-OCT-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005042543","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005042543","DocDate":"01-OCT-1993"}],"countryname":"Mongolia"}},"facets":{}}
