Urban infrastructure would be furnished to provide sites and services and to upgrade low income residential areas in two towns of Bauchi State. Sites would also be provided for small scale enterprises so as to furnish employment. Low income families would be given access to construction loans and supporting social services would be provided in the project area. The project would benefit 74,000 people with incomes below the urban median for Bauchi State. The project also seeks to strengthen the planning and project implementation capabilities of key institutions so that the experience gained from this pilot project may be applied to other parts of the country. In this context, technical assistance would be provided to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) and to state and local authorities participating in the project. In addition, the FMBN would finance from the loan, studies for the preparation of urban development projects in seven other states."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"17,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"UH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban housing","code":"UH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924222055","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924222055","DocDate":"08-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e958af_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958af_1_0","DocDate":"13-NOV-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e958ad_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958ad_1_0","DocDate":"13-NOV-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e958ac_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958ac_1_0","DocDate":"13-NOV-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e976c3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976c3_1_0","DocDate":"13-NOV-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e976c2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976c2_1_0","DocDate":"13-NOV-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902334833","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902334833","DocDate":"31-OCT-1979"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
