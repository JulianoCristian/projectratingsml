This regional institution, the Regional Management School for CEAO (Centre d'Etudes Africain Superieures en Gestion, CESAG), will be located in Dakar, and will absorb the programs now being conducted at the Senegalese management training school (Ecole Superieure de Gestion d'Entreprises, ESGE) established in 1979 under International Development Association's (IDA's) Third Education Project. The principal functions of CESAG will be to: (a) establish broadly based graduate-level programs to train managerial personnel in private and parapublic enterprises; (b) organize short upgrading programs in specific subjects for managers; (c) serve as a resource center for other institutions in CEAO member countries which offer management training programs, by setting up appropriate courses for teaching staff and providing assistance in developing training materials; (d) serve as a research center for development of management systems adapted to the African environment; and (e) provide consulting services in planning and implementation of organization and management systems."},"country_namecode":"Western Africa!$!3W","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"3W","sectorcode":"ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925234219","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925234219","DocDate":"22-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000334955_20090128062831","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090128062831","DocDate":"22-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36a95_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36a95_1_0","DocDate":"26-NOV-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36a93_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36a93_1_0","DocDate":"26-NOV-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094136","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094136","DocDate":"31-OCT-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100412031156","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100412031156","DocDate":"31-OCT-1985"}],"countryname":"Western Africa"}},"facets":{}}
