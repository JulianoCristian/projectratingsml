The project comprises the improvement of three irrigation command areas serving a total net irrigable area of about 248,000 feddan. The subprojects are Mahmoudia in Baheira Governorate; Manaifa; and El Wasat in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate. Existing delivery system of main and secondary canals will be improved and provided with control structures, telemetry system and mixing stations installed for reuse of drainage effluent. The tertiary systems will be developed with provision of single lift pumps, lined or pvc pipe tertiary laterals. An irrigation advisory service will be established to assist with organization and training of farmers into water users groups at tertiary level and water users' associations at the secondary level."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"BC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,82,85,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20070718094251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20070718094251","DocDate":"29-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122033525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122033525","DocDate":"27-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122033324","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122033324","DocDate":"27-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122033525","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122033525","DocURL":"27-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122033324","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122033324","DocURL":"27-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b45a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b45a_1_0","DocDate":"22-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b459_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b459_1_0","DocDate":"22-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d83_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d83_1_0","DocDate":"22-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d82_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d82_1_0","DocDate":"22-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007010103","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007010103","DocDate":"01-DEC-1994"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
