Therefore, project components will: 1) provide TA in implementing reforms of the Municipal Financial Management Bill/Act, which prescribes budgeting, accounting, and financial reporting systems, with reforms implemented through a three-phase process. Implementation of additional reforms, such as regulatory reforms to encourage the development of municipal finance markets, and for reforms in intergovernmental fiscal transfer programs will be addressed; 2) design, and implement a municipal sector monitoring, and early warning system, through an active transformation of corporate structures; and, 3) assist with additional policy reforms in the municipal sector, for accessing resources, ensuring provision of basic services, particularly for the poor. Moreover, policy formulation will focus on strategies, and institutional design, linking these reforms to appropriate management and regulation, to finally address financing of the overall strategy. As well, municipal finance market development will be emphasized, with significant TA input, as will linkages between budgeting and planning."},"country_namecode":"Republic of South Africa!$!ZA","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":33},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ZA","sectorcode":"BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"30,72","mjthemecode":"9,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":67},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":33}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090602005300","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090602005300","DocDate":"31-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041909400850","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041909400850","DocDate":"25-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0208300405296","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0208300405296","DocDate":"12-AUG-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_01120704074151","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01120704074151","DocDate":"17-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01120704173359","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01120704173359","DocDate":"29-NOV-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of South Africa"}},"facets":{}}
