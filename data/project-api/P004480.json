Its subcomponents will be broadly determined by an annual lending program prepared by DBP in consultation with concerned agencies are envisaged to include financing of small livestock and cattle, fishponds and marine vessels and other items to support the two subsectors, including slaughter-houses, iceplants, etc. Although production is its principal objective, the project aims to support small- and medium-scale entrepreneurs in order to redress some of the regional development imbalances. Noncredit components include consultant services and support to sectoral agencies. The main risks include the possibility of inadequate interagency coordination, possible lack of regional focus and narrowing profit margins if output prices continue to be held down by Government. The loan agreement contains a number of provisions concerned with interagency coordination and the strengthening of the regional focus."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925042914","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925042914","DocDate":"28-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e95ee6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95ee6_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUL-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902355065","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902355065","DocDate":"30-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912484896","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912484896","DocDate":"30-JUN-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
