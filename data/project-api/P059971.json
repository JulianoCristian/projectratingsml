The project has two main components. The first component finances a quality improvement grants program that 1) recruits and trains \"animators\" (or \"lightning rods\") who work with community and school cluster leaders to engage them in discussions about effective schools, in identifying problems and solutions, and in developing cluster improvement plans as a basis for preparing grant proposals; 2) supports a provincial grants management committee which meets annually to review proposals; 3) provides quality improvement grants to school clusters; 4) and supplies training, monitoring, and evaluation funds for activities related to the professional development of animators as well as assisting in monitoring and evaluating grants by other officials. The second component supports the institutional strengthening/capacity building of Cambodia's education sector by supporting the National Committee on Effective Schooling; funding policy studies, including grade four examinations and decentralization); and providing operational support for provincial and district education offices."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Cambodia!$!KH","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":79},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Brief,Brief,Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"KH","sectorcode":"BH,BC,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"65,61,57","mjthemecode":"7,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":79},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333037_20150129224812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20150129224812","DocDate":"20-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333037_20150129223223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20150129223223","DocDate":"20-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333037_20150129234321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20150129234321","DocDate":"20-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20041006093930","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041006093930","DocDate":"30-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201094049","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201094049","DocURL":"29-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99092004315347","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99092004315347","DocDate":"23-AUG-1999"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Cambodia"}},"facets":{}}
