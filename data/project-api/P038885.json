The project will ensure that funds are targeted and reliably transferred to the poorest communities, and will promote further decentralization of decision-making to State, municipal and local levels. The project comprises three components: community subprojects supporting infrastrture, social, and productive small-scale industrial investments; institutional development providing technical assistance and training to increase capacity and improve implementation of the project; and project administration, monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":23},"sector2":{"Name":"Power","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":23},"sector4":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":22},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"36,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BH,AI,WC,LD,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"76,26,78,77","mjthemecode":"10,10,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":23},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":23},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":23},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02011904004965","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02011904004965","DocDate":"21-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200201436","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200201436","DocURL":"18-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200201537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200201537","DocDate":"18-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200201436","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200201436","DocDate":"18-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200201537","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200201537","DocURL":"18-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e4e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e4e_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e4d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e4d_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008042725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008042725","DocDate":"06-JUN-1995"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
