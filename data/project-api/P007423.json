Credits will be made available under the project to larger SSEs (enterprises with net fixed assets of up to US$100,000, excluding real property) through the commercial banking system and to the very small SSEs (enterprises with net fixed assets of up to US$20,000 excluding real property) through a new institution, the Small Enterprise Development Corporation (SEDCO), designed to serve such enterprises. It is anticipated that the project would provide about 100 credits to large SSEs, averaging about US$69,000 each and about 300 credits to very small SSEs, averaging about US$13,000 each."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"7,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"JM","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101342","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101342","DocDate":"31-DEC-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e36d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e36d_1_0","DocDate":"06-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e36b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e36b_1_0","DocDate":"06-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902311525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902311525","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912384359","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912384359","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"}],"countryname":"Jamaica"}},"facets":{}}
