The project's development objectives are to slow down the spread of HIV and build up the national capacity to respond to the epidemic. This will be accomplished by: (a) behavior change among vulnerable groups at high risk; and (b) improving knowledge of HIV prevention and reducing stigma related to HIV and AIDS in the general population. The project has four components: communications and advocacy activities will aim to increase knowledge of HIV prevention among opinion leaders and the general population, and reduce stigma and discrimination against vulnerable groups at high risk of HIV and AIDS; strengthening HIV surveillance through biological and behavioral surveys and knowledge attitudes and practice studies; targeted interventions for people engaged in high risk behaviors, including injecting drug use and unsafe sex; and program management, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, and an Innovation Initiative to promote multi sector activities in support of project objectives."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Central
