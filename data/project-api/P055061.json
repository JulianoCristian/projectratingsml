P7223) share the same broad development objective: to support the design and implementation of major policy changes in the health sector in Mexico, mainly through reforms in the Mexico Social Security Institute (IMSS). The specific objectives of the Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) are to provide the government with the necessary technical resources to design and implement the reform, and to strengthen IMSS and participating providers. There are four components. The first component provides technical assistance for policy design and to implement new resolutions, regulations, and operational guidelines under the SSHF/IDF (the Social Security Health Fund and the Innovative Development Fund); changes in the regulatory framework of SECAL (Sector Adjustment Loan); and a new regulatory database. The second component, institutional strengthening, finances consultant services for corporate restructuring of IMSS. The third component finances management training at both central and decentralized levels, technical training to bio-medical personnel to maintain equipment ands infrastructure, and training to implement alternative provider payment systems and cost-accounting. The fourth component funds project coordination, monitors activities under the TAL and progress under SECAL, and executes a public awareness campaign."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,67","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":86},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030707135042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030707135042","DocDate":"27-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929100551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929100551","DocDate":"13-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201403860","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201403860","DocDate":"14-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201403860","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201403860","DocURL":"14-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201403759","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201403759","DocURL":"14-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201403759","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201403759","DocDate":"14-SEP-1998"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
