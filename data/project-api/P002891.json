The project has five main components: 1) Agricultural services -the creation of a technical assistance and support institute responsible for providing improved extension services to farmers and support to farmer organizations; 2) Agricultural research -merging all existing research institutions into a newly-created, decentralized, autonomous, semi-private agricultural research institute; 3) Agricultural credit -implementing pilot grassroots savings and loans operations through selected nongovernmental organizations to test an approach for ensuring accessibility for small producers, including women; 4) Agricultural credit -a village development fund to finance small rural infrastructure; and 5) The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries (MAEP) -reorganizing this agency to build up its capacity in policy design, planning, programming, monitoring, control, and program evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Togo!$!TG","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":52},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"26,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TG","sectorcode":"FE,BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,77,44,57,25","mjthemecode":"2,7,4,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":52},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20031002101631","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20031002101631","DocDate":"30-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121300289","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121300289","DocURL":"14-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121300289","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121300289","DocDate":"14-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3971104184223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971104184223","DocDate":"13-AUG-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Togo"}},"facets":{}}
