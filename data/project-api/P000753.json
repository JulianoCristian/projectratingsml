The project is expected to achieve this objective by: a) supporting policy reform to create an enabling environment for the growth of a competitive fertilizer sector; b) supporting institutional strengthening and human resource development; c) promoting increased, efficient and environmentally safe use of fertilizers by the largest possible number of farmers; d) addressing fertilizer supply-side constraints; and e) promoting initiatives to maintain and improve the long-term fertility of the Ethiopian soils and ensuring environmental conservation. By the end of the project period, it is envisaged that Ethiopia's fertilizer sector would have moved from a state controlled to a largely liberalized system with active participation of private sector importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers in a progressively competitive price and trade environment. This, in turn, is expected to contribute significantly to enhanced food security at the national and household levels, improved management of the Ethiopian soils and the strengthening of fertilizer related institutions."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Petrochemicals and fertilizers","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Petrochemicals and fertilizers"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"BC,AB,YD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,84,68,79","mjthemecode":"10,8,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Petrochemicals and fertilizers","code":"YD"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":92},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000020953_20071010102931","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20071010102931","DocDate":"21-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03012804015774","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03012804015774","DocDate":"26-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0105110432043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0105110432043","DocDate":"30-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121263971","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121263971","DocDate":"29-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121263971","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121263971","DocURL":"29-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121263770","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121263770","DocURL":"29-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121263770","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121263770","DocDate":"29-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23eb3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23eb3_1_0","DocDate":"13-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019095858","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019095858","DocDate":"24-APR-1995"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
