The project will support a rural road development program for a three-year period beginning April 1982 in about 25 kabupatens (districts) in the five provinces of North Sumatra, West Sumatra, Bangkulu, Jambi and West Java. The programs will be based on an improved methodology for screening possible road works using data readily available and for selecting economically justified works. In addition, the project would support an improvement program for the provincial public works agency in Jambi Province. Equipment will be provided for force account work and for leasing to small contractors. Consulting services will be provided to assist in implementation of the road works programs, in monitoring and evaluating those programs, and in preparing future programs for additional districts and provinces."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Rural roads","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Rural roads"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"TR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Rural roads","code":"TR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925093112","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925093112","DocDate":"09-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9772a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9772a_1_0","DocDate":"12-JAN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902384533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902384533","DocDate":"31-DEC-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
