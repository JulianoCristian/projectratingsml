The three main project components aim to: 1) establish decentralized, and participatory planning procedures at the community level, and other groups that operate within the regional government structure. Communities will identify, design, and implement micro-projects, reflecting their development priorities, supported by capacity building, and required training, while the Community Investment Fund will provide investment to support infrastructure, and public service delivery; 2) build a community-based early warning system to establish a communal collection, and analysis of basic household welfare data, focusing on sub-groups to design pastoral production systems. A disaster contingency planning subcomponent will build capacity at regional levels for disaster preparedness - mitigation and rapid response - for drought management and recovery activities, providing grants to finance activities identified in contingency plans; and, 3) support operational, and training resources for the federal, and regional project coordination units, to ensure fiduciary obligations, policy analysis and liaison with stakeholder groups, and a multi-sectoral coordination."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"JB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,86,57,52","mjthemecode":"6,7,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":70},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20090730021456","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090730021456","DocDate":"26-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000334955_20080327093102","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080327093102","DocDate":"01-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000082466_2006022811301276","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000082466_2006022811301276","DocURL":"15-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20030502140315","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030502140315","DocDate":"22-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02041104093655","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02041104093655","DocDate":"19-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03030604014968","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03030604014968","DocDate":"10-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02041104202174","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02041104202174","DocDate":"30-DEC-2002"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
