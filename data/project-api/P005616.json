The Government of Tunisia has requested a Bank loan to help finance subprojects in the Lower Medjerda Valley (Medjerda) and East-Central Tunisia (Nebhana) comprising: rehabilitation of the existing irrigation, drainage, and road networks; construction of rural infrastructure; on-farm development; and strengthening of management, extension, marketing services and employment of consultants. The project also includes assistance in land reform in Nebhana through land consolidation and establishment of farm titles as well as in the preparation of detailed engineering designs and feasibility studies for future on-farm development. In addition, the project will finance a land reform specialist to strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture's Directorate of Land Affairs and Legislation (DAFL) in its nationwide operations."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101154","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101154","DocDate":"31-DEC-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902233931","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902233931","DocDate":"31-DEC-1974"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e7266e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7266e_1_0","DocDate":"19-DEC-1974"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e7266d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7266d_1_0","DocDate":"19-DEC-1974"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7266b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7266b_1_0","DocDate":"19-DEC-1974"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100208020552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100208020552","DocDate":"10-DEC-1974"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
