The Hard Coal Mine Closure Project will directly support the physical closure, and environmental reclamation of excess coal mine capacity from CY 2004-2006. It envisages main economic and social objectives, that improve profitability, and the financial liquidity of the sector, i.e., allows regular payments of its liabilities, including payments of environmental fees, and, mitigates the social consequences of the program's implementation. The objectives are to be achieved through reform, in the areas of industry structure, mine closure, employment and financial restructuring, and, privatization. Through its five components the project will, first, liquidate underground workings and shafts, remove equipment, and secure underground areas. This will entail closure of underground roadways through dams, and if necessary, dewatering should prevent water hazards to neighboring operating mines, keeping the underground partly functional. Following liquidation, demolition and clearing surface structures will take place. Activities include shafts liquidation, by isolating materials such as clay, closing with a cement cap; demolition of existing buildings, or, if possible, for sale option; dismantling of installations, structures, and equipment; stabilization of waste dumps, and, closure of tailings ponds. Preparation of a comprehensive dewatering master plan, environmental management plans, and mine closure plans, including engineering design studies and supporting documentation will be conducted. Land reclamation will be implemented in two phases: a) preparation of land for industrial activity, which will include clea"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Mining and
