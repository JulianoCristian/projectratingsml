In order to support BAPINDO's efforts to provide financial assistance to small- and medium-scale, relatively labor-intensive enterprises, a component of $15 million will be earmarked for financing specifically: (a) enterprises with fixed assets not exceeding $1.0 million; or (b) projects generating employment at a fixed investment cost per job not greater than $12,000. In addition, out of the proceeds of the loan, $100,000 will be utilized to finance the services of a project promotion specialist and a staff training program to help BAPINDO improve its project promotion capability."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902325515","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902325515","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e4b8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e4b8_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e4b6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e4b6_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
