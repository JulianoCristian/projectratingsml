(CEMIG), Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina S.A. (CELESC), and Espirito Santo Centrais Eletricas S.A. (ESCELSA). The utilities' overall program, of which the project forms a part, will provide the facilities required to serve the expected loads in the respective utilities' service areas, mostly related to industrial growth. The program will also be instrumental in making public service electricity available to about 62,000 new low-income urban consumers and in connecting about 48,000 new rural consumers. The project also includes the acquisition of communications and control equipment for CEMIG, and about 80 man-months of consulting services for CELESC and ESCELSA for supervision of construction of 138 kV facilities and for preparation of bidding documents."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"130,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925020140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925020140","DocDate":"20-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912373750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912373750","DocDate":"31-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902300712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902300712","DocDate":"31-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84fa2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84fa2_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84fa1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84fa1_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84fa0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84fa0_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f9d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f9d_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f9c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f9c_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e84f9b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f9b_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e84f9a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f9a_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e84f99_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f99_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1978"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
