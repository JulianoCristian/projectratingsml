The additional financing would use funds from the International Development Association (IDA) pilot Crisis Response Window (CRW) aimed at addressing some of the near-term impacts of the current financial crisis and sustaining social activities while the government's policy responses is taking effect along with the progressive deployment of donor support. It would protect the functioning of essential social services when the resources of the national budget are negatively impacted by the crisis. It will therefore help protect core spending to preserve human and social capital, a key objective of the Pilot CRW. The additional financing (US$28.7 million) expand or scale-up the project to enhance its development impact (US$14.6 million); meet a financing gap resulting from the delayed availability of parallel funding sources (US$12.0 million); and finance cost overruns to complete some original project activities (US$2.1 million)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cameroon!$!CM","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Projet de d\u00e9veloppement des secteurs urbain et de l\u2019approvisionnement en eau</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>L\u2019objectif de d\u00e9veloppement du Projet d\u2019appui aux secteurs du d\u00e9veloppement urbain et de l\u2019eau au Cameroun est d\u2019accro\u00eetre l\u2019acc\u00e8s de la population urbaine, en particulier des habitants des quartiers d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s, aux infrastructures et services de base, notamment \u00e0 l\u2019eau.
