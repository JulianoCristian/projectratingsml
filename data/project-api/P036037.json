The first of five components assists the four countries in upgrading their national legislative framework to accede to the relevant covenants and protocols by sponsoring a regional workshop on convention ratification and implementation; and providing expert consultants. The second component helps develop national contingency plans by improving environment data collection and management systems, identifying and establishing priorities, testing national contingency plans, and carrying out exercises. The third component evaluates local handling facilities, anticipates an accident scenario, appraises local and climatic conditions, creates a response strategy, identifies equipment, and provides training. The fourth component builds national capacity by designing and holding expert-led workshops and an expert-developed and tested response manual, providing training, and funding government participation in international seminars. The fifth component develops regional planning and agreements for cooperation, training, and coordination."},"country_namecode":"Africa!$!3A","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"3,150,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"3A","sectorcode":"BG,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,33,84,82,47","mjthemecode":"5,11,11,3,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":86},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009486_20050110112250","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009486_20050110112250","DocDate":"15-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99061607121840","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99061607121840","DocDate":"01-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99030406221388","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99030406221388","DocDate":"20-OCT-1998"}],"countryname":"Africa"}},"facets":{}}
