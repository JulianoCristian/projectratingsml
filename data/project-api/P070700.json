The reallocation is necessary to bring the project to an orderly closure. The reallocated amounts reflect the final estimates of category expenses near the end of the project that will be accounted for in the four months following project closure. The changes primarily reflect the increase in civil works costs due to improving the construction standards of the watchtowers, changes in training, workshop, and costs, as well as recruitment of additional interns and consultants to help with the biodiversity catalog development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"Central government
