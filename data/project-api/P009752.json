Because the Second Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project involves large and complex civil engineering works, there is a risk that temporary shortages of materials, lateness on the part of manufacturers in meeting contractual delivery dates, or lack of management skills on the part of contractors could lead to delays in implementation. However, BMC is expected to be able to minimize the impact of these delaying factors as a result of the experience and improved management techniques it has gained as a result of the first IDA-assisted Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"196,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902304472","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902304472","DocDate":"31-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912385677","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912385677","DocDate":"31-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfcffe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfcffe_1_0","DocDate":"25-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfcffd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfcffd_1_0","DocDate":"25-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c26_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c26_1_0","DocDate":"25-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c25_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c25_1_0","DocDate":"25-JUL-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
