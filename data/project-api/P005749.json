The objectives will be realized through improving maintenance of rural roads, particularly unpaved ones; decentralizing road management responsibilities to local governments, without developing new entities; establishing a link between budgets and road classification; strengthening budgetary disciplines, transparency and accountability; targeting specific road maintenance tasks for execution by contract to improve efficiency and to create new development opportunities for a dynamic private sector; and finally minimizing life-cycle costs by making optimum use of gravel road techniques. The project includes: 1) the preparation and initial implementation of an institutional reform program; 2) the periodic rehabilitation of approximately 300 km of gravel roads in a pilot program to be carried out by contract in ten Governorates; and 3) the upgrading of about 715 km of priority rural roads to appropriate standards."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"51,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,29,44,78","mjthemecode":"10,4,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040107103752","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040107103752","DocDate":"22-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040729102716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040729102716","DocDate":"25-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123064156","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123064156","DocURL":"14-FEB-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123064156","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123064156","DocDate":"14-FEB-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3db2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3db2_1_0","DocDate":"31-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007202055","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007202055","DocDate":"03-JAN-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
