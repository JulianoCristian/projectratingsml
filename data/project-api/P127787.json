Further enhancing the economy's potential over the medium term and reaching high-income status will require more structural reforms, particularly at the micro level, to bolster competitiveness and boost private savings. This document describes a Euro 624.1 million (USD 800 million equivalent) Competitiveness and Savings Development Policy Loan (CSDPL) to Turkey. It is a one-tranche stand-alone operation. The objective of the program supported by the proposed operation is to facilitate Turkey's growth to high-income status by bolstering competitiveness and boosting domestic savings, thus reducing external vulnerabilities over the medium term. This operation is a critical part of the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which was endorsed by the Executive Board on March 27, 2012. The DPL will contribute to the following expected CPS outcomes under the competitiveness pillar: (i) sustained macroeconomic and financial stability and strengthened exports, domestic savings, and external resilience and (ii) improved investment and business climate; deepened and broadened access to finance. The operation will also contribute to deepening reforms for improved competitiveness, one of the main strategic priorities in the 2012 Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional strategy."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":16},"sector5":{"Name":"SME Finance","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"800,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance"},{"Name":"Capital markets"},{"Name":"SME Finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Letter of Development Policy,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"FH,FK,FD,JB,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"87,41,45,34","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"3,5,4,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","code":"FD"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"},{"name":"SME Finance","code":"FH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":34},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":17},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":17},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":16},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b082035368_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082035368_1_0","DocDate":"05-NOV-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081c599d8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c599d8_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20130517091817","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130517091817","DocDate":"02-MAY-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Letter of Development Policy (DPL),  Vol.","DocType":"DPL","EntityID":"090224b081c59dce_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c59dce_1_0","DocDate":"26-APR-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000001843_20130319094416","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130319094416","DocDate":"19-MAR-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000001843_20130117085812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130117085812","DocDate":"03-JAN-2013"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
