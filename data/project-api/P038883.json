The project will help firms to become more internationally competitive through three avenues: 1) the project will help increase awareness among entrepreneurs about export opportunities through the provision of basic information about foreign markets and profitable export strategies; 2) the project will prompt a limited number of enterprises to invest their own resources in productivity improvements and export development expenditures through the incentive of a one-time grant to share these costs; and 3) the project will help to improve the performance of agencies providing quality control and certification services. The project will also facilitate export growth by supporting the simplification and reduction of export procedures. It will have two main components: 1) an enterprise assistance program to develop export competencies in the private sector in manufacturing and service industries; and 2) an institutional strengthening to help improve the performance of export-related public agencies."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":82},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":18},"theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"38,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"BC,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"49,45","mjthemecode":"5,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":82},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":18}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0009210532109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0009210532109","DocDate":"28-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200215905","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200215905","DocURL":"26-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200215804","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200215804","DocDate":"26-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200215804","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200215804","DocURL":"26-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200215905","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200215905","DocDate":"26-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb87_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb87_1_0","DocDate":"28-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019140434","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019140434","DocDate":"02-NOV-1995"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
