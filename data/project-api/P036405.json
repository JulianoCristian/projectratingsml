Specific objectives include: a) reducing water supply infrastructure bottlenecks; b) increasing employment and incomes; reducing the urban distress caused by insufficient and intermittent water supplies; d) environmental improvement by ending the over extraction of groundwater and treating all waste; e) creating a system to rationalize water use and reduce greater shortages and f) promoting integrated management and financial independence for water institutions.  The project will include the following components: a) Yellow River Diversion Project Corporation (YRDPC), providing the physical works needed to transfer water from the yellow River through a system of tunnels, aqueduct pipelines and reservoirs; b) water resources institutional reform; and c) water pollution control and industrial waste management."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
