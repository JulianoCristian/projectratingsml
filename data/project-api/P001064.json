The main objective being to assist farmers who operate at a very low level of technology in improving the productivity of their farming systems. These objectives will be accomplished through: (a) providing the support to plan, manage, and monitor a National Research and Extension Program; (b) funding and expanding commodity research; (c) testing of locally available crop varieties and production techniques; and (d) creation and consolidation of links among research, extension, and farmers. Further, the project will also provide for the development of an institutional framework for promoting farmer organizations and a major training program to develop the Guinean capacity for designing, managing, and implementing research and extension operations."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":61},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"18,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"JB,BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"75,78,77","mjthemecode":"10,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":61},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":35},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042608491344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042608491344","DocDate":"15-JAN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042608410743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042608410743","DocDate":"31-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030210165045","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030210165045","DocDate":"29-NOV-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08360_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08360_1_0","DocDate":"15-SEP-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927004706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927004706","DocDate":"24-AUG-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927004511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927004511","DocDate":"24-AUG-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
