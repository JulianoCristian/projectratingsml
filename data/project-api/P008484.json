The project provides technical assistance, fellowships, training, preparation of studies, development of health programs, computer hardware and software, medical and office furniture, equipment, teaching materials, refurbishment of facilities and incremental recurrent costs. Health sector restructuring will focus on more effective interventions through strategic investments in public health and selected institutional services. It will complement ongoing reforms financed by other international donors that aim to strengthen community services, primary care and the private health care sector. The project supports proven action-oriented approaches to public health, as well as the creation of a \"close the gap\" program launching new initiatives in health promotion and disease prevention. It targets certain institutional services for special attention because of their direct impact on Hungary's most pressing health problems."},"country_namecode":"Hungary!$!HU","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"91,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HU","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"25,67","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02022704015340","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022704015340","DocDate":"16-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200110075","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200110075","DocURL":"27-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200110075","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200110075","DocDate":"27-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003135002","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003135002","DocDate":"05-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003134800","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003134800","DocDate":"05-MAR-1993"}],"countryname":"Hungary","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
