Specifically, the project will: a) assist participating schools to achieve basic operational level (BOL); and b) build up the capacity of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) to plan and manage education services. The project was prepared by IDA, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and UK Department for International Development (DFID). The components are: 1) support to education service providers to bring primary schools and Junior Secondary Schools (JSS) to BOL standards by a) introduce peace education into the curriculum, b) support non-formal and emergency education programs, c) HIV / AIDS education prevention, d) support the expansion of the Grants Program; and 2) enhance the institutional capacity of the MEST by a) establishing a Project Coordination Union (PCU); b) strengthening the MEST's planning and management capacity; and c) support the training of 80 teacher trainers who will provide in-service training for unqualified teachers. The Bank's role in supporting a participatory approach in disarmament, reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in Sierra Leone positions this project to continue to build up the education sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Sierra Leone!$!SL","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"SL","sectorcode":"BC,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"65,58","mjthemecode":"7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":40},{"Name":"Education","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20111107231852","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20111107231852","DocDate":"22-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052710000707","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052710000707","DocDate":"28-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03021304094462","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03021304094462","DocDate":"28-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02032204180890","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02032204180890","DocDate":"01-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02052904093672","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02052904093672","DocDate":"28-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0110190427246","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0110190427246","DocDate":"11-OCT-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Sierra Leone"}},"facets":{}}
