Under the first component the project will commence the strengthening of federal and provincial environmental protection agencies and initiate environmental impact assessments of new investments to develop a framework for introducing environmental policy considerations into public and private investment decisions; raise policy makers' and the public's awareness of damage to Pakistan's environment and natural resources; and develop professional training in environmental planning and management.  Under the second component, the project will undertake a series of subprojects, including studies, pilot, and operational work, to repair damage done to natural resources such as watersheds, rangelands, and wildlife populations. Nongovernmental organizations have contributed to the design of several subprojects.  Subproject implementation will emphasize community involvement and monitoring and evaluation of subprojects inputs, outputs and effects.  The subprojects are linked to the institutional development in that they are designed according to the government of Pakistan's environmental and natural resource management policies, and will allow the policy formulators to see and monitor the effects of their policies, and, if necessary, adjust the policies over time.  The project will also provide funds for staff training and technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":27},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":4},"sector5":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"29,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"WC,TA,BC,AZ,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"80,83,79,82,78","mjthemecode":"10,11,10,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":27},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":4},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00041905425462","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00041905425462","DocDate":"24-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123300117","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123300117","DocURL":"01-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123300318","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123300318","DocDate":"01-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123300117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123300117","DocDate":"01-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123300318","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123300318","DocURL":"01-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e3954e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3954e_1_0","DocDate":"11-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e3954c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3954c_1_0","DocDate":"11-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001231610","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001231610","DocDate":"14-MAY-1992"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
