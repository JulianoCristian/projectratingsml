The DPO focuses on supporting the Government's plans to invest in demand and supply-side approaches in order to improve governance in the natural resources sector and specifically target improved revenue management, financial flows and livelihoods in the forestry, wildlife and mining sub-sectors. The DPO will support Government of Ghana (GoG) actions that enable dialogue with complementary funding facilities for expanded civil society engagement in natural resources governance. The expected outcomes at the end of the DPO series include: (i) improved management of government revenues and finances in the forestry and mining sectors; (ii) reduced illegal logging; (iii) reduced social conflict in forestry and mining communities; and (iv) integration of environmental considerations into policy formulation and implementation across government, including risks associated with climate change."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":18},"theme2":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":10},"theme3":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":18},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":54},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"LC,AT,LS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,80,83,77","mjthemecode":"10,11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","code":"LS"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":40},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":40},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000442464_20140718092837","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20140718092837","DocDate":"30-JUN-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20120112013538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120112013538","DocDate":"28-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010110311495791","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010110311495791","DocDate":"08-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000020953_20100513145527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20100513145527","DocDate":"03-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100414144042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100414144042","DocDate":"09-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000101930_20091222152648","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000101930_20091222152648","DocDate":"17-DEC-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
