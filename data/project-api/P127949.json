This emergency project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide a grant in an amount of SDR 18.8 million (US$30 million equivalent) to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), for the benefit of refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia, in support of the Horn of Africa Emergency Health and Nutrition Project. The operation will support the expansion of UNHCR's on-going program of health and nutrition service delivery to the targeted refugee camps. This humanitarian crisis is a result of the worst drought in 60 years and has yielded a severe food crisis. The operation will contribute to the overall on-going international response through the provision of complementary resources for emergency health and nutrition interventions to vulnerable populations in targeted refugee areas in Kenya and Ethiopia."},"country_namecode":"Africa!$!3A","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Projet d\u2019urgence d\u2019appui \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et la nutrition pour la Corne de l'Afrique</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>L\u2019objectif de d\u00e9veloppement du Projet d\u2019urgence d\u2019appui \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 la nutrition pour la Corne de l'Afrique est de renforcer la r\u00e9ponse aux urgences dans des camps de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s cibl\u00e9s au Kenya et en \u00c9thiopie par l'extension de la mise en \u0153uvre du programme de services sanitaires et nutritionnels, en conformit\u00e9 avec les objectifs de d\u00e9veloppement humain \u00e0 moyen terme de la sous-r\u00e9gion.
