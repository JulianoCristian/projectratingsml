Major components include: (i) construction of 26 km of pipeline, pump stations, treatment works and miscellaneous facilities; (ii) pumping and treatment plant, vehicles, tools, stores, and miscellaneous equipment; and (iii) consulting engineering services to supervise the Francistown improvements and investigate the feasibility of raising the Gaborone Dam. The Project would meet Francistown's water requirements until 1988/89, and would raise water quality to international standards. The Project faces no technical risks, but WUC would have to raise tariffs substantially from existing levels to recover project costs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Botswana!$!BW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"4,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BW","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924221742","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924221742","DocDate":"26-JUN-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e958a0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958a0_1_0","DocDate":"23-OCT-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9589e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9589e_1_0","DocDate":"23-OCT-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190233364","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190233364","DocDate":"30-SEP-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Botswana"}},"facets":{}}
