The project consists of four components. First, community initiatives will enable each of the participating community to receive funds for infrastructure subprojects, income-generating subprojects, and capacity building subprojects. Second, institution and capacity building will finance participatory rural appraisals and training activities to build local capacities for sustainable, self-reliant development. The training program will include: 1) participatory and rural appraisal methods; 2) organizational management; 3) project management; 4) financial management; and 5) environmental awareness and training. The third component will finance studies to deepen the understanding of the concept of decentralization and participation. Fourth, project coordination and monitoring will provide critical equipment, materials and supplies to the Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":17},"sector5":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"BZ,YB,TZ,JB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"79,58,56,26,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,2,6,7,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040106120040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040106120040","DocDate":"24-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911050797","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911050797","DocDate":"23-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201014420","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201014420","DocURL":"11-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201014420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201014420","DocDate":"11-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910500160","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910500160","DocDate":"15-OCT-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
