Specifically, the ERGG-3 focuses on continuing and deepening policy reforms to improve public financial management (PFM) and governance of key sectors of the economy. It is in this challenging context that the grant aims to assist the Togolese Government in continuing the implementation of its reform agenda to support the country's economic and social recovery and lay the foundation for sustained pro-poor growth. The recent shocks have exposed the fragility of Togo's institutions of economic and financial management but also the resolve of policy makers to sustain their reform program. The grant will continue to support government-owned reforms to improve governance, transparency and efficiency in public financial management as well as further advance structural reforms aimed at strengthening governance and transparency in key sectors of the economy (phosphates, cotton, and energy) launched under the ERGG and ERGG-2. These reforms will achieve strengthened fiscal sustainability, improved economic governance and enhanced transparency of State institutions and processes critical elements for the country's economic and social recovery."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Togo!$!TG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":15},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":15},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"16,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"},{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"TG","sectorcode":"LS,LT,AH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Public sector governance","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,79,30,45","mjthemecode":"5,2,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"},{"name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","code":"LS"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":20},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20110909010603","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110909010603","DocDate":"20-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011021718234375","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011021718234375","DocDate":"17-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010062312030391","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010062312030391","DocDate":"08-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000350881_20100521093944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20100521093944","DocDate":"23-APR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100323143046","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100323143046","DocDate":"08-MAR-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Togo"}},"facets":{}}
