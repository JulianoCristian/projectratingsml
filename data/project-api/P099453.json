The project objectives, revised earlier in 2010 to expand project scope, continue to be attainable, with noteworthy results and positive outcomes already achieved. The project implementation is progressing well, reflected in a consistently satisfactory rating for implementation progress over the project life. $3.19 million or 73 percent of total International Development Association (IDA) grant funds have disbursed. Financial management performance is satisfactory with good internal controls and there are no overdue audits. Financial covenants have been complied with. The extensional is necessary to allow additional time for remaining project activities to be completed. Implementation was delayed by a protracted process to complete the earlier project restructuring compounded by some disruption of project activities due to civil unrest in 2010. The Government has revised the project action plan to reflect an updated implementation schedule to complete project activities by December 31, 2011. The project team fully supports the request as the extension will provide the time needed to fully achieve project objectives."},"country_namecode":"Kyrgyz Republic!$!KG","sector1":{"Name":"General
