The project seeks to: (1) improve child cognitive and psycho-social development; (2) improve child health and nutrition; (3) increase school enrollment at the appropriate age; and (4) reduce dropout and repetition rates in lower primary school.  An important collaborative objective is to improve the human capital potential specifically of poor and otherwise disadvantaged pre-schoolers.  The project consists of two core components: (1) improving ECD worker training, performance, and supervision; and (2) community capacity building, mobilization, and parenting education.  Three pilot interventions will test options to develop cost-effective, replicable models for: (1) improving the financing of ECD services in poor communities by way of community grants; (2) raising nutrition and health standards of pre-schoolers, including those in the particularly vulnerable first three years of life; and (3) smoothing the transition from pre-school to primary school."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":16},"sector5":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"27,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"EP,JA,ET,EC,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,63,65,54,68","mjthemecode":"8,6,8,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":34},{"Name":"Education","Percent":30},{"Name":"Education","Percent":17},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":16},{"Name":"Education","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050103112623","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050103112623","DocDate":"23-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182228","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182228","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200475183","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200475183","DocURL":"07-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145246","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145246","DocDate":"10-MAR-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
