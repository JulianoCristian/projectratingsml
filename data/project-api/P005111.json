The project consists of the following components:  (a) the Greater Cairo gas distribution component to finance the pipeline and related equipment for extending the existing gas distribution system to 235,000 additional households, 5,000 commercial and 22 industrial establishments in Cairo, and displacing LPG, gas oil and fuel oil; and (b) the Trans Gulf gas component to finance gas compressors, gas treatment facilities and the platform template required for the gathering of an extra 70 million cubic feet per day of gas for delivery to the national grid.  In addition, three studies will be performed:  a study to determine an investment plan for the refinery sector addressing the domestic fuel mix imbalance; a Gulf of Suez gas development study to determine an investment plan to address the increased use of shut-in and flared associated gas; and a cost of gas distribution study."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"84,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"45,39,81,84,82","mjthemecode":"11,11,11,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00012505390451","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00012505390451","DocDate":"27-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122450790","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122450790","DocURL":"26-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122450790","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122450790","DocDate":"26-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122450388","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122450388","DocURL":"26-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122450589","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122450589","DocURL":"26-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122450388","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122450388","DocDate":"26-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122450589","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122450589","DocDate":"26-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960930155605","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930155605","DocDate":"03-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930155243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930155243","DocDate":"03-JUN-1991"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
