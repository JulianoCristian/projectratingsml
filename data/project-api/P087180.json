The project is designed to improve the quality of the learning environment, and the relevance of courses in regards to the labor market, and in addition, to establish pedagogic, administrative, and financial management systems in the Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs). Through its two main components, the project will: 1) finance the modernization of the university instruction, relevant to the economy's needs. It will thus facilitate a shift from classic supply-driven programs, to greater focus on science, technology, and demand-driven, occupationally oriented courses, and, from traditional lecture-based instruction, to more emphasis on individual study, and applied research, through course modernization, faculty upgrading, and accreditation; and, 2) implement the new policy framework for higher education as outlined in the Education Sector Development Program (ESDP). The main thrust of the reform is the transfer of autonomy to the University, and other IHEs, in strategic goal setting, budgets, instructional programs, and personnel management. The University and IHEs will operate under performance contracts negotiated with the Government, which will establish institutional objectives under a multiyear institutional development plan, with performance indicators, and agreed-to levels of public subsidy. The University and IHEs will be permitted to generate their own financial resources through training, and consulting services to the public, and private sectors. Additionally, tuition fees for occupationally oriented courses will be introduced progressively in fields such as business management, information technology, and others to be determined."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania!$!MR","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge
