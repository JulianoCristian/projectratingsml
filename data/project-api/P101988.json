There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is construction of Shihutang complex, which is a single integral infrastructure unit consisting of 23 sets of sluice gates, one grade third ship lock, one powerhouse of 120 MW installation capacity, and two sections of connection dam. The second component of the project is flood protection works, which consist of approximately 43km of dikes and 56km of diversion canals, about six sets of pumping stations, two sets of free drainage sluices and two sets of regulating sluices. The third and final component of the project is technical assistance (TA), which consists of two technical studies and a capacity building program which aim to build the institutional and technical capacities of the implementing agency."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
