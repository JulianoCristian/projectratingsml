Building on the previous achievements, the overall objective of this second operation is to continue deepening, broadening, and sustaining the reforms underway in the areas of public administration, and fiscal management. This operation complements a series of the International Development Association (IDA) projects, aimed at strengthening public finance management, raising fiduciary standards, and supporting public administration reform, which are preconditions for a growing share of donors' assistance to be channeled through the budget. The operation also supports the implementation of reforms that lead to a more efficient allocation of fiscal resources in the areas of human development (health and education), and private sector development (investment climate, financial sector, and state-owned enterprises). Notwithstanding, the PSIB Grants have significant country (political, security, and macroeconomic), fiduciary, and implementation risks. The mitigation of these country risks is outside the scope of this project. However, the PSIB Grants will allow the Government to deepen the implementation of its program beyond Kabul, which will contribute to the nation-building effort, and will help mitigate political, and security risks."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"AF","sectorcode":"YZ,FZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Economic management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"22,43,25,27,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,2,4,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","code":"22"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":75},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":15},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20130711151428","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130711151428","DocDate":"25-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000350881_20090723115501","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20090723115501","DocDate":"20-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2006040713423368","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006040713423368","DocURL":"15-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000014464_2006040713423368","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006040713423368","DocDate":"15-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20051121094221","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051121094221","DocDate":"03-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050928093133","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050928093133","DocDate":"08-SEP-2005"}],"countryname":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
