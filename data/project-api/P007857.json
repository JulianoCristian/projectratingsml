The schools would be located in various parts of the country and would consolidate existing small and inefficient schools. The curriculum of the multilateral schools would introduce technical and scientific subjects. The project would also include 33 man-years of technical assistance and 23 man-years of fellowships for local staff in support of curriculum development, teaching of technical subjects and project implementation. The project also seeks to bring about greater government financial support for the education sector, in particular secondary and secondary technical education, as well as the assignment of full-time adequately compensated and trained teachers to all secondary schools. An important aspect of the project will be cooperation with industry to insure the provision of adequately trained personnel to meet industrial manpower needs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Paraguay!$!PY","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PY","sectorcode":"ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de3514_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de3514_1_0","DocDate":"12-DEC-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190219326","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190219326","DocDate":"30-NOV-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903210710","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903210710","DocDate":"30-NOV-1972"}],"countryname":"Republic of Paraguay"}},"facets":{}}
