To meet the short-term traffic requirements of these ports, the project would provide containerized cargo handling equipment at all three ports, as well as bulk coal handling equipment at Huangpu. The project would also include the training of personnel in the operation of the container and coal terminals, and computerized management information systems for container operations. As part of the project, the Government would undertake a containerization study of the hinterlands of the ports of Huangpu, Shanghai, and Tianjin, to identify intermodal terminals, other facilities and transport equipment required to optimize the door to door transport potential of the containerization of cargo through these ports."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u4e09\u6e2f\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u534f\u52a9\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u5bf9\uff08\u5e7f\u4e1c\uff09\u9ec4\u57d4\u6e2f\u3001\u4e0a\u6d77\u6e2f\u548c\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u7b49\u4e09\u4e2a\u6e2f\u53e3\u7684\u8bbe\u65bd\u8fdb\u884c\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6539\u9020\u3002\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6e2f\u53e3\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u8fd0\u8f93\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5411\u4e09\u4e2a\u6e2f\u53e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\u8d27\u7269\u88c5\u5378\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5411\u9ec4\u57d4\u6e2f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6563\u88c5\u7164\u88c5\u5378\u8bbe\u5907\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u4e5f\u5305\u62ec\u4eba\u5458\u57f9\u8bad\uff0c\u57f9\u8bad\u5185\u5bb9\u4e3a\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\u548c\u7164\u70ad\u7801\u5934\u8fd0\u8425\u4ee5\u53ca\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\u4e1a\u52a1\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u9879\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u653f\u5e9c\u90e8\u95e8\u5c06\u5c31\u9ec4\u57d4\u6e2f\u3001\u4e0a\u6d77\u6e2f\u548c\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u8179\u5730\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\u5316\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6e2f\u53e3\u4f18\u5316\u8d27\u7269\u95e8\u5230\u95e8\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\u8fd0\u8f93\u6f5c\u529b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u591a\u5f0f\u8054\u8fd0\u7801\u5934\u3001\u5176\u5b83\u8bbe\u65bd\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd0\u8f93\u8bbe\u5907\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"124,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925102609","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925102609","DocDate":"10-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925102431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925102431","DocDate":"06-OCT-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97444_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97444_1_0","DocDate":"02-NOV-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902403768","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902403768","DocDate":"31-OCT-1982"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
