The project covers five provinces with subprojects spread over 1050 townships in 131 counties in 28 prefectures and cities. There are four main components. Component 1 consists of irrigation and drainage works, mainly small-scale works, including civil works for irrigation and drainage facilities improvement and extension, and secondary and tertiary level canal rehabilitation. The second finances agricultural intensification and support services, including land and soil improvement; provision for more intensive use of organic fertilizer; strengthening production of high quality seeds; improving agricultural extension systems with better facilities, equipment, and staff training; establishing fertilizer blending plants to provide chemical fertilizer; building organic manure digesting pits; providing agricultural production inputs and materials; and promoting science & technology and integrated pest management. Component 3, afforestation and environmental monitoring, increases the vegetative cover as well as controls pests and disease, and provides machinery and equipment. Component 4 supports project implementation and management, and institutional development."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
