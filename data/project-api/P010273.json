For this purpose the project would complete the strengthening and reorganization of the extension services in Punjab and Sind by extending the training and visit system to the remaining 31 districts not covered by the two Phase-I projects (Credits 813 and 922), while at the same time consolidating the gains made during these projects and strengthening the adaptive research system in the two provinces.  To achieve these objectives, the project would include: 1) agricultural extension services (1,600 additional staff and necessary physical components, including offices, staff housing, vehicles and equipment); 2) adaptive research (3 adaptive research farms); 3) staff training; 4) information and media; and, 5) project administration, monitoring and evaluation.  Technical assistance would be provided to support these activities."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"42,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"AR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Research","code":"AR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029215549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029215549","DocDate":"20-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091727","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091727","DocDate":"28-FEB-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36839_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36839_1_0","DocDate":"24-FEB-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36837_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36837_1_0","DocDate":"24-FEB-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926054009","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926054009","DocDate":"27-JAN-1987"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
