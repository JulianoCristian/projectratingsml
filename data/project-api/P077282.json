I t will do so by establishing a strong and coherent policy framework, promoting high-quality and relevant science and technology activities and by supporting key interfaces in the innovation system, especially between the public and private sector as well as international linkages. Second, and subordinate to the first goal, the project will improve the stock of human capital in the Chilean science and technology sector, a development objective which is highly complementary to the establishment of an effective innovation system and per se a critical precondition for establishing a competitive knowledge-based economy. The project development objectives will be pursued through the implementation of three components: (i) improving Chile's science, technology and innovation system; (ii) strengthening Chile 's science base, and (iii) enhancing public-private linkages."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"25,260,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"66","mjthemecode":"8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20120627013340","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120627013340","DocDate":"12-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080303021612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080303021612","DocDate":"26-SEP-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202195864","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202195864","DocURL":"05-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202195864","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202195864","DocDate":"05-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0304150403447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0304150403447","DocDate":"09-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03042504124342","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03042504124342","DocDate":"08-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20030506163539","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030506163539","DocDate":"03-APR-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile"}},"facets":{}}
