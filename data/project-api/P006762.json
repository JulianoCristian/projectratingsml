It will also increase the utilization of installed water production capacity by connecting households with about 1.1 million people to the water supply system and by extending the primary distribution network. In addition, the project will support studies to determine the least cost methods of disposing of Bogota's sewage and reducing flooding and pollution in the Bogota River. About 43 percent of the estimated beneficiaries of the project are expected to be among the poorest 40 percent of the population. The project faces no special risks and, even if the delays and cost increases are encountered, will yield a high return on the investments."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902325411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902325411","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e4a1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e4a1_1_0","DocDate":"15-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e4a0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e4a0_1_0","DocDate":"15-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
