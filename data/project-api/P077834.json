However, major risks are failure to continue the political commitment to the reform process in the Province in light of the October 2002 forthcoming elections; setbacks in the implementation of the Government's reform agenda; and, external shocks arising from a downturn in the economy, including tensions along Pakistani borders. Nonetheless, the Bank's support program is self-adjusting to mitigate the risk of reform derailment."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":11},"theme4":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"TA,BG,JA,EZ,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Human development","Human development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"25,67,65,24,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,1,8,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":60},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20060117171009","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060117171009","DocDate":"19-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20030625115515","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030625115515","DocDate":"19-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202120309","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202120309","DocURL":"10-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202120510","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202120510","DocURL":"10-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202120510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202120510","DocDate":"10-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202120309","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202120309","DocDate":"10-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000094946_02061904011311","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02061904011311","DocDate":"31-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02052404020926","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02052404020926","DocDate":"17-MAY-2002"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
