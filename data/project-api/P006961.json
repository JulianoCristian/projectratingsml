CDB will complement, and eventually supplant, some current Bank roles in the region.  This will enable the Bank, over a 3 -5 year period, to redirect its manpower resources.  Project objectives are : a) to enhance the amount and scope of development and financial services offered to common member countries; b) to strengthen CDB to become a more effective regional development institution; and c) to channel, at a lower cost than the Bank could do directly, IBRD / IDA loan funds to eligible member countries.  In support of this process, the project will : 1) help CDB improve its institutional capabilities; and 2) provide CDB with additional lending resources in support of its lending operations.  In conformity with CDB's recently formulated lending strategy, the Bank's funds will be relent by the CDB in sectors which will make a maximum contribution to the economic development of borrowers for public and private sector projects.  Emergency recovery assistance will also be included."},"country_namecode":"Caribbean!$!6R","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":20},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"6R","sectorcode":"TZ,WZ,YZ,AZ,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44","mjthemecode":"4,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0853e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0853e_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e0853d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0853d_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99b99_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99b99_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928172632","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928172632","DocDate":"26-MAR-1990"}],"countryname":"Caribbean"}},"facets":{}}
