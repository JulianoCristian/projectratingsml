Measures to focus the state on core public functions and raise the efficiency of revenue mobilization have been essential for improving the fiscal fundamentals. Trade liberalization and the deregulation of domestic markets have improved economic efficiency. These reforms have been strongly encouraged and supported by the World Bank. Complementing earlier public sector reforms, the Bank extended two Public Enterprise Reform Adjustment Loans and a Public Sector Reform Loan (1991-92) along with complementary technical assistance loan (1991). The Government is now in the process of reducing the role of public banks and strengthening private banks. To support these reforms the Bank approved the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) in February 1993. This report proposes a Capital Market Development Technical Assistance (CMTAP) Project that will help provide term finance from private sources.

A policy and institutional development program agreed between the Government and the bank will help increase market confidence. A complementary technical assistance loan will finance improvements in the capital market supervision and regulation, including enforcement; training of commercial banks to undertake project financing; and implementation of the new, recently approved pension system.
