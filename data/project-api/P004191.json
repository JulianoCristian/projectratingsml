The project road from Namkading to Savannakhet forms part of the link between the agriculturally-rich southern part of the country and the poorer, northern provinces, and serves as a corridor for export-import traffic.  The road, which is the remaining section of the Vientiane-Savannakhet road to be improved, is now severely deteriorated and passable only during the seven-month dry season and even then with difficulty. The project will also assist the Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC) to begin restoring the capacity of the road network by supporting a study for the establishment of an effective maintenance system as well as emergency spot improvements of key road sections.  Institutionally, the project will help strengthen MCTPC's transport planning capacity and human resources.  The project will finance:  (a) rehabilitation and bituminous surfacing of the Namkading-Savannakhet road, including replacement of six bridges and rehabilitation of 40 bridges; (b) the provision of equipment, materials and supplies for spot improvements; (c) technical assistance for project implementation, preparation of the maintenance study and future roads projects, and transport planning and policy development; and (d) degree courses and short-term training for MCTPC staff."},"country_namecode":"Lao People's Democratic Republic!$!LA","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LA","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,45","mjthemecode":"5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121551411","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121551411","DocURL":"22-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121551411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121551411","DocDate":"22-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e37164_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e37164_1_0","DocDate":"21-MAR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929153628","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929153628","DocDate":"12-FEB-1991"}],"countryname":"Lao People's Democratic Republic"}},"facets":{}}
