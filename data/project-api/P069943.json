The components will: 1) focus on an improved access to, and quality of health, through the refurbishment of primary health care facilities, phasing out civil works, and equipment costs over a five year period. Medical equipment will be replaced, and, additionally required equipment will be procured, such as X-ray equipment, particularly for those communities in need of diagnostic care; 2) improve nutrition of children under the age of two, and of pregnant/lactating women, through extensive training practices, focusing on dissemination of information, education, and communication for better nutrition. A strengthened monitoring system will aim at preventing malnutrition among the target groups, and decreasing the prevailing iron deficiency anemia among young mothers. Functional nutritional literacy will be provided at the household level; and, 3) strengthen the capacity building, through improved management training, evaluation activities, and operational research."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Iran!$!IR","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"87,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"IR","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"63,57,67,68","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090821000128","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090821000128","DocDate":"30-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201455283","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201455283","DocURL":"26-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00041905505768","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00041905505768","DocDate":"03-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00031505340433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00031505340433","DocDate":"29-DEC-1999"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Iran"}},"facets":{}}
