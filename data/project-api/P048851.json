The project consists of three components. First, modernization support to commodities exchanges will facilitate the financing of a range of eligible investments on a cost recovery basis at selected exchanges dealing with grain and cotton. Eligible investment categories are: training and technical assistance, laboratory and information technology equipment, and some civil works. Second, development of trading institutions and strengthening of oversight capabilities will consist of training and technical assistance to a) introduce nationally accepted, and internationally compatible quality grades for wheat and cotton; b) design and initiate the implementation of a warehouse receipt system; c) improve market surveillance and supervision of commodity exchanges; and d) assist in the establishment of a communication network linking commodity exchanges. Third, project impact evaluation will cover trade at participating exchanges, off-exchange trade within the catchment area of participating exchanges; and market integration and price convergence between participating exchanges."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"4,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"BC,YA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"77,39,34,75","mjthemecode":"10,3,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":75},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20031205094756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20031205094756","DocDate":"26-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031815522514","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031815522514","DocDate":"31-JUL-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980728143220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980728143220","DocDate":"22-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929100434","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929100434","DocDate":"24-JAN-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
