The project has five components. The first component strengthens the generic functions of the Ministry to improve the sector: policy analysis and strategic planning; financial planning and management; human resource management; and the design, implementation, and monitoring of specific educational reform programs. The second component is an institution-strengthening component that supports a management information system that will link all branches of the Ministry, including district offices and universities. The third component is also an institution building component as well as a policy reform component. It funds the following activities: improving the current examinations administered at grades 8 and 12; continuing the development and administration of high quality and fair university entrance examinations; determining the learning performance standards to be assessed; and carrying out a sample-based assessment for grade 4. The fourth component develops building and design guidelines and specifications, and rehabilitates schools. The fifth component both procures and publishes textbooks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":37},"sector3":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":18},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other industry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AL","sectorcode":"YW,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,43,25,65","mjthemecode":"8,2,4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":45},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":37},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":18}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050615164242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050615164242","DocDate":"22-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201122262","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201122262","DocURL":"08-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00042605302966","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00042605302966","DocDate":"18-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9912140530495","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9912140530495","DocDate":"29-NOV-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Albania"}},"facets":{}}
