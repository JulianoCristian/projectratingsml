It further involves (ii) upgrading the substations at Aqaba and Amman-South to 400 kV; and (iii) the consulting services associated with (i) and (ii).  The  project will help meet Jordan's future power demand at least cost to the economy and will help the Government to potentially reduce the country's dependence on imported oil by introducing the possibility of substituting oil with coal in Jordan's future power generation should coal prove more economical.  It will also help improve the quality of power supply services and continue institution-building efforts to further develop JEA as a technically efficient entity."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"70,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"JO","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3970311115354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970311115354","DocDate":"06-NOV-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091607","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091607","DocDate":"31-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926043824","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926043824","DocDate":"12-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan"}},"facets":{}}
