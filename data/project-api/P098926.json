The project supports four components, which focus on the use of technology as an enabler to growth and development. While there are many activities which rely on communication and information technology (ICT), in all cases the anticipated results relate to selected improvements o f government's internal functions, its ability to deliver services and information to its citizens, and strengthening of the private sector for economic growth and poverty reduction. There are four project components. The first and third components are primarily concerned with setting the foundation for eGovernment (the basic infrastructure to link the ministries and other government offices, strengthening the Government's district offices, and the underlying computer systems which will form the basis of the operating system). Upon that foundation, component two, which focuses on services for citizens, can be built. Component four is not an application; rather it is a means of building capacity within the Rwandan Information and Technology Authority to undertake a major project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Projet eRwanda</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le projet eRwanda am\u00e9liore : (1) l\u2019efficience et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de certains processus internes du Gouvernement du Rwanda et (2) la fourniture d\u2019applications et de services dans des secteurs cl\u00e9s s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s, y compris par un meilleur acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et l\u2019utilisation de la technologie.
