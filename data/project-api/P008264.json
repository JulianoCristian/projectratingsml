Within the general objectives of Albania's rural poverty alleviation program, the project will test approaches to the implementation of the program during its first year of operations. It will: (a) create the institutional capacity needed for program implementation by establishing the RDF and training a first group of local staff; (b) develop RDF's operational procedures and mechanisms of technical and financial control; (c) evaluate, design, finance, and implement approximately 142 rural infrastructure projects, and establish and fund some 50 village credit funds; and (d) establish and implement, using technical assistance as necessary, training programs to improve local capacity to identify, appraise, and implement small public works projects; the ability of village credit funds to evaluate and administer small loans, and programs to transfer appropriate technology to farmers and small rural entrepreneurs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
