The project consists of three components. First, cadastre and land regularization will support the mapping of the Peten cadastre, in-field adjudication upon demand, and data processing of areas subject to regularization. The end result is the establishment of a parcel-based cadastre that can be integrated with the registry system. Second, the land registry component will support the opening of a registry office in Peten and modernizing registry records management. It also includes office space renovation, office equipment, consultant services, and training. Third, Project Management Unit will finance the implementation management, administration, monitoring, and evaluation of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guatemala!$!GT","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"31,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GT","sectorcode":"BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,33,83","mjthemecode":"11,3,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100722033120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100722033120","DocDate":"30-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080813000849","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080813000849","DocDate":"28-SEP-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201420119","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201420119","DocURL":"27-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9903191053301","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903191053301","DocDate":"10-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903284555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903284555","DocDate":"30-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000012009_20040422102424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040422102424","DocDate":"01-SEP-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guatemala"}},"facets":{}}
