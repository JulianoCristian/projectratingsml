Specifically, dissemination of agricultural technology will be improved, and, the diversification for higher value commodities will be promoted, with good external market prospects, including the use of Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and contract models. The components will include: 1) Strengthening institutional capacity, providing support to the Horticultural Export Development Foundation (HORTEX), to pioneer horticultural production and export activities. The component will provide support to farmers, and private sector development will further increase HORTEX clients in this field. 2) The implementation capacity of the New Agricultural Extension Policy (NAEP) will be strengthened, through partnership agreements, and grants, with the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), and from NGOs, respectively, through extension services provision, and strengthening its monitoring and evaluation effectiveness. 3) Small scale pilot trial and demonstration programs, will be tested regarding on-farm water management, and soil fertility, while farmers will benefit from crop yield forecasting/weather advice."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":48},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"AI,BC,AB,YA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Trade and integration","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"77,85,78,45,48","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"5,5,10,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":48},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000112742_20060719105225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060719105225","DocDate":"07-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030926100258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030926100258","DocDate":"22-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201094251","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201094251","DocURL":"30-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201094452","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201094452","DocURL":"30-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99092506150385","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99092506150385","DocDate":"26-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911063659","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911063659","DocDate":"26-NOV-1998"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
