There are three project components. The first supports the establishment and implementation of the Lesotho Fund for Community Development (LFCD) by pre-testing LFCD operations and procedures in sub-projects in 22 pilot communities; setting up a basic set of operational and financial systems including an accounting and management information system; and financing all recurrent operational costs. The second component trains staff to build the capacity of LFCD and provides technical support to LFCD partner institutions such as community-based organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and private sector firms. The third component strengthens the capabilities of the Bureau of Statistics to collect, process, analyze, and disseminate data for poverty monitoring; and strengthens the quality of program monitoring and poverty analysis."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Lesotho!$!LS","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":38},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":36},"sector3":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":8},"sector5":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"4,670,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"LS","sectorcode":"TZ,AZ,WZ,JB,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"53,71,57,78","mjthemecode":"10,7,9,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":38},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":36},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":8},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100604023745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100604023745","DocDate":"04-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040415125639","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040415125639","DocDate":"29-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201104792","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201104792","DocURL":"19-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00010505302189","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00010505302189","DocDate":"22-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99070105315848","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99070105315848","DocDate":"17-JUN-1999"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Lesotho"}},"facets":{}}
