The project will also attempt to increase the educational systems' equity by ensuring that priority is given in all activities to poor urban and rural areas. The project is comprised of three components. The first is an educational quality component, which will support improvements in the availability of textbooks and instructional materials, competencies of primary school teachers, and curriculum scope, sequence and adaptability. The second component is a modernization of educational administration which will strengthen the management capacity of the education sector at all levels, implement and reform existing budgetary and management functions, develop information management capabilities, and establish a modern student assessment system. The third is an infrastructure improvement component to support the improvement of teaching and learning conditions by rehabilitating and replacing primary school infrastructure in rural and urban poor areas."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":87},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"146,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"ET,BH,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"65,61,51","mjthemecode":"6,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":87},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Education","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02012404004527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02012404004527","DocDate":"27-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200165699","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200165699","DocURL":"07-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200165699","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200165699","DocDate":"07-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200165498","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200165498","DocDate":"07-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200165498","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200165498","DocURL":"07-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200165700","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200165700","DocURL":"07-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200165700","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200165700","DocDate":"07-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d76_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d76_1_0","DocDate":"15-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961007122512","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007122512","DocDate":"28-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007150645","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007150645","DocDate":"14-NOV-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
