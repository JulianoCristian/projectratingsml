The project has three interrelated components.  The first focuses on qualitative renewal and would support the provision of learning and teaching materials and improvements in examination quality and management. The second component consists of rehabilitation and construction of physical facilities in primary schools, which would increase access and improve the education environment. The third is a planning and management component which would strengthen professional and administrative support to teachers and to schools; establish an information management system including a system for maintaining teacher's records; and undertake a series of policy studies that are essential to planning further development of the sector. Project conditionality would ensure increased budgetary allocation to education, while project implementation would buttress Government efforts to involve the non-government sector in education delivery. Given the immense gap between the needed investments in the sector and the resources available, the proposed interventions were selected on the basis of their catalytic impact on education revitalization."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":72},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"ET,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,59,65,78","mjthemecode":"10,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":72},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99032505564829","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99032505564829","DocDate":"22-FEB-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121140380","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121140380","DocDate":"21-JAN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121140179","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121140179","DocURL":"21-JAN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e121ea_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e121ea_1_0","DocDate":"27-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003043351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003043351","DocDate":"29-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003043218","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003043218","DocDate":"28-SEP-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia"}},"facets":{}}
