The Project Development Objectives (DOs) and Implementation Performance (IPS) ratings of  the project  have been satisfactory and have succeeded in improving the rail transit sub sector of the RJMR, decreasing its burden on the State Treasury by eliminating operating subsidies. The additional financing requested by the State is being requested solely to cover a portion of the financing gap due to the devaluation of the US$ in relation to the Brazilian and Korean currencies. With this additional financing loan and the counterpart funds, all contracts will be completed as planned. The State has assured the Bank that it will continue to provide the US$20M in counterpart fund requirements, so that by the end of the project the Bank will finance 67 percent of the project cost instead of the original 50 percent."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de tr\u00e1nsito masivo en R\u00edo de Janeiro </ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"186,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BC,TZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"74,43","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20100108020446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100108020446","DocDate":"24-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20080129013616","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080129013616","DocDate":"28-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980312102318","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980312102318","DocDate":"02-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183617","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183617","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
