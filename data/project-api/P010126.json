Major project components include: the drilling of eight wells and provision of surface facilities at Toot; logistic support (heavy road transport equipment and a cargo aircraft) for OGDC; a seismic survey and reserve evaluation at Dhodak; provision of instructors and equipment for the Oil & Gas Training Institute; and management and accounting consultancy services for OGDC.
