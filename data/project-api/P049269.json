This series of projects shares the objective of supporting improvements in the TRABAJAR program, particularly in the areas of targeting, quality of sub-projects, and evaluation--aspects which have wide applicability to other social programs in Argentina. There are 3 components. The first consists of TRABAJAR sub-projects, which will be presented by municipal and provincial governments, private groups, and national organizations. The menu of projects eligible for financing by TRABAJAR III includes minor construction, repair, expansion, or remodeling for schools, health facilities, basic sanitation facilities, small roads and bridges, culverts and canals, community kitchens and centers, tourist centers, low-cost housing, and community services. The second component consists of project management and supervision costs. The third component evaluates and monitors the TRABAJAR program as well as other employment programs operated by MTSS (Ministry of Employment and Social Security)."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"284,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"BC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"54","mjthemecode":"6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030630122120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030630122120","DocDate":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201403457","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201403457","DocURL":"20-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201403457","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201403457","DocDate":"20-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980709144640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980709144640","DocDate":"08-JUN-1998"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
