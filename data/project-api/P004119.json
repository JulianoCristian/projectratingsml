This will improve water service to about 5 million persons and provide the capacity to serve 1.1 million additional persons by 1991.  The project will extract water from the Han river, upstream of Seoul, to be treated in three treatment plants before distribution to the municipalities. The project includes two water intakes, three booster pumping stations, two treatment plants, some 175 km of pipes (1,000 to 2,400 mm in diameter) and 14 km of tunnels, and construction supervision.  Studies will be carried out to improve the organization of water and sewerage services in the Metropolitan Region, to establish corporate planning within ISWACO and to set policies for bulk water tariffs at a national level."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"95,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925213212","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925213212","DocDate":"09-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925213119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925213119","DocDate":"11-JAN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151655","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151655","DocDate":"31-JAN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904162316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904162316","DocDate":"31-JAN-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
