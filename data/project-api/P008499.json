There are five main components. The first rehabilitates priority sections of national roads by funding civil works to repair road sections; to reconstruct, relocate, or replace bridges; and to build a road bypass. The second component strengthens routine road maintenance by building the maintenance capability of the state road enterprise and road maintenance companies; and finances maintenance equipment and spare parts. The third component strengthens the roads department of a key road maintenance and construction organization by establishing procedures in planning, budgeting, and monitoring as well as in supervising roadworks; training contractors in bid preparation, contract administration, cost control, management, and quality control; and strengthening the road department's training capability. The fourth component improves the enforcement of road transport policies and regulations, improves systems to collect and process data, and develops a more competitive market for inter-city and rural passenger transport services. The fifth component improves road safety."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kazakhstan!$!KZ","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":40},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"KZ","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,39,78,71","mjthemecode":"9,10,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080806004834","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080806004834","DocDate":"31-JUL-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200403573","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200403573","DocURL":"16-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200403372","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200403372","DocDate":"16-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200403573","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200403573","DocDate":"16-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99030406205757","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99030406205757","DocDate":"05-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183808","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183808","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kazakhstan"}},"facets":{}}
