More specifically, the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) is designed to assist the government in responding to the needs of the most vulnerable groups currently underserved by existing programs and institutional mechanisms by: (a) establishing an efficient, demand-driven and complementary mechanism to deliver basic services and infrastructure to the poor; (b) mobilizing and channeling additional resources to the areas of basic social and economic infrastructure and social services; and (c) increasing national institutional capacity to identify, design, implement, manage and sustain small-scale community-based projects. The project consists of two components. The first will finance subprojects approved by the JSIF in the areas of social infrastructure, economic infrastructure, social services, and organizational strengthening. The second component will fund institutional support for the JSIF's establishment and operations, including (i) salaries, vehicles, equipment and operating expenses; and (ii) technical assistance and training to improve the JSIF's operational capacity and procedures."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"JM","sectorcode":"JB,WZ,TA,JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"55,57,78,71","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"9,10,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02060104010560","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02060104010560","DocDate":"05-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200271821","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200271821","DocURL":"02-OCT-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200272022","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200272022","DocURL":"02-OCT-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214135021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214135021","DocDate":"01-AUG-1996"}],"countryname":"Jamaica","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
