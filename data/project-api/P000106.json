Project-financed investments comprise:  (a) the strengthening of (i) the planning and monitoring capacity of the reorganized Directorate of Forests and Natural Resources; and of the National Remote Sensing Center; and (ii) the establishment of poaching control posts in the national parks; (b) the training and education of farmers and public servants, partly through technical assistance; (c) studies, including the preparation of a natural resources management master plan for the Borgou Department; (d) the preparation and implementation of integrated development plans for three natural forests, with local participation; (e) the development of watersheds in four test sites as part of land management operations by local communities; (f) land right surveys on the same watersheds leading to mapping and recording individual and community rights; (g) the implementation of research and development operations on the watersheds and in farmer fields; and (h) wildlife management operations, with the participation of the population, in two areas adjacent to the national parks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":54},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":3},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"14,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"JB,BH,AB,BC,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"80,82,79,77,83","mjthemecode":"11,10,10,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":54},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":31},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00012805311589","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00012805311589","DocDate":"17-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121083254","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121083254","DocURL":"09-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121083555","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121083555","DocURL":"09-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121083555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121083555","DocDate":"09-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121083254","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121083254","DocDate":"09-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e39484_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e39484_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAR-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin"}},"facets":{}}
