The program will contribute to achieving this objective by further developing the regulatory, monitoring and financial framework for fiscal and financial sustainability, labor market efficiency, and trade liberalization. The country shares a common border with the United States, over which more than 80 percent of its exports is exchanged. Millions of Mexican emigrants live in the United States, and prior to the crisis, they sent home over $25 billion per year in remittances. A number of important financial institutions are subsidiaries of international banks that were at the epicenter of the financial crisis. Tourism and other service exports also have the United States as a prime consumer. While the crisis started in the United States, its impact has been more heavily felt in many areas in Mexico. Trade has declined by about 30 percent in the first half of the year. Remittances have fallen substantially, 12.6 percent, in dollar terms, in the first seven months of the year, and foreign investment, direct and portfolio investment, declined by 45 percent in the first half of 2009. The impact of these external factors on the overall economy has been substantial: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first half of the year declined 9.2 percent compared to a year earlier and the Mexican economy lost more than half a million jobs between June 2008 and June 2009."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Credit Reporting and Secured Transactions","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":30},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":30},"theme3":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":10},"theme5":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":10},"totalcommamt":"1,503,750,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Credit Reporting and Secured Transactions"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"YZ,FR,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"49,51,42,27,23","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"1,2,4,6,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Credit Reporting and Secured Transactions","code":"FR"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":57},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":29},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20110809040814","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110809040814","DocDate":"28-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022714415649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022714415649","DocDate":"27-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010081315522466","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010081315522466","DocDate":"03-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20091105001131","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091105001131","DocDate":"22-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000101930_20091023110949","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000101930_20091023110949","DocDate":"22-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090928103045","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090928103045","DocDate":"23-SEP-2009"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
