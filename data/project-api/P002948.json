To that end, the project includes:  (a) adaptive research and extension; (b) agricultural input supply; (c) rural access roads; and (d) management, monitoring and evaluation.  As a result, the project will increase production of food by smallholders, resulting in increased incomes and nutrition. Reductions in transport costs from improvements in rural access roads will reduce the costs of inputs and consumption goods in the area, and increase producer prices through improved access and competition in the food market."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":51},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":24},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"AZ,BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Rural development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"51,78,75,77","mjthemecode":"10,10,10,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":51},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":24},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145535","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145535","DocDate":"04-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031014255466","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031014255466","DocDate":"09-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08232_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08232_1_0","DocDate":"12-JAN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926120755","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926120755","DocDate":"11-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926120612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926120612","DocDate":"11-DEC-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
