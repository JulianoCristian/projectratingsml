Distance Learning will increase the dissemination of the latest technical information and cross-country experience in support of market reforms. Senior public and private sector decision-makers will access interactive multi-media and internet-based training programs developed by the World Bank Institute, major universities, private corporations, and technical organizations around the world. This exposure to global knowledge will enhance the capacity of Sri Lankan decison-makers to conceptualize and implement reforms. Better policies will, in turn, lead to improved governance, poverty reduction, and economic growth. This project has only one component: support for establishing and operating the Distance Learning Company (DLC). The single component includes several activities: 1) selecting and relaying distance learning course material; 2) financing of DLC operating costs on a decreasing basis over the first 4 years of operation; 3) technical assistance for staff training, a market survey, development of a business plan, a market campaign, and periodic evaluation of center operation/management effectiveness; 4) establishing financial accounts/annnual audits; 5) civil works; and 6) purchasing, installing, and maintaining distance learning technology. A center will be built with a videoconference room."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"2,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"EL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48,66","mjthemecode":"8,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20051028104253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051028104253","DocDate":"25-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201184027","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201184027","DocURL":"28-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01021705482743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01021705482743","DocDate":"01-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00072605401573","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00072605401573","DocDate":"09-JAN-2001"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
