The project comprises two related components. The component supports the continuing professional education of China's certified public accountants, and other finance managers and professionals, to familiarize them, on a large scale, with new accounting, auditing, and business administration principles and practices that are generally accepted in market economics. The project helps establish a large residential continuing education facility in Beijing, which offers a wide selection of short courses on specific accounting and business topics and issues. Bank assistance focuses on providing educational and training equipment and materials, designing the curricula, financing of high level trainers who can help build local training capacity, and providing overseas training for trainers. The second component continues support for the government's ongoing effort to develop and promulgate accounting standards that conform to internationally accepted accounting standards. Bank assistance comprises issuing and disseminating standards, developing and publishing new accounting standards and their dissemination to high-level officials, monitoring the application of standards and developing an on-line best practices service for users, and developing a study tour and training program with supporting equipment and training materials."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5236\u5ea6\u6539\u9769\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u9879\u76ee\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bf9\u6ce8\u518c\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5e08\u3001\u8d22\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u57f9\u8bad\u8fdb\u4fee\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u548c\u638c\u63e1\u5e02\u573a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u65b0\u7684\u4f1a\u8ba1\u3001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u7ecf\u8425\u7ba1\u7406\u539f\u5219\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u5efa\u7acb\u56fd\u5bb6\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5b66\u9662\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5404\u79cd\u4f1a\u8ba1\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e13\u9898\u77ed\u671f\u8fdb\u4fee\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3002\u4e16\u754c\u94f6\u884c\u63f4\u52a9\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u57f9\u8bad\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u8d44\u6599\u3001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8d44\u52a9\u57f9\u517b\u5efa\u7acb\u56fd\u5185\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5e08\u8d44\u961f\u4f0d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u5b66\u4eba\u5458\u51fa\u56fd\u8fdb\u4fee\u63d0\u4f9b\u673a\u4f1a\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u7ee7\u7eed\u652f\u6301\u653f\u5e9c\u4ee5\u56fd\u9645\u901a\u884c\u7684\u4f1a\u8ba1\u51c6\u5219\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u53d1\u5e03\u4f1a\u8ba1\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u56fd\u4f1a\u8ba1\u51c6\u5219\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":83},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"30,42","mjthemecode":"4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":83},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100629004043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100629004043","DocDate":"12-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910512074","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910512074","DocDate":"01-FEB-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101336","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101336","DocDate":"16-NOV-1998"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
