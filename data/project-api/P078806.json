Pakistan has borne the brunt of the earthquake, especially 5 northeastern districts of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and three districts covering most of had Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), with enormous loss of life and devastation of infrastructure and property.  In response to the earthquake, the Bank announced that US$20 million would be available to the Government of Pakistan through reallocations from existing projects. This amount was doubled to US$ 40 million on October 11, through additional identified reallocations.  The Bank is preparing a proposed package of US$ 470 million to help Pakistan deal with the reconstruction effort and safeguard the on-going reform and poverty reduction program. This package will include: (1) Supplemental Financing of US$ 150 million under the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 1) and of US$ 50 million under NWFP SAC 2; (2)additional financing for existing projects (AJK Community Infrastructure and Services Project, Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund Project, and Highways Rehabilitation Project); and (3) reallocation of part of the proceeds of AJK Community Infrastructure and Services Project, Second NWFP Community Infrastructure and Services Project, and the NWFP On-Farm Water Management Project. In addition to this immediate response, if the Damage and Needs Assessment identifies unmet needs, and if the Government requests it, the Bank could prepare an Emergency Recovery Program. Even without a formal Damage and Needs Assessment--expected in mid-November-- it is clear that the economic impact of the earthquake is sizeable. Early estimates suggest that the reconstruction costs of the lost infrastructure will run into several billions of US dollars and thus will have a sizeable impact on the overall financing needs of the
