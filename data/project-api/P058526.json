There are three project components. 1) Participatory approaches to drug prevention will promote local solutions to drug use in selected municipalities on a pilot basis via training local community members and sector professionals; training youth leaders; and financing the implementation of the municipal plans for drug prevention. 2) Information systems, monitoring, and evaluation will establish the network to facilitate generation and exchange of information relevant to drug prevention, as well as to carry out the monitoring and evaluation of the project by means of a) a survey-based epidemiological study to obtain information on drug consumption patterns; b) development of prevention methods and training modules that will be disseminated via national, regional, and provincial workshops; c) creation of a network of monitoring centers to strengthen existing institutions focused on drug prevention; and d) monitoring and evaluation of overall project implementation processes. 3) Project management will set up a project implementation unit."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":93},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"4,750,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"BC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"56,55","mjthemecode":"6,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":93},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000094946_02070304061465","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02070304061465","DocDate":"17-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99060411142854","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99060411142854","DocDate":"30-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9903191107408","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903191107408","DocDate":"04-FEB-1999"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
