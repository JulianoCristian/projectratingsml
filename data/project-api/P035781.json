The project consists of four components.  The first component will provide technical assistance and training to develop Savings and Credit Associations (SCAs) in the rural areas of Moldova.  The second component is the establishment of regulatory body of the SCAs, which will provide technical assistance and training to the Rural Finance Project Implementation Unit to temporarily supervise and regulate SCAs, develop the framework for a permanent regulatory body of SCAs, and finance year-end audits of SCAs established under the project.  The third component is the establishment of the Rural Finance Corporation (RFC), which will operate according to agreed prudential rules and an agreed policy manual, specifying RFC's lending polices.  The fourth component will provide a credit line to RFC, who in turn will extend loans exclusively to SCAs operating in the rural areas."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MD","sectorcode":"BC,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"41,40,75,44,77","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,4,10,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02020704004161","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02020704004161","DocDate":"18-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123473636","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123473636","DocURL":"28-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980217140142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980217140142","DocDate":"19-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929095933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929095933","DocDate":"02-DEC-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Moldova","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
