This program document presents a credit to the Republic of Uganda for SDR 65.2 million or US$100 million equivalent to finance the PRSC 9. It is the second of three development policy operations (DPOs) to support Uganda's National Development Plan (NDP) and covers the period 2012-13. The PRSC 9 is prepared under the Joint Budget Support Framework (JBSF). The operation will improve efficiency in four service delivery sectors by addressing common key binding implementation constraints in public financial management (PFM), public service management and public administration, in tandem with sector-specific reforms within health, education, water and sanitation and transport. The PRSC 9 builds upon reforms initiated under the first (PRSC 8) operation of the series and provides the foundation for further reforms supported under the final operation of the series (PRSC 10). PRSC 9 focuses on two policy clusters: 1) reforms in public expenditure management, public financial management and public service management that improve service delivery and 2) value for money in public service delivery sectors. Measures supported by the operation include: improved budget credibility; more transparent and efficient public financial and sector management, focusing on accountability and improved service delivery systems at the local government level that should lead to better quality of education and health services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Neuvi\u00e8me op\u00e9ration \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 en Ouganda</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>L'objectif de d\u00e9veloppement du Neuvi\u00e8me programme du cr\u00e9dit d'appui \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-9) de l'Ouganda est d'am\u00e9liorer l'acc\u00e8s aux services publics et d'augmenter leur rentabilit\u00e9. Ce document de programme pr\u00e9sente un cr\u00e9dit en faveur de la R\u00e9publique de l'Ouganda d'un montant de 65,2\u00a0millions DTS (\u00e9quivalant \u00e0 100\u00a0millions USD) pour financer le programme PRSC 9. Il s'agit de la deuxi\u00e8me de trois op\u00e9rations de politique de d\u00e9veloppement visant \u00e0 soutenir le plan de d\u00e9veloppement national de l'Ouganda et il couvre la p\u00e9riode 2012-2013. Le programme est pr\u00e9par\u00e9 dans le cadre du soutien budg\u00e9taire conjoint. L'op\u00e9ration am\u00e9liorera l'efficacit\u00e9 de quatre secteurs de prestations de services, en traitant des contraintes majeures communes concernant la mise en \u0153uvre de la gestion des finances publiques, la gestion des services publics et l'administration publique, de concert avec des r\u00e9formes particuli\u00e8res \u00e0 chaque secteur dans les domaines de la sant\u00e9, l'\u00e9ducation, l'eau et l'assainissement ainsi que le transport.

Le programme PRSC-9 est ax\u00e9 sur deux groupes de politiques\u00a0: 1) des r\u00e9formes de la gestion des d\u00e9penses publiques, des finances publiques et des services publics qui permettront d'am\u00e9liorer la prestation des services\u00a0; et 2) la rentabilit\u00e9 des secteurs de prestation de services publics. Les mesures soutenues par l'op\u00e9ration sont les suivantes\u00a0: meilleure cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 budg\u00e9taire\u00a0; gestion des finances publiques et du secteur plus transparente et efficace, ax\u00e9e sur la responsabilisation et l'am\u00e9lioration des syst\u00e8mes de prestation de services au niveau du gouvernement local, ce qui devrait se traduire par une meilleure qualit\u00e9 des services de sant\u00e9 et d'\u00e9ducation.</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":10},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":10},"theme5":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Program Document","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"TI,EP,JA,AZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Rural development","Public sector governance","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"70,29,79,27,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,10,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways","code":"TI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":60},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20140227114932","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20140227114932","DocDate":"27-JAN-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081d7e235_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081d7e235_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUL-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b0819d3bd9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0819d3bd9_1_0","DocDate":"12-MAR-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000386194_20120206221107","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120206221107","DocDate":"30-JAN-2012"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
