The following are changes in the Forest Development Project: (i) the project development objectives will be modified to reduce the sector-wide scope of planned interventions; (ii) envisaged support for the establishment of the Forest Sector Business Information Center will be dropped; (iii) support will be provided to design a Forest Geographic Information System as part of the Forest Management Information and Monitoring System (FMIMS); the planned program of forest roads rehabilitation will be scaled back; and (iv) support for private forest owners will be shifted to focus on groups of private owners of the smallest forest holdings, who generally lack capacity or the means for achieving economies of scale in forest management. The project support increased productivity and competitiveness of forest industries, through establishing and operating a Forest Sector Business Information Center (ForsBIC); and build public support for sustainable forest management by implementing a public awareness program targeting key stakeholders with an emphasis on new private forest owners. The project support for the development of a single national standard for sustainable forest management is being dropped, to allow for a diversity of national standards
