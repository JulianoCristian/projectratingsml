The project, which is expected to start commercial production in September 1978, would add about 230,000 tons per year (TPY) of nitrogen to India's fertilizer capacity. It would include all necessary off-sites such as railroad sidings, oil and coal storage and handling, ash disposal, water and effluent treatment, product storage and shipping, maintenance shops, offices and personnel facilities. About 170 of the 200 ha of land needed for the project are being provided by the Uttar Pradesh Government, and 40 ha of contiguous land are being provided by a public trust. Final action necessary for the purchase of the land is expected to be completed shortly. Possession by IFFCO of the necessary land is a condition of effectiveness."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"109,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"IC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","code":"IC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901033997","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901033997","DocDate":"15-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e726a9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e726a9_1_0","DocDate":"07-JAN-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e726a8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e726a8_1_0","DocDate":"07-JAN-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902234133","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902234133","DocDate":"31-DEC-1974"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901161992","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901161992","DocDate":"31-DEC-1974"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
