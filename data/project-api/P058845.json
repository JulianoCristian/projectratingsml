The components will: 1) expand highway capacity through the construction of the Taihe-Ganzhou Expressway (TGE), partly traversing mountainous areas, to serve Ganzhou, the province second largest city, and, substantially reduce travel distances to Guangdong Province. TGE construction includes tunnels, interconnecting roads, toll stations, and service/rest areas, as well as equipment supply. Furthermore, a management, and maintenance center, and monitoring centers will be included, in addition to electrical/mechanical facilities for telecommunications, lighting, and monitoring activities; 2) include a road improvement program, designed to help people in poor counties, increase their income, through better access to product markets, employment opportunities, social services, and facilities. This program will improve forty roads sections, and eight selected sections located in four counties. Performance indicators include average daily traffic, availability, and cost of bus services, number of days the road is closed/non-available, number of school children, number of people visiting hospitals/clinics, and, increases/decreases in the County per capita income; 3) enable highway safety, through safety measures at roadwork sites, safety audit checklists, and a pilot project to identify hazardous locations; and, 4) restructure institutional framework to adapt to the changing economic, and competitive environment in China. It includes studies on organizational changes, supply of equipment, and, related training programs. Land acquisition will take place, thus resettlement issues are further discussed in the Resettlement Action Plan."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
