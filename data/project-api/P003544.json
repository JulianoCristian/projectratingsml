The project components include: (a) increasing the number of complete schools by increasing multigraded classes; (b) providing free textbooks to very poor children; (c) reducing repetition rates; (d) improving resource management; (e) improving quality related school inputs such as library books and teaching aids; (f) improving the qualifications of teachers; and (g) increasing the share of investment resources for poor and disadvantaged small villages. To assist in the process of restructuring of higher education, the project supports pilot projects in selected universities that are attempting to improve efficiency through internal reorganization and mergers. The restructuring includes rationalization of departments to reduce narrow specialization and to provide broader courses that increase the flexibility of graduates. Finally, to improve planning and management of county education bureaus, the project supports adoption of the software already developed in China to collect and analyze data on teachers, students, infrastructure and resources."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
