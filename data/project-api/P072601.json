There are two project components. The first component provides a general line of credit through the Rural Development Fund (RDF II) and funds micro-finance (MLF). The first is a fund at market interest rates, available through the Bank for Development and Investment of Vietnam (BIDV) to accredited participating financial institutions (PFIs) on a short-, medium-, or long-term basis to finance rural investments of farm households and private rural entrepreneurs that are economically and technically viable. A fund lent by BIDV to MFIs at mareket rates would form the MLF, which will provide finance for working capital and small capital investment of micro-finances and individual poor people. This comprises the second sub-component. The second component also has two sub-components. They consist of strenghtening the BIDV's financial performance, particularly increasing the quality of its loan portfolio; diversifying income sources, widening interest rate spreads, and improving operational effectiveness to increase profitability; mobilizing medium- and long-term VND resources; equity build-up; staff training; and improving management information systems and internal control systems. The second sub-component strengthens PFIs and MFIs, which institue their own respective institutional development plans."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"FE,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"39,43,77,44,75","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,4,10,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":85},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20111025022713","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20111025022713","DocDate":"25-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022612122687","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022612122687","DocDate":"09-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02052010133034","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02052010133034","DocDate":"02-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02041104093759","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02041104093759","DocDate":"05-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01033006014411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01033006014411","DocDate":"28-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0110030409434","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0110030409434","DocDate":"24-JUL-2001"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
