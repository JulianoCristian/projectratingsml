It intends to also open a new route of transport (Volta Lake) of petroleum products to the north and enable the distribution of diesel and kerosene to outlying/remote areas mainly to facilitate movement of agricultural products. The proposed project comprises several components including (a) completion of the ongoing rehabilitation of the Tema Refinery of GHAIP; (b) rehabilitation of GHOIL's bulk petroleum storage depots located at Takoradi and Kumasi; (c) rehabilitation of GOIL's existing network of retail outlets; and (d) expansion of infrastructure. Further to this, the project involves (e) provision of storage tanks and transfer facilities at Akosombo and Buipe; (f) provision of oil jetties; (g) provision of transport vehicles; and (h) provision of facilites for farmers' services reseller outlets. Lastly, the project provides (i) project engineering and management assistance, a computer facility and training."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"GS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","code":"GS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029215404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029215404","DocDate":"28-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120294376","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120294376","DocURL":"21-SEP-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120294577","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120294577","DocDate":"21-SEP-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120294376","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120294376","DocDate":"21-SEP-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120294577","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120294577","DocURL":"21-SEP-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36c3a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36c3a_1_0","DocDate":"11-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36c38_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36c38_1_0","DocDate":"11-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926061220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926061220","DocDate":"20-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
