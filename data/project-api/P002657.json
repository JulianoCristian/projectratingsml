The project will also include detailed engineering of the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road and the Mafutseni-Mliba Road. The main beneficiaries will be direct road users, but benefits will be widely distributed among small farmers, traders and consumers. The project faces no special risks, although it is possible the Central Transport Organization will not improve its operations quickly enough to adequately maintain the equipment required by the Roads Branch, or that the Roads Branch's training program will not improve road maintenance operations to the extent originally planned."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Swaziland!$!SZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SZ","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e38b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e38b_1_0","DocDate":"05-SEP-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902310913","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902310913","DocDate":"31-AUG-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912393940","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912393940","DocDate":"31-JUL-1978"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Swaziland"}},"facets":{}}
