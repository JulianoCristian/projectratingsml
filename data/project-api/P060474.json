Its development objective is to ensure the sustainable management of the National System of Protected Areas (SNAP) by establishing and strengthening: a) legal, institutional, and policy frameworks; b) management capacity at the protected area and central levels; and c) SNAP finanacing mechanisms. Phase I will also identify the gaps in representativity of Bolivian ecosystems within the current protected areas, and propose adjustments to SNAP to expand its coverage to all relevant ecosystems. There are five project components. The first aims to strengthen the regulatory agency's policy, planning, and management capacities, and its ability to operate autonomously. The second component aims to strenthen the planning and managment capacities of the protected areas, and increase local participation and inter-institutional coordination. The third component prepares and approves the Protected Areas law, and amends cross-sectoral laws and regulations. The fourth component establishes and capitalizes a dedicated trust fund to provide recurrent cost financing for protected areas. The fifth component consolidates and complements ongoing efforts in resource managmeent and monitoring in protected areas and their buffer zones."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":58},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":41},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"BG,AZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"33,82,80,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,11,11,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":58},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":41},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070209103950","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070209103950","DocDate":"18-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051915571297","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051915571297","DocDate":"16-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051915590198","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051915590198","DocDate":"16-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01010505342443","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01010505342443","DocDate":"20-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9903191105376","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903191105376","DocDate":"24-NOV-2000"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
