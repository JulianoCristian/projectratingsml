The changes will include: (i) replacing the definition of 'MOE' with 'MoES' which means the recipient's Ministry of education and sports, (ii) moving school feeding into community grants component, since the current allocation under goods is making it difficult to get food to schools; (iii) adding six highly disadvantaged districts as part of the FTI school feeding program (the education indicators for these districts show very low enrolment rate, especially for girls and ethnic children); and (iv) reallocating US$2.7 million from category one (goods, works, consultants' services, incremental operating costs and training and workshops) to category three (community grants)."},"country_namecode":"Lao People's Democratic Republic!$!LA","sector1":{"Name":"Primary
