To meet this objective, the project has three sub-goals: (1) to increase the quantity and quality of cross-sectoral economic policy studies for government use; (2) to establish the BEA outside of but accountable to government, for an objective, economy-wide perspective in assessing economic policy options, and (3) to improve the reliability of the national accounts as a basis for sound economic analysis. The project will finance three components: (1) Policy studies- for local and international consultants, and to obtain data to use in medium-term policy studies focused on macroeconomic analysis and public finance, social policy, and enterprise economics and financial sector reform; for production of the annual report, quarterly indicators, and quick-response policy notes, and for databases to support these initiatives; (2) Bureau of Economic Analysis- for the technical and human resources needed to increase capacity for economic policy analysis both in the BEA and in the core economic ministries, including computer and information technology, a library, on-line databases, and training, study tours, and fellowships; and (3) Improvement of national accounts- for computer equipment, training, and technical assistance needed to improve the quality of economic statistics."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Analysis of economic growth","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"22,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Rule of law","Economic management","Economic management","Economic management"],"themecode":"22,20,23,34,21","mjthemecode":"1,3,1,1,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Analysis of economic growth","code":"20"},{"name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","code":"22"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183103","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183103","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200312997","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200312997","DocURL":"18-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200313098","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200313098","DocURL":"18-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200312997","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200312997","DocDate":"18-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200313098","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200313098","DocDate":"18-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102811","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102811","DocDate":"14-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
