To achieve this objective, the project will: 1) help improve the business and investment environment by decreasing policy constraints; 2) strengthen institutions supporting the private sector; 3) enhance the dialogue between the private sector and the government; and 4) alleviate problems associated with inadequate know-how and the weak financial system. There are several beneficiaries from this project. First, the project will enhance the competitiveness of individual enterprises directly. Second, other stakeholders will benefit from serving as a means to this end. Finally, the government of Uganda will come closer to realizing its stated goal of building a modern, self-sustaining economy, based on free enterprise. The project consists of four mutually reinforcing components: 1) shaping the business environment: the private sector foundation component; 2) enhancing know-how through markets: the \"business Uganda\" development scheme component; 3) enhancing know-how through financial partners: the equity financing component; and 4) enhancing know-how through industrial partners: the investment promotion and facilitation component."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":53},"sector2":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"12,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Capital markets"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"BC,FK,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,41,45,40","mjthemecode":"4,5,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":53},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":33},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030709120252","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030709120252","DocDate":"26-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123381458","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123381458","DocURL":"30-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123381659","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123381659","DocDate":"30-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123381458","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123381458","DocDate":"30-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123381659","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123381659","DocURL":"30-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e23f67_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23f67_1_0","DocDate":"14-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23f66_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23f66_1_0","DocDate":"14-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019144720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019144720","DocDate":"06-NOV-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
