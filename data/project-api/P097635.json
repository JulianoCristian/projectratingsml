There are four project components. Component 1 consists of two subcomponents that focus on sector policy, and legal, regulatory and safeguards advice. Specifically, it supports legislation, including any required amendments, to facilitate the proposed transaction through to financial closing by preparing legal and contract documents, legal opinions, etc., and prepares a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment specific to energy sector development; develop terms of reference for an Environmental Impact Assessment, Social Assessment and the Resettlement Action Plan; prepares an environmental baseline monitoring toolkit and collect field data; outlines the needs for institutional strengthening and capacity building to assess, monitors and regulates the environmental impacts of mining and power generation; and provides training to staff in relevant ministries. Component 2 supports Mine and Power Plant Analyses, specifically, an investment options review; and second, a new power plant development and technical analysis. This will complement previous studies on mine and power plants and compile adequate information and analysis for bidders; it will also develop a knowledge base for decision makers in Kosovo to economically and efficiently solicit, evaluate, and negotiate proposals for private development of the Sibovc lignite resource. Subcomponent 3 provides technical assistance to help the Ministry of Energy and Mining (MEM) develop policies and strategies to promote renewable energy, cogeneration and energy efficiency in Kosovo.
