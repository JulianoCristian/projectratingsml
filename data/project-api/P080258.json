The project has been restructured in August 2009, December 2010, and March 2011. Since then it successfully launched activities that enabled the commercialization of research results and research capacity and increased the ability of small and medium sized companies to invest in research and development activities. The project rating is satisfactory. The project will close on May 31, 2011, and proposed reallocation is necessary to optimize the use of funds until the project closing date.
