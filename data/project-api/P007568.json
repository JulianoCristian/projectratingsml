The Mexican share of the international waters will be utilized for promoting intensive agriculture through improved drainage, water management, land leveling and extension programs. The project will improve drainage in 60 percent of the project area and water management over the entire areas covered by the two irrigation districts. The project will directly benefit 15,459 farm families, of which 14,770 have holdings between 5 and 50 ha each.
