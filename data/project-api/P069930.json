It is crucial to complete the rehabilitation of the road which connects the Port of Djibouti with neighboring Ethiopia, which fully depends on the Djibouti port for all foreign maritime trade, and for the massive and recurrent shipments of food aid to millions of Ethiopians. The supplementary financing is needed to cover higher than expected costs for physical road rehabilitation works, and ultimately to allow the existing International Road Corridor Rehabilitation Project to reach its original development objectives. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Djibouti!$!DJ","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":2},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":40},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Paper,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"DJ","sectorcode":"BH,JA,BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,39,47,88","mjthemecode":"8,5,4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000011823_20060221112840","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000011823_20060221112840","DocDate":"09-FEB-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050410490257","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050410490257","DocDate":"20-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000160016_20030506152604","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030506152604","DocDate":"02-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00050305305088","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00050305305088","DocDate":"03-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030409220558","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030409220558","DocDate":"30-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052111202242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052111202242","DocDate":"30-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0006130535035","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0006130535035","DocDate":"01-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00061005355085","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00061005355085","DocDate":"31-MAY-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Djibouti"}},"facets":{}}
