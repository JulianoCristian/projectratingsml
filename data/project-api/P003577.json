The project consists of three components: (a) Tongling cement production and distribution; (b) Zhongguo cement plant rehabilitation; and (c) technical assistance. The Tongling component will implement a regional cement production and distribution scheme, which involves installation of a cement plant at Tongling, and construction of a clinker grinding at Ningbo to process clinkers to be shipped from Tongling. This component will be supported by a river and coastal bulk transport system which includes a loading terminal at Tongling, bulk carriers, a clinker receiving terminal at Ningbo, and bulk cement receiving terminals at Nantong and Wenzhou. The Zhongguo component involves replacing wet-process cement production units by a dry-process cement unit in order to improve efficiency and product quality and to expand production capacity of an existing medium-scale cement plant. The technical assistance component provides financial and technical support to strengthen four cement industry research and design institutes and a study to improve the efficiency and emissions of small-scale cement plants."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
