There are five project components. The first finances civil works for health centers and district hospitals, re-equipping newly constructed or rehabilitated health facilities; and carries out studies, trains personnel, provides medicines; supports supervision activities, decentralized health administrations, sanitation activities; and helps maintain buildings, equipment, and vehicles. The second component finances transport and other logistical expenditures, drugs and insecticides, equipment, studies, and training to diagnose, prevent, treat, and monitor malaria, tuberculosis, plague, and schistosomiasis. The third component funds information, education, and communication efforts to improve reproductive health service delivery; training to raise standards in health interventions like child survival and safe motherhood; and prevention campaigns to improve STD/HIV/AIDS services, particularly among prostitutes and other groups at risk. The fourth component provides a package of institutional strengthening and child treatment support to enable the health ministry to enhance the effectiveness of nutrition programs and to develop a multi-sectoral operational nutrition information system. The fifth component finances reform by improving sector coordination; increasing service coverage, financial access, and equity; and enhancing efficiency."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"MG","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"68,57,67,64,69","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,8,8,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080729234516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080729234516","DocDate":"16-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000021321_2005111113152061","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005111113152061","DocDate":"13-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2005111113152061","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005111113152061","DocURL":"13-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000090341_20050610110449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050610110449","DocDate":"25-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201101877","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201101877","DocURL":"03-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99120105303285","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99120105303285","DocDate":"04-NOV-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Madagascar","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
