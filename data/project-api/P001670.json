There are five components in this project.  First, expanding access to secondary education comprises all civil works activities related to the construction of day secondary schools.  This component will finance all school facilities, furniture and equipment, library furnishings, teachers' housing, playing fields, roads, etc.  Second, quality of secondary education will provide instructional materials in the project-financed schools.  For all other public conventional schools, this component will provide textbooks, school supplies, and coonsumables for sciences.  Third, efficiency and effectiveness of secondary education will provide training for school-based managers.  The credit will also finance establishment of a small training unit, procurement, and other monitoring activities. Fourth, the HIV/AIDS materials component will finance the rapid adaptation of high-quality, behavior-change instructional materials from Zimbabwe, and the reprinting of some of materials.  Fifth, support to administrative unit/monitoring & evaluation/studies will cover the costs of procurement and a computerized financial management system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"48,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Agreement,Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"JA,BC,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,61,65,88,78","mjthemecode":"10,8,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2010102715141513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010102715141513","DocDate":"29-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100225014649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100225014649","DocDate":"29-JAN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060727135653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060727135653","DocDate":"28-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121310216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121310216","DocDate":"17-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121311417","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121311417","DocURL":"17-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121310216","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121310216","DocURL":"17-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121311417","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121311417","DocDate":"17-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110802","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110802","DocDate":"25-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185438","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185438","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
