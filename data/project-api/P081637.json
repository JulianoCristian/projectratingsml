The medium-term program balances a strategy of  private sector-led growth while reducing social exclusion and increasing empowerment to ensure wide participation in growth. The program consists of  five complementary pillars: 1) Sustaining structural reforms in the enterprise sector with emphasis on privatization and restructuring of  the energy, railway, telecommunications, and water sectors; 2) Establishing a market-friendly business environment, focusing on reducing entry constraints, accelerating exits, securing deregulation and reducing regulatory costs, improving the delivery of  public services to business, and improving the competitive environment, through continuing labor market reform; 3) Deepening the financial sector, improving the legal framework for lending, completing banking reform, and developing financial markets ; 4) Improving public sector governance, strengthening public administration capacity, improving service delivery, reducing corruption, strengthening accountability and transparency, strengthening public expenditure management, and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of  the judicial system; and  5) Investing in human capital and strengthening social programs, improving quality, access and efficiency in education and health, continuing pension reforms, increasing social assistance effectiveness, providing for better integration of  the disabled and reducing institut"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BG","sectorcode":"JA,EZ,FZ,YZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Human development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,42,65,27,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,8,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":15},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20051109100645","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051109100645","DocDate":"04-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2004102118015878","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2004102118015878","DocURL":"17-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2004102118015878","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2004102118015878","DocDate":"17-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20040518100546","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040518100546","DocDate":"04-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000094946_03050704115792","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03050704115792","DocDate":"08-JAN-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Bulgaria","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
