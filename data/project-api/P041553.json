The project will provide additional financing to complete the public enterprise privatization work in the agriculture and financial sectors and enlarge the scope of privatization. Furthermore, the project's objective of establishing a transparent institutional framework will help accelerate the overall privatization program. Finally, the project will prepare the groundwork for the next adjustment sector operation (The Enterprise Reform and Divestiture Credit) scheduled for FY97. More specifically, the project objectives are to: 1) put in place an adequate and transparent institutional framework for privatization/liquidation and implement a broad privatization program; 2) improve the regulatory and business environment in a limited number of well targeted areas complementary to the privatization program; 3) reorganize the loan recovery agency and support the restructuring of two banks; and 4) provide preliminary support to the judiciary to initiate a program of reforms over the next few years. To achieve these objectives, the project will consist of the four following complementary components: 1) privatization and liquidation, which will provide consultant services and basic equipment; 2) restructuring of two banks and the loan recovery agency; 3) preliminary support to improve the private sector environment; and 4) strengthening of the judiciary providing the Ministry of Justice the necessary support."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cameroon!$!CM","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":47},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"12,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"CM","sectorcode":"CT,BG,FA,BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,33,34,43","mjthemecode":"4,3,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":47},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":26},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":14},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01081004024285","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01081004024285","DocDate":"29-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123410678","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123410678","DocURL":"23-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123410678","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123410678","DocDate":"23-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961029234403","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029234403","DocDate":"22-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cameroon"}},"facets":{}}
