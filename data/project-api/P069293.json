There are three project components. The first component stimulates a national dialogue on policy changes needed for health reform in Azerbaijan; generates support in the Government for the reform process itself; introduces a common understanding of terms and objectives such as productivity and cost-effectiveness; performs critical assessments related to health financing reform; and strengthens capacity in the health ministry to plan, implement, and evaluate health reforms by developing a management information system, and by developing new pharmaceutical policies and procedures. The second component implements a number of reforms that have been previously piloted by UNICEF in Azerbaijan: the rationalization of health care services; the implementation of primary health care models; the improvement of and access to primary care services; and the strengthening of managerial and clinical capabilites of health personnel. The third component supports the project coordination unit and a monitoring and evaluation program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Azerbaijan!$!AZ","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":73},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AZ","sectorcode":"BK,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Rural development","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"67,89,78,93","mjthemecode":"8,10,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":73},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070430110043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070430110043","DocDate":"30-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20060710150909","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060710150909","DocDate":"01-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201221164","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201221164","DocURL":"25-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060704034846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060704034846","DocDate":"16-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0011080538307","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0011080538307","DocDate":"23-MAR-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Azerbaijan"}},"facets":{}}
