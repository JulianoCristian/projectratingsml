The project consists of two components: a national component and a ports component.  The national component will: 1) establish baseline data on international ship traffic, related waste types and quantities through a pilot interport ship waste monitoring system (SEATRACK); 2) prepare a comprehensive accident (oil pollution) contingency plan for each port; 3) initiate a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) monitoring program for the Yellow Sea; 4) undertake a study of the treatment of chemically contaminated water; 5) upgrade environmental monitoring capabilities at the ports, coastal waters and international waters; and 6) provide consultant's services and training.  The port's component will: i) define, design, and provide land-based collection and disposal facilities at the ports of Dalian, Tianjin, Shanghai, Ningbo, Xiamen and Guangzhou; and ii) upgrade environmental monitoring and enforcement capabilities of each of the port authorities."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
