The project consists of the following parts: Vegetable seed components cover facilities for the production, supply and certification of high quality vegetable seeds. These components will include (i) establishment of a seed farm on reclaimed land to the west of the Delta; (ii) assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture's Seed Certification Agency; and (iii) assistance to the Vegetable Research Institute to strengthen research and breeding capacity for breeder and foundation seeds. The drainage component consists of (i) sealing the lining of the Nasr Canal, the main irrigation canal in the NSPC area, and (ii) construction of a 67 km drainage outfall in West Nubariya, to collect drainage water from the seed farm project area and from the surrounding reclaimed lands. Horticultural development components provide storage, transport and packing facilities for four public sector institutions engaged in production, import and export of potatoes, citrus fruit, and other crops."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Annual crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Annual crops"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"AQ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Annual crops","code":"AQ"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925003911","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925003911","DocDate":"28-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902262557","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902262557","DocDate":"31-MAY-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101911193513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101911193513","DocDate":"31-MAY-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b820_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b820_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAY-1976"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
