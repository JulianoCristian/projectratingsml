Through a multi-sectoral approach, the project objectives will support the implementation of Niger's Strategic Framework for the Fight against STIs/HIV/AIDS for the period 2002-2007. The development objective of both the National Program, and this operation are to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS, mitigate the adverse impacts of the disease, and, strengthen capacity to formulate, manage, implement, monitor and evaluate a cost-effective HIV/AIDS program, attained through a multi-sectoral approach, drawing on comparative advantages, and partnerships among both public, and private entities. Within its components, the project will support strategic orientations to scale up, expand, and improve prevention activities, through the treatment, and care of local populations, and activities to mitigate the impoverishment effects of the epidemic, as well as strengthen the national capacity to implement the multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS program. To this end, prevention, care, and mitigation activities will be financed through line Ministries, to attain a strong health system (that includes tuberculosis prevention, and care), through the provision of education, training, and improved access to treatment, intensified by the civil society response, and community-based initiatives. Capacity building and further training activities for the public sector, and civil society agencies should foster effective management of preventive, and treatment activities. Project management activities will support technical assistance, program coordination, and administration, and, facilitate the multi-country AIDS program's strategic management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Niger!$!NE","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"NE","sectorcode":"BH,BC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"55,57,67,69,88","mjthemecode":"8,8,8,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":35},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100113233224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100113233224","DocDate":"23-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000020439_20070618105330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070618105330","DocDate":"29-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20070514104035","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20070514104035","DocDate":"14-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201371217","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201371217","DocDate":"14-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03032104003071","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03032104003071","DocDate":"18-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01071304250450","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01071304250450","DocDate":"17-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02102204203349","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02102204203349","DocDate":"17-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02110604072872","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02110604072872","DocDate":"31-DEC-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Niger"}},"facets":{}}
