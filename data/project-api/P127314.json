The GSGDA emphasizes the need for macroeconomic stabilization, greater public sector efficiency and executive transparency and accountability to provide the adequate setting for the reduction of poverty and socio-economic inequalities through agricultural, private sector, infrastructure and human resource development. Specifically, the PRSG8 supports continuing and deepening policy reforms initiated in 2009 to: (i) restore budgetary discipline and financial stability and (ii) foster public sector reform and strengthen sustainability in the energy sector, while (iii) protecting the poor, and (iv) developing the oil and gas institutional framework. The proposed operation is aligned with the World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY08-121 and with the World Bank's strategy for Africa."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Don \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSG-8)</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Cette deuxi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re Op\u00e9ration de politique de d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019une s\u00e9rie programmatique de deux cr\u00e9dits (PRSC-7 et PRSG-8) soutient les efforts des autorit\u00e9s pour consolider la stabilisation fiscale en cours et maintenir les objectifs de d\u00e9veloppement d\u00e9finis dans le programme de d\u00e9veloppement et de croissance partag\u00e9e du Ghana pour 2012-2013.
