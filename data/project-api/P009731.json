About 40,000 mostly small growers would benefit from the project. The project entails no unusual risks. The development of the managerial capability of the Jammu-Kashmir Horticultural Produce Marketing and Development Corporation (JKHPMC) - a new entity - will be critical for successful project implementation. Appropriate safeguards have been provided in the project to ensure that the management capability of JKHPMC is built up as quickly as possible. It will also be important to formulate proper marketing arrangements for the apple juice concentrate component of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"14,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924194702","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924194702","DocDate":"21-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902300510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902300510","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081df56e6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081df56e6_1_0","DocDate":"08-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228bcf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228bcf_1_0","DocDate":"08-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228bce_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228bce_1_0","DocDate":"08-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228bcd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228bcd_1_0","DocDate":"08-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912380392","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912380392","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
