The project includes the construction of three hyroelectric power plants, rehabilitation of existing diesel engine generating plants, extension of subtransmission and distribution facilities, a loss reduction program, a training program and engineering/consultant services. The project will reduce the country's dependence on imported fuels by about 34,500 barrels of fuel per year, resulting in foreign exchange savings equivalent to US$1,300,000 annually.  It will supply a reliable and efficient source of power for the country's development."},"country_namecode":"St. Vincent and the Grenadines!$!VC","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"VC","sectorcode":"PY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","code":"PY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007193259","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007193259","DocDate":"02-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c2d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c2d_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c2b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c2b_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c2a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c2a_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190244297","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190244297","DocDate":"30-APR-1984"}],"countryname":"St. Vincent and the Grenadines"}},"facets":{}}
