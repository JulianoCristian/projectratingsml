The environment in Budapest will be improved by the diversion of heavy commercial vehicles from the city to the motorway (M-O) by-pass. There are three components : a railways component, a Hungarocamion (Hungarian International Freight Company) component, and a highways component. The railways component will provide computer aided wagon and locomotive control systems, as well as freight and financial management systems, a recycling plant for old rails, and track maintenance and construction machinery. For Hungarocamion, an integrated and computerized information system, and handling equipment for transit distribution stores will be financed. The highways component will involve the construction of the second segment of the new, four lane Budapest bypass, engineering supervision and project management, a program of periodic maintenance of national roads, and a motorway emergency call system. The project will also provide a traffic information and control system for the Budapest Transport Company, and a technical assistance component for training in the computerized management information systems."},"country_namecode":"Hungary!$!HU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"95,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HU","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022112954","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022112954","DocDate":"31-JAN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042814543847","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042814543847","DocDate":"29-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040512130349","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040512130349","DocDate":"10-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042011395648","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042011395648","DocDate":"10-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042910541950","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042910541950","DocDate":"10-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042910575652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042910575652","DocDate":"10-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042910560351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042910560351","DocDate":"10-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927021837","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927021837","DocDate":"02-MAR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927021619","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927021619","DocDate":"01-MAR-1989"}],"countryname":"Hungary"}},"facets":{}}
