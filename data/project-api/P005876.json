It provides for (i) construction of a wellfield; (ii) further renovation and expansion of the water distribution network; (iii) management assistance and staff training of the Public Water Corporation (PWC) for carrying out hydrogeological studies; and (iv) a leak detection and repair program.  Increased availability of potable water in metropolitan Aden would help improve the sanitary and health conditions of the city's population.  The network expansion would be mainly in low-income districts where under the project about 83,000 residents, who now obtain their supply from standposts and water vendors, would be served by individual house connections.  As part of the project, further strengthening of the sector organization and the PWC will take place."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019133637","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019133637","DocDate":"19-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095838","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095838","DocDate":"31-OCT-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36bbc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36bbc_1_0","DocDate":"30-OCT-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36bb7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36bb7_1_0","DocDate":"30-OCT-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
