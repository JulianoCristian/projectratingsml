Further objectives call for public sector reform, which the project will address through decentralization and private sector initiatives. Social and rural development strengthening, will be reinforced through expansion of small-scale and coastal fisheries development. The project contains two main components, as follows: 1) strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Marine Fisheries (MOMF) to manage and develop the fisheries sector. This component includes institutional reforms, supporting decentralization and organizational restructuring, in addition to an administrative reorganization. The decentralization process will improve with the inclusion of an integrated management information systems, providing computer equipment and technical assistance. Furthermore, major sectoral planning will include monitoring and coordination of future fisheries development, and will support the creation of the Unit for Women's Advancement, quantifying the role of women in the sector; 2) pilot marketing development will support the fishing fleet upgrade, and improve landing conditions. In addition, marketing and processing conditions will also be improved."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":52},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":18},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":8},"sector5":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"YB,AJ,YA,BC,TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,79","mjthemecode":"10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":52},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":18},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":14},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":8},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20090825093330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20090825093330","DocDate":"29-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99042805371941","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99042805371941","DocDate":"13-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000425962_20121113170213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000425962_20121113170213","DocDate":"13-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173822","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173822","DocDate":"06-OCT-1998"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
