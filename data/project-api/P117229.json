This single tranche development policy operation (DPO) will help the Government of the Union to consolidate recently-achieved gains with respect to political stability and democracy. It will also support the authorities' efforts to engage firmly on a reform program to enhance macroeconomic stability and address core economic distortions so as to provide the basis for economic development, better service delivery and poverty reduction. It addresses axis one, on economic stabilization and equitable growth, emphasizing improvements in government and fiscal operations; as well as axis three, on strengthening governance and social cohesion. It is also a central component of the new interim strategy note (ISN) for FY10-12, and squarely aligned with its second objective of strengthening state capacity and accountability. Finally implementation of the reform program will also be supported by a technical assistance project that is at an advanced state of preparation and has been extensively discussed with the authorities in conjunction with the proposed development policy operation."},"country_namecode":"Union of the Comoros!$!KM","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":10},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":70},"totalcommamt":"3,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"KM","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,24,25","mjthemecode":"2,1,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20130917163115","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20130917163115","DocDate":"17-JUL-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011061512120310","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011061512120310","DocDate":"15-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"090224b081af4c27_2_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081af4c27_2_0","DocDate":"14-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.2","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20101020035859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20101020035859","DocDate":"11-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100507014204","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100507014204","DocDate":"03-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100614091400","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100614091400","DocDate":"11-JUN-2009"}],"countryname":"Union of the Comoros"}},"facets":{}}
