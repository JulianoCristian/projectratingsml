At its eastern end this expressway will connect with another new expressway being constructed from Petare to Guatire; in the west it will be eventually extended to join the Caracas-La Guaira highway. The project would also provide for consulting services for supervising construction of the expressway; and for services of experts to assist in a study of road-user charges in metropolitan Caracas."},"country_namecode":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela!$!VE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"VE","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912404624","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912404624","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67e82_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67e82_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903142910","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903142910","DocDate":"31-MAY-1969"}],"countryname":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela"}},"facets":{}}
