Investments would be in grain storage and mechanization for grain production in the remaining 3-year period of the current Five-Year National Development Plan. Investment in on-farm storage and mechanization would be all in the social sector, including State and cooperative farms. Investment in off-farm storage would be carried out by the Grain Trust, the State agency for grain marketing. Minor expenditures for technical assistance in grain handling, mechanization study tours, development of a management information system for major sub-borrowers, an agricultural price policy study and future project preparation would also be financed under the project."},"country_namecode":"Hungary!$!HU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"130,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HU","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925173312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925173312","DocDate":"30-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e999c0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e999c0_1_0","DocDate":"14-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e999bf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e999bf_1_0","DocDate":"14-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e999be_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e999be_1_0","DocDate":"14-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902423081","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902423081","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901021338","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901021338","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"}],"countryname":"Hungary"}},"facets":{}}
