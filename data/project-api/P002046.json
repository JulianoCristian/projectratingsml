Support services would include improved farm and water management practices, extension advice, crop protection measures, weed control improved seeds, fertilizer, and the provision of small-scale pump irrigation on the fadama lands. Forest nurseries would be established for on-farm and commercial planting programs. Physical infrastructure would include constructing about 1,440 km of feeder roads, drilling about 1,000 boreholes, rehabilitating about 1,000 wells, and establishing project headquarters and farm service centers. Consultant services would be engaged to assist in recruiting a project management team and to carry out studies of adaptive research, intermediate technology, rural water supply planning, training and staff development, and the project's socio-economic impact. Since the basic agricultural package is simple and well tested, the project does not involve unusual risks."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"142,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000178830_98101911523279","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101911523279","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924211341","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924211341","DocDate":"18-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925055918","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925055918","DocDate":"31-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e97661_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97661_1_0","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9765f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9765f_1_0","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912510347","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912510347","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902372663","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902372663","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
