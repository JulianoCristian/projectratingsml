The changes are aimed at overcoming a funding shortfall for investments under component A (Water Supply Infrastructure and Equipment), which are critical to attain the project objectives. As agreed and requested by the Government, the restructuring will entail: 1) optimization of the scope of investments to reduce component A costs; 2) reallocation of US$400,000 from the 'consulting services' category to the 'works' category; 3) mobilization of US$500,000 in additional co-financing by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic (GKOR); and 4) adjustments to the Result Framework for more accurate capture of progress towards project objectives. With the above measures, the project should complete water supply rehabilitation investments in most of the planned villages, and will more substantially achieve its objectives."},"country_namecode":"Kyrgyz Republic!$!KG","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Public administration- Water,
