The project will enhance energy efficiency and energy conservation and reduce environmental pollution by enabling disconnection of about 34,000 flats in Sarajevo from self-made gas connections. The project consists of the following major components: 1) a technical assistance component, especially needed for: (a) project management; (b) engineering; (c) financial and commercial management; and (d) system planning; and 2) a reconstruction component which includes: (a) boilers; (b) distribution network; (c) substations; (d) remote control center; (e) internal building installations; and (f) metering. In Sarajevo, the major components will be: 1) technical assistance which will be used for project management, including an engineering survey and assessment, and for staff training, master plan and tariff studies; and 2) investments for the reconstruction all of parts of the district heating network, including building internals. In Banja Luka, technical assitance will be used for project preparation (engineering survey and assessment) only."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"}],"docty":"Technical Annex","countrycode":"BA","sectorcode":"LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,74,81","mjthemecode":"11,9,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961019220552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019220552","DocDate":"30-APR-1996"}],"countryname":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}},"facets":{}}
