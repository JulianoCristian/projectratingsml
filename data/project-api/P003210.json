The project will finance community initiatives which assist the poor and vulnerable to meet their own objectives during the adjustment period and thereby allow faster economic and social recovery. The community-based micro-projects will include the rehabilitation and improvement of existing infrastructure and social service delivery. The project will also improve the capacity of communities and government staff to plan, appraise, manage and maintain investment projects through the experience gained in such micro-projects. The project will also enhance the capacity of Zambian institutions to collect and analyze poverty related data. The beneficiary communities will be involved in the information gathering as well as in the planning, design and implementation of the micro-projects. The project will strengthen the communities' abilities to take charge of their own development, rekindle the spirit of self-help, and strengthen the capacities of the relevant institutions to gather, analyze and act on relevant information. In order to achieve its objectives the project will have three components. The first is a community initiatives component which will finance microprojects identified, prepared and implemented by communities with appraisal and supervision from the Microprojects Unit (MPU); a sub-component will finance capacity building in microprojects implementation and decentralized government agencies. The second component will finance capacity building and data collection through a Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and a systematic participatory monitoring and assessment system. The last component will finance policy relevant research on poverty an"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"BC,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,61,41","mjthemecode":"4,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":75},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01060704034948","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060704034948","DocDate":"09-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121270282","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121270282","DocDate":"18-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121270081","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121270081","DocDate":"18-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121265880","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121265880","DocDate":"18-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121265880","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121265880","DocURL":"18-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23ef1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23ef1_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23d9f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23d9f_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e23d9e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23d9e_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e23d9d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23d9d_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008023740","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008023740","DocDate":"05-JUN-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia"}},"facets":{}}
