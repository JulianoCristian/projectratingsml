There are 3 components. The first comprises the project works to be undertaken during the construction phase of the concession. They entail re-building, operating, and maintaining existing roads; constructing a new highway; and establishing and managing a natural reserve of sub-Andean forest to offset the project's environmental impact. Road improvements include an asphalt concrete overlay and improvements to sections in critical condition due to recurring landslides and drainage deficiencies; tunnels, bridges, and viaducts; and repaving works needed to maintain the level of service along the road network assigned to the concessionaire and to build the infrastructure needed to collect tolls and operate the natural reserve along the Rio Negro. The second component comprises 1) all the studies and services needed to develop and manage the project, finalize the engineering designs, and assure quality control of construction and operation activities during the pre-construction and construction phases; and 2) external supervision services to be hired to oversee the execution of the concession contract. The third component comprises project expenditures related to construction that are needed to mobilize private financing."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"137,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,71,44","mjthemecode":"4,9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000094946_0111160402131","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0111160402131","DocDate":"31-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200385907","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200385907","DocDate":"04-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200385706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200385706","DocDate":"04-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200385907","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200385907","DocURL":"04-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200385706","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200385706","DocURL":"04-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980709144721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980709144721","DocDate":"11-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183944","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.4","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3981005100317","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3981005100317","DocDate":"31-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3981005100315","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3981005100315","DocDate":"31-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3981005100314","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3981005100314","DocDate":"31-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3981005100312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3981005100312","DocDate":"31-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.5","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3981005100323","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3981005100323","DocDate":"31-MAR-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
