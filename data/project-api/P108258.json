The ambitious goal of this government-wide initiative is to make all government services accessible to the common man (citizen) in his locality, through common service delivery outlets and ensure efficiency, transparency and reliability of such services at affordable costs to realize basic needs. NeGP was approved in May 2006 as a national program, coordinated at the cabinet level, to replace an ad hoc array of e-governance initiatives across individual agencies and states that had developed throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The program is expected to have significant social benefits for the poor through expanded access, and improved citizen engagement in e-services. GoI recognizes that the uneven progress of NeGP has not been primarily due to funding constraints or the absence of specific investments, but rather to cross-cutting policy and coordination issues at a program level. The development objective of the proposed series of DPLs is 'to increase access to online services by citizens in their localities.' thus supporting a major part of the NeGP's overall goal. It will assist the government do this through supporting policy and institutional actions that constitute a higher emphasis on coordination in the NeGP, and increased outreach to citizens."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":41},"sector2":{"Name":"Information technology","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":19},"sector4":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":10},"theme2":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Information technology"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Summary of Discussion,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"FA,BH,CA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"29,30","mjthemecode":"2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Information technology","code":"CA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":41},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":33},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20130405113745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130405113745","DocDate":"25-MAR-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081af4942_2_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081af4942_2_0","DocDate":"10-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000356161_20110405001632","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110405001632","DocDate":"31-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20110307002209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110307002209","DocDate":"02-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000020953_20110427091117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20110427091117","DocDate":"27-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000003596_20110209102230","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000003596_20110209102230","DocDate":"08-FEB-2011"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
