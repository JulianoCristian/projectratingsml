The project will support these objectives under three components aimed at: 1) implementing an effective and modern legal, regulatory and supervisory framework, in line with international standards, across the banking, insurance, and securities markets, so as to improve financial intermediation and risk-taking behaviors, and, foster a more efficient mobilization of savings; 2) restructuring weak public financial institutions, particularly in addressing their stock of non-performing assets, and streamlining their role and activities in the financial sector; and, 3) developing as needed the financial sector infrastructure in modernizing the payments system, improving the integrity of the financial sector through better anti-money laundering policies, and, enhancing the quality of financial information in upgrading accounting and auditing standards. However, main risks could include a slowdown of the reform momentum, to a path that would not allow for a genuine move towards market-based, risk-taking business patterns in the specialized public banking institutions (moral hazard issue). This is of particular concern to the restructuring of the Credit Agricole du Maroc, the pace of this restructuring, and, the burden-sharing of costs."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance"},{"Name":"Capital markets"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"FK,FD,FG,FA,FZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,43,34,42","mjthemecode":"4,3,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","code":"FG"},{"name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","code":"FD"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":35},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":25},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":15},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":15},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000386194_20120810015847","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120810015847","DocDate":"26-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080501234925","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080501234925","DocDate":"28-JAN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2006021616131148","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2006021616131148","DocURL":"16-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2006021616131148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2006021616131148","DocDate":"16-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20051129100543","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051129100543","DocDate":"17-NOV-2005"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
