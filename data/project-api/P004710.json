The expansion of lignite production at Mae Moh mine is required to meet the incremental demand of the Mae Moh power generating facilities up to and including the 150 MW Unit 4 scheduled to be commissioned by January 1984. Production will need to increase from 1 million tons of the run-of-mine lignite in 1979 to 2.8 million tons per year in 1984. The project scope for the Mae Moh lignite mine includes the engineering, procurement and erection of mining and related equipment, technical assistance, training and civil works. The mining equipment comprises four 15 cu yd electric rope shovels, thirty four 85 t rear end dump trucks, one coal crushing, conveying, stacking and reclaiming system, and ancillary equipment. The project also includes expansion of the maintenance workshop and office and the mine power supply system."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"72,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"NN","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining","code":"NX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","code":"NN"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924232801","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924232801","DocDate":"08-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924232720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924232720","DocDate":"30-APR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902352518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902352518","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e961aa_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961aa_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e961a9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961a9_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912475699","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912475699","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
