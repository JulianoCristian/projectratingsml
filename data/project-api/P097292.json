The main objective will be to finance imports, critical to the recovery of investment and production; counterpart funds will be transferred to the approved budget, and thereby contribute to the financing of the Government's poverty reduction strategy. However, among the major risks is the impact of the crisis, which may be larger than anticipated, placing continued pressure on imports, such that investment, production, and exports may fail to recover quickly; that the next agricultural season may also be affected by adverse weather conditions which may undermine an economic recovery."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Technical Annex,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"LZ,CT,AH,YA,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"52,23","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"1,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":25},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":10},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070731155558","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070731155558","DocDate":"12-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000021321_2006040713594893","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2006040713594893","DocDate":"12-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2006040713594893","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2006040713594893","DocURL":"12-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000012009_20050829093024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050829093024","DocDate":"15-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20050818093038","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050818093038","DocDate":"17-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20050816093900","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050816093900","DocDate":"15-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20050811160308","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050811160308","DocDate":"11-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20050805100806","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050805100806","DocDate":"30-JUL-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
