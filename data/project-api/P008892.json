It also includes the establishment of two new types of institutions, namely a Management Training Institute at Gebze near Istanbul to provide short courses in business administration for middle and high level managers, and six Adult Training Centers. The latter will be located in the industrialized areas of the country and provide employable skills to immigrants coming from rural to industrial areas and also assist in reducing their problems of adjustment to an industrial environment. Technical assistance is also included in the project in the form of fellowship abroad and services of specialists to assist the above institutions in implementing new curricula, introducing new teaching methods and modernizing educational equipment production techniques."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"13,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912593118","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912593118","DocDate":"28-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903205694","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903205694","DocDate":"31-MAY-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a671_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a671_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAY-1971"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
