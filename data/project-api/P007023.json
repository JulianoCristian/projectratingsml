There are two main components : educational development and management development. The educational development component would : a) provide skills upgrading in key subject areas and teaching methods for some 600 teacher training staff of normal schools and universities and related in-service training for 10,000 public primary school teachers; b) initiate a system for maintenance of primary school facilities based largely on community inputs of labor and government financing of materials; and c) provide equipment for, and studies to evaluate, improve and expand an ongoing school nutrition program in rural areas and initiate a similar program in peri-urban areas. The management development component would : i) strengthen management information, planning, and monitoring for primary education based on school planning criteria and socio-economic indicators; ii) support selected studies on issues related to the future development and financing of basic education; and iii) introduce a student assessment system to monitor achievement in language, mathematics, social studies, and science."},"country_namecode":"Dominican Republic!$!DO","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":23},"sector4":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DO","sectorcode":"EP,JB,BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,68,65,55","mjthemecode":"6,8,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":35},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":31},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":23},{"Name":"Education","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980804142835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980804142835","DocDate":"24-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122445885","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122445885","DocURL":"13-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122445885","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122445885","DocDate":"13-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001020611","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001020611","DocDate":"23-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001020132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001020132","DocDate":"23-MAY-1991"}],"countryname":"Dominican Republic"}},"facets":{}}
