Under the project, sewage treatment plants will be constructed or expanded in Pusan and Taejon, Korea's second and sixth largest cities.  The project will include construction of:  (a) the first phase of Yongho sewage treatment plant in Pusan, with a daily maximum capacity of 340,000 cubic meters per second, a sewage pumping station and about 11.4 km of interceptors to carry sewage to the plant; and (b) the second phase of Wonchon Dong treatment plant in Taejon and 11.9 km of interceptors, to double existing capacity on completion.  Technical assistance will also be provided to:  (i) help supervise treatment plant construction; and (ii) update the cities' Sewerage Master Plans (SMPs), including a review of policies and management systems for sewerage activities and design of a program to convert the sewer systems from combined-type systems, carrying both stormwater and wastewater, to hygienically superior separate systems which carry wastewater in sanitary sewers and stormwater in storm sewers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sewerage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"WS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,85,74","mjthemecode":"9,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165944","DocDate":"16-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122493715","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122493715","DocURL":"21-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122493614","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122493614","DocURL":"21-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122493916","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122493916","DocURL":"21-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122493614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122493614","DocDate":"21-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122493715","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122493715","DocDate":"21-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122493916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122493916","DocDate":"21-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001222938","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001222938","DocDate":"31-JAN-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
