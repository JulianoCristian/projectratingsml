FONEI will provide medium and long term financing to industrial enterprises through the commercial banking system to help finance machinery, equipment and other fixed assets for projects which will improve Mexico's balance of payments by increasing exports of goods or services or by substituting imports efficiently. The Bank loan will finance the foreign exchange component of FONEI's financing over a period of about two years."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912383649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912383649","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902303658","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902303658","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
