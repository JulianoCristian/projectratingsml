Specific project objectives are to assist the poor to: (1) improve sustainable management of natural resources through soil conservation measures and reforestation at the micro-catchment level; (2) increase rural production and productivity through introduction of irrigation and improved agricultural practices; and (3) strengthen their rural organizations so that they can become autonomous and sustainable entities.  The project has four components: (1) participative identification and formulation of rural investments in micro-catchments; (2) rural investments; (3) strengthening of rural community institutions; and (4) logistical support and training to the implementing agency (PRONAMACHCS)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and
