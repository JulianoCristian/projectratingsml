This would be accomplished through rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance (O&M) of the Bangladesh Water Development Board's (BWDB) existing flood control, drainage and irrigation projects. The project's objectives would be achieved through: (a) rehabilitation and improvement of about 80 subprojects which have deteriorated due to inadequate maintenance; (b) introduction of improved O&M in BWDB's projects where infrastructure still is in reasonably good condition, but not maintained properly; (c) on-farm development works and improved O&M in two subprojects with farmers' participation; (d) training of BWDB staff and beneficiaries, particularly for O&M; and (e) provision of technical assistance to assist BWDB in planning, design and execution of rehabilitation, improvement, on-farm development and O&M works and to help strengthen its organization for O&M and staff development. The World Bank Food Programme (WFP) would provide food to finance part of the construction and maintenance of earthworks to be carried out under the rehabilitation and improved O&M components."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":64},"sector2":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":36},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"53,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Flood protection"}],"docty":"Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"WD,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,59,57,78","mjthemecode":"10,7,7,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":64},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":36}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123260656","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123260656","DocURL":"23-MAR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123260857","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123260857","DocDate":"23-MAR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123260857","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123260857","DocURL":"23-MAR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123260656","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123260656","DocDate":"23-MAR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e084b0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e084b0_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928062951","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928062951","DocDate":"06-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928063116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928063116","DocDate":"06-FEB-1990"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
