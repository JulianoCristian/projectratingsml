An independent regional regulatory authority is to be established and new sector legislation is to be passed in each country in the course of project effectiveness. There are three project components. First, telecommunication regulatory framework modernization will provide technical assistance and training, support institutional arrangements, implement changes, support monitoring and audit, introduce new telecommunications legislation, establish a coherent and comprehensive licensing regime, and set up a regional regulatory authority. Second, pilot for informatics training will support a wide variety of training, implement institutional arrangements, and monitor the actual results of the training component. Third, project management will finance the administrative costs of the Project Management Unit residing in the OECS Secretariat."},"country_namecode":"Organization of Eastern Caribbean
