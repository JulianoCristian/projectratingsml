Specifically, it supports the commercialization of the road sector, strengthens the operations of the Department of Highways, helps preserve road assets, and improves competition and transparency in the award of contracts. The project implementation progress for activities is near completion, the project is rated unsatisfactory due to slow procurement process for activities under the additional financing. All civil works have been completed with the remaining fund of US$441,283 under this category. All periodic maintenance works were completed by September 2011 and the International Procurement Consultant (IPC) has been hired since March 9, 2011. The only remaining activity is Consultancy for the Design of Performance-Based Contracts (PBC), estimated at US$350,000."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Rural and
