In the highland area of the subprovince, 6,000 farm families would receive the benefits arising from improved roads, markets, water supplies, agricultural credit, and intensive extension services. Production of maize, wheat and livestock would be increased by the use of improved seed, fertilizer, implements, working oxen and dairy cows which would be provided on credit. Earnings on existing coffee production would be increased through improvements in quality brought about by better processing. In addition, two areas in the savanna zone which now contain 700 farms, would be reorganized and expanded to accommodate the resettlement of 1,050 farm families from more densely populated areas."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"3,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903162753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903162753","DocDate":"31-OCT-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da56ec_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da56ec_1_0","DocDate":"21-OCT-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903203864","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903203864","DocDate":"08-OCT-1969"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
