This reform program is critical to the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) strategy to create fiscal space for priority social and investment spending and increase the growth potential of Jamaica. The FS DPL1 will also support the maintenance of macroeconomic stability while the GoJ adjusts to the deterioration in the global environment while continuing to implement the longer term reform agenda for fiscal and debt sustainability. The FS DPL1 supports actions to: (a) promote fiscal sustainability through control of overall public sector balances and debt generation, and rationalization of public bodies; (b) improve the efficiency of public financial management and budget process; and (c) strengthen the tax administration capacity, reduce tax distortions and enhance the efficiency of the tax system. The Government has made progress on these key components of its reform program, even in the context of the ongoing global economic crisis."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":8},"sector5":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":30},"theme3":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":30},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"JM","sectorcode":"EZ,AZ,FZ,JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Economic management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"21,28,27,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,2,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":68},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":8},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":8},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":8},{"Name":"Education","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20121126222857","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121126222857","DocDate":"27-SEP-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2010081315435811","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010081315435811","DocDate":"25-FEB-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20100211023615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100211023615","DocDate":"08-FEB-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100219132436","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100219132436","DocDate":"23-JAN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100217140825","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100217140825","DocDate":"12-JAN-2010"}],"countryname":"Jamaica","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
