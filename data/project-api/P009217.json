To this end, the project consists of a line of credit to LBL to finance subprojects for (a) energy conservation and substitution in industry; (b) energy audits; (c) the domestic production of energy-saving material or equipment; and the (d) development or expansion of proven substitute local energy resources.  As part of the project, technical assistance is  provided to: (a) technical enterprises to promote the domestic capability in energy auditing techniques and for consultancy services for energy audits of more complex subprojects; and (b) to assist LBL in upgrading its capabilities, with emphasis on investment analyses, management information systems and supervision.  The  project will make a direct contribution towards reducing energy imports in Yugoslavia, as well as improving the competitiveness of the exporting beneficiary enterprises."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other finance","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"FY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other finance","code":"FY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019170812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019170812","DocDate":"01-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091852","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091852","DocDate":"31-MAR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165528","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165528","DocDate":"31-MAR-1987"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
