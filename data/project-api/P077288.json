There are three components to the project: 1) Capacity building would be the main component, where the execution of an assessment is unusually technical in nature. Any one of a number of small mistakes can cause serious delays in implementation and, in the worst case, lead to meaningless findings. Therefore, a high-level technical assistance, including the services o f a senior Technical Advisor, would be required to monitor and assist in all aspects of both central and provincial operations. 2) Pilot experiments will be required to determine what will produce the desired, valid results, and what process is most implemented. 3) Information dissemination. Through this component, the project will facilitate information dissemination about assessment to stakeholders in advance of the actual assessment to explain its purpose and to provide insight and reassurance about its intended uses."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"3,630,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"65","mjthemecode":"8,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":75},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100129000256","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100129000256","DocDate":"22-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004092715165548","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004092715165548","DocURL":"09-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050614434150","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050614434150","DocDate":"09-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004092715165249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004092715165249","DocDate":"09-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004092715165249","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004092715165249","DocURL":"09-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004092715165548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004092715165548","DocDate":"09-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03042304090899","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03042304090899","DocDate":"08-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20030514141756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030514141756","DocDate":"07-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0304230411359","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0304230411359","DocDate":"15-APR-2003"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
