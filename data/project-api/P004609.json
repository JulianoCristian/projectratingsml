This will be achieved by: a) improving existing infrastructure; b) improving access to the area for industrial, commercial and passenger traffic; c) maintaining the SBF asset base, including protection of the environment; and d) strengthening the capacity of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) to manage and administer the facility. The project consists of three components. The first is the site improvement, which includes improvement of land access; airport improvements; port repairs; a pilot standard factory building development; and the provision of miscellaneous equipment for security and maintenance purposes. The second component is technical assistance and training to strengthen the institutional capacity of the SBMA and to provide appropriate systems for the implementation of freeport policies. The third is environmental protection, which includes the carrying out of an environmental baseline survey, the provision of monitoring equipment and institutional support to establish a sound environmental infrastructure at the SBF."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Aviation","Percent":31},"sector2":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":19},"sector4":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":16},"sector5":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Aviation"},{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"TA,TZ,BH,TP,TV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,82,73","mjthemecode":"9,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Aviation","code":"TV"},{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":31},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":16},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00041905432564","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00041905432564","DocDate":"22-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123035344","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123035344","DocURL":"03-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123035445","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123035445","DocDate":"03-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123035344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123035344","DocDate":"03-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123035445","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123035445","DocURL":"03-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99e06_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99e06_1_0","DocDate":"02-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e99e05_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99e05_1_0","DocDate":"02-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005215004","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005215004","DocDate":"10-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005214717","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005214717","DocDate":"10-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
