It will: 1) provide additional resources for programs targeted at the poor; 2) promote a new approach to rural development by involving communities in project preparation and implementation, while encouraging government agencies, non-governmental organizations and private institutions to assist communities when needed; 3) support a district level program of labor-intensive construction to be targeted at the poorest districts as a safety net operation; and 4) strengthen the poverty monitoring and assessment system through financing a poverty monitoring support facility (PMSF). The PMSF will support poverty reduction policies and programs by bridging poverty-related gaps and developing analytical skills in government and private institutions. The project will have the following three components: 1) community subprojects including an information, education and communication (IEC) campaign to inform communities and other participants about the demand-driven processes of the project; 2) public works program which will finance a safety net operation in poor and food-deficient areas through labor-intensive public works constructing, rehabilitating and maintaining economic infrastructure; and 3) poverty monitoring support facility, which will finance capacity building in institutions to coordinate, collect, analyze, disseminate and use data relevant for poverty reduction policies and programs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"56,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"JA,WZ,BH,EP,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,51,56,78","mjthemecode":"10,6,6,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":40},{"Name":"Education","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02072304021213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02072304021213","DocDate":"27-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121281822","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121281822","DocURL":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121281822","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121281822","DocDate":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121281923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121281923","DocDate":"15-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022110923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022110923","DocDate":"12-APR-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
