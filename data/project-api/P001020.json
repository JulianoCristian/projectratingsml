The expansion of the OFAB infrastructure involves the provision of a waiting basin in the port and further dredging, the lengthening of railway passing loops, heavier rails, and extensions to the Kamsar townsite and hospital. The total cost of these works will amount to US$12.9 million equivalent, of which the Boke - UNDP Technical Assistance loan of US$9.0 million will cover the foreign exchange component. The estimated local costs of $3.9 million can be met from the original USAID loan, under which adequate uncommitted funds remain available."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other transportation","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other transportation"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"TY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other transportation","code":"TY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191207146","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191207146","DocDate":"11-MAY-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903185594","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903185594","DocDate":"30-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a7ae_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a7ae_1_0","DocDate":"22-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a7ad_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a7ad_1_0","DocDate":"22-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a4c4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a4c4_1_0","DocDate":"22-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a4bd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a4bd_1_0","DocDate":"22-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903324367","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903324367","DocDate":"31-MAY-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000356161_20111226024917","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20111226024917","DocDate":"28-MAY-1971"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
