The project is composed of six components: 1)a technology and institutional development component, consisting of: a) rural extension encouraging a new form of agricultural extension that modifies the current product-focused extension, towards one focused on the microcatchment productivity systems in which families and rural communities actively participate; b) rural associations which have financed selective administrative and managerial equipment and consultant services; and c) agro-ecological mapping at the microcatchment level in soil classification and land use planning, and resource information; 2) an adaptive agricultural research component, which finances of specialized services, infrastructure, field equipment, and inputs for research trials, and incremental operating costs;  3) an incentive program for natural resources management and conservation component, which finances: environmental education, an incentives fund for soil management and conservation and pollution control, an incentive for recovery of degraded lands, reforestation, and enforcement of the soil use law and of project incentives; 4) an erosion control works in the rural roads component, an integral part part of the microcatchment interventions, consisting of minor reshaping of road profiles, with shoulder remodeling, various drainage and erosion control works, and road regraveling; 5) training and dissemination; and 6) project coordination and administration."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Tercer proyecto de gesti\u00f3n de tierras - Sao Paulo</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":27},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":26},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"55,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"JB,TA,BZ,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"85,83,57,84,79","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,11,7,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":42},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":27},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":26},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090810003013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090810003013","DocDate":"01-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123150176","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123150176","DocURL":"07-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123150176","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123150176","DocDate":"07-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123145975","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123145975","DocURL":"07-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123145975","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123145975","DocDate":"07-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171127","DocDate":"30-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172513","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
