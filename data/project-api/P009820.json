It consists of construction and start-up of facilities for an open-pit mine in the Singrauli coalfield in the States of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, and would provide equipment and necessary infrastructural facilities to establish a production level of 5 million tons per annum. The project will also support institutional development of CIL in open-pit mining procedures, project management, budgeting and cost control. It will address important sectoral issues, related producer-consumer linkages, and coal transportation and distribution. The project faces minimal technical and marketing risks. Any possible financial risk is mitigated by GOI's commitment to a pricing policy which ensures the continued financial viability of CIL."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"151,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"NN","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining","code":"NX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","code":"NN"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007223253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007223253","DocDate":"01-FEB-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e998d6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e998d6_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e998d4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e998d4_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902435238","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902435238","DocDate":"29-FEB-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
