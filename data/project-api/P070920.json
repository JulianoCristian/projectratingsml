The project is the first phase of the regional Program, covering Ethiopia, and Kenya, who have met the eligibility criteria for accessing funds under the MAP, developed comprehensive multi-sectoral strategic plans for the medium term, and endorsed the principle of public/private partnerships, to implement their national strategies, and assume overall program coordination. Each individual country project operation has their own specific development objectives, but provide the basis for this program. The program for Ethiopia will finance the Government's 2000-2004 HIV/AIDS strategic plan, that include support for capacity building within, both private, and government agencies. Prevention, care, and treatment activities will also be financed, to expand the public multi-sectoral response of civil society, and communities to the AIDS epidemic. The Kenya program will intensify the fight against AIDS, supporting five priority areas, that include prevention, and advocacy, treatment and support of the continuum care of AIDS affected people, management, and coordination, and mitigation of social impact, through research, monitoring, and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":63},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":23},"theme4":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"BC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,69,88,54,63","mjthemecode":"8,6,8,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":63},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070509095903","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070509095903","DocDate":"11-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00070706145866","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00070706145866","DocDate":"29-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201160716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201160716","DocDate":"12-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201160716","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201160716","DocURL":"12-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201160615","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201160615","DocURL":"12-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201160615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201160615","DocDate":"12-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00082605465154","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082605465154","DocDate":"14-AUG-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
