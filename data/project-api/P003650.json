The first and largest of the two components, the Tuoketuo thermal power plant and associated technical assistance, includes construction of the first two coal-fired subcritical thermal units in Inner Mongolia, the power station's first phase; technical assistance to the Tuoketuo electric power company for accounting and management systems; and a desertification control and dryland management program to improve environmental conditions. The second component includes construction of two indoor substations at Xibianmen and Xizhimen, the addition of a third transformer in an underground substation currently under construction, and technical assistance to the North China Power Group Company for implementing accounting and financial management systems."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
