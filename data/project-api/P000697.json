It will upgrade existing settlements containing about 8,800 households by providing basic services and house improvement loans, and will also develop about 4,500 new plots for self-help housing construction and community facilities, 1,500 plots for mixed residential and commercial/industrial uses, and 250 business plots is small industrial zones. Technical assistance and credit for establishing small enterprises in the industrial sites and business plots are expected to be provided under a proposed fourth development finance company and small scale enterprises project which was appraised in February 1979.
