Its strategic focus is on two key sets of objectives: sustaining high and shared economic growth, and expanding the effective delivery of basic services through the government budget. There are two closely interrelated and overlapping sets of risks for this operation. The first set includes general risks that may interfere with the successful implementation of the MKUKUTA, including the vulnerability of Tanzania's economy to external shocks, political risks related to the situation in Zanzibar, aid dependence, decentralization, and capacity constraints. The second set of risks could undermine the overall credibility of the general budget support (GBS) process - and PRSC - as an effective means to channel resources towards the achievement of the MKUKUTA objectives. The operation supports the significant progress that has been achieved by government in improving the institutional and financial set-up in the energy and transport sectors, and in the area of governance, through the enactment of a new anti-corruption and a new audit bill. The proposed credit, together with other partners' budget support contributions, sustains the government in funding its basic services and infrastructure development needs, while strengthening the country's own financial management and budgetary delivery systems."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Tanzanie : Sixi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le sixi\u00e8me Cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-6) en Tanzanie sera le troisi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de cinq op\u00e9rations annuelles et d\u2019une op\u00e9ration en milieu de cycle qui financent la mise en \u0153uvre de la Strat\u00e9gie nationale pour la croissance et la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (plus connue sous le sigle de MKUKUTA). Son ancrage strat\u00e9gique porte sur deux ensembles cl\u00e9s d\u2019objectifs qui sont : assurer durablement une croissance \u00e9conomique forte et partag\u00e9e, et proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019extension d\u2019une fourniture efficiente des services de base par l\u2019entremise du budget de l\u2019\u00c9tat. Pour cette op\u00e9ration, il existe deux ensembles de risques, qui sont \u00e9troitement li\u00e9s entre eux et qui se chevauchent. Le premier ensemble englobe les risques g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui peuvent entraver la mise en \u0153uvre satisfaisante du MKUKUTA, notamment la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9conomie tanzanienne par rapport aux chocs externes, aux risques politiques li\u00e9s \u00e0 la situation \u00e0 Zanzibar, au fait d\u2019\u00eatre tributaire de l\u2019aide, \u00e0 la d\u00e9centralisation et aux contraintes de capacit\u00e9. Le second ensemble de risques pourrait miner la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 globale du processus d\u2019appui au budget g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u2013 et au PRSC \u2013 sous la forme d\u2019un moyen efficace de canaliser les ressources en vue de l\u2019atteinte des objectifs du MKUKUTA. L\u2019op\u00e9ration appuie les progr\u00e8s consid\u00e9rables qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplis par le gouvernement en mati\u00e8re d\u2019am\u00e9lioration du syst\u00e8me institutionnel et de financement des secteurs de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et des transports, et dans le domaine de la gouvernance, \u00e0 travers l\u2019adoption de nouveaux projets de lois portant sur la lutte contre la corruption et l\u2019audit.
