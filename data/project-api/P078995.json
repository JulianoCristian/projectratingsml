The revised PRSP has four strategic pillars: a) accelerating broad-based growth; b) promoting access to social services; c) increasing employment and income-generating activities for the poor; and, d) promoting good governance. As did the previous operations in the series, PRSC-5 supports the PRSP implementation under three components consistent with these four pillars: 1) growth and employment creation; 2) human resource development; and, 3) good governance. Under the growth and employment creation component, the PRSC-5 supports reforms in the cotton, rural sector, telecommunication sector, energy sector, and the labor market. The objective is to lower factor costs, increase productivity and favor new investments. The second component includes policies in the education, health, social protection, and water sectors to build infrastructure, lower the cost of services, and improve service quality. The third component encompasses policy measures to strengthen budget formulation, execution, procurement, and control, public sector performance, decentralization, and environmental management.

However, risks for the operation arise from the country's weak institutional capacity, still fragile fiduciary progress, natural disasters (drought, locust invasions), commodity prices and currency shocks, and regional instability. The different risks are mitigated under the credit through the approval of two Bank projects to address the institutional capacity issue; the integration in the reform program of key fiduciary reforms; the approval of a project to help prevent and fight "},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":16},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BF","sectorcode":"EZ,AZ,YB,JA,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"69,25,26,27,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,2,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":35},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20090428001014","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090428001014","DocDate":"30-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20080703031359","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080703031359","DocDate":"20-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010030111112989","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111112989","DocURL":"18-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010030111112989","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111112989","DocDate":"18-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050415110255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050415110255","DocDate":"07-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050421124849","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050421124849","DocDate":"21-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050207085317","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050207085317","DocDate":"23-JAN-2005"}],"countryname":"Burkina Faso","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
