This would be achieved through reduction of unit cost and transit time by: (a) upgrading Inland Waterways infrastructure to allow navigation of larger size vessels; (b) increasing shiplock capacity to reduce waiting time; and (c) increasing financial and organizational capacity of IWT agencies. The project components in Guangdong Province include: (a) renovation of Zhaoqing-Huatiaomen and Lianhuashan-Shawan-Ronggui (L-S-R) Waterways; (b) enhancement of maintenance dredging capacity and operational management; (c) technical assistance for institutional development and implementation support and training; (d) resettlement, monitoring and maintenance during implementation; and (e) tax and duties.
