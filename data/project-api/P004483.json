Policy changes are being introduced to reduce disparities in educational opportunity, to improve quality, and to increase the efficiency of the school system as follows: a revised procedure is being adopted to allocate a larger share of development expenditures to educationally deprived regions; the share of recurrent expenditure for nonsalary items is being increased to improve the quality of instruction; the policy for teacher utilization is being revised to make more efficient use of subject matter teachers; and policies for student admissions, evaluation, and progression are being improved to raise the participation rate of the school-aged group and to reduce the dropout rate. The organization, functions, and staffing of the main agencies involved with elementary education are being modified to strengthen sector management and planning. Instructional programs and materials and the distribution of facilities and teachers will also be improved."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925080600","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925080600","DocDate":"29-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902375935","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902375935","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912541557","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912541557","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
