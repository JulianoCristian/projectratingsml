The Pilot Crisis Response Window (CRW) will cover US$15 million out of the total credit amount. This is the fifth and the last credit in a series of five annual programmatic PRSC operations (PRSC-4/8) supporting the implementation of Tanzania's National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty 2005- 2010. As the last operation in the series, this PRSC-8 is a bridge between the current and the next series of PRSCs, which would start with the planned PRSC-9. Against the country context of the weaker-than-expected poverty reduction over the past seven years, as well as the negative impact of the global financial crisis, the specific objectives of this operation are to: (i) complete and consolidate reform achievements under the current PRSC series to move toward the stated medium-term objectives of the series; and (ii) strategically lay the ground for the next series based on medium-term goals. The trends in poverty reduction are described in section two of this report, and the implications in terms of program design for PRSC- 8, notably an increased focus on income generation and rural areas, are discussed in section five. The impact of the global financial crisis on Tanzania is discussed in 'recent economic developments' in section two, and the Bank's responses are discussed in \"operation description\" in section five. The progress on the government program supported by PRSC and on the broader policy spectrum are described in section five under 'summary assessment of overall progress' and 'description of policy areas.'"},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":15},"theme2":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":10},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"115,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"TP,YZ,LT,BZ,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"70,27,83,53","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"6,11,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":13},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000442464_20130719093433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130719093433","DocDate":"14-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011041722272389","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011041722272389","DocDate":"17-APR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010121516480718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010121516480718","DocDate":"08-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100908025907","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100908025907","DocDate":"30-AUG-2010"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
