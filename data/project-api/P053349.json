The components will: 1) support immediate improvements in marine, and coastal protected areas (MPAs), through planning, management, and monitoring efforts, specifically, through the establishment of a MPA data-baseline, and monitoring programs; the development of management plans for MPAs; supply of basic equipment, and infrastructure for MPA planning; and, a trans-boundary cooperation in policy, protection, and management of MPAs. Capacity building for MPA management will include regional training courses/workshops, namely the Marine Park and Tourism Resource Development Program, and Training Library Development; 2) establish a regional environmental monitoring, and information system (EIS), and, develop a web-based EIS, as tools to organize, and disseminate environmental data on reefs, and ecosystems in the MBRS. Targeted research will support field studies, to include water quality flows, and develop a hydrodynamic surface flow model; 3) promote sustainable fisheries management, through institutional strengthening, and monitoring, and, facilitate sustainable coastal/marine tourism, through policy dialogues, and a cooperative action forum; and, 4) develop public awareness campaigns, provide formal/informal education, supported by the coordination of a regional steering committee, a consultative group, and the program coordination unit."},"country_namecode":"Central
