The increased output of oilseeds which is to be achieved through intensification and diversification of cropping patterns will result in higher and more stable farm income.  These objectives will be achieved by expanding the area under oilseeds and raising the yields of oilseeds to international levels through the establishment of an appropriate policy framework and support infrastructure.  Specifically, the project will strengthen the provincial Departments of Agriculture through the provision of (a) extension staff, training, farm equipment and vehicles to plan, implement and monitor the oilseed development program; (b) equipment for seed processing and multiplication; (c) research personnel and equipment for applied research to adapt varieties; and (d) project coordination and monitoring units at the provincial levels.  The project will also provide funds to participating credit institutions (PCIs) for onlending to farmers for oilseed production."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of
