The project is expected to allow various benefits to the Guinean economy. In the short term, improved training of skilled workers would lead to increased productivity in the industrial sectors. Medium-term benefits would include: further development of the national education system, definition of qualitative and quantitative education targets, reallocation of resources available to the education sector to assure their optimum use, and revision of existing policies regarding employment guarantees for vocational training and university graduates."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20030728103453","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030728103453","DocDate":"26-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912594757","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912594757","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902412963","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902412963","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e058e1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e058e1_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e058df_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e058df_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100322060021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100322060021","DocDate":"03-MAR-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
