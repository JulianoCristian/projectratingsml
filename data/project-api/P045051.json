The project has two components. The first delivers cost-effective interventions against HIV/AIDS by 1) targeting interventions for groups at high risk, specifically commercial sex workers, injecting drug users, migrant workers, men having sex with men, and STI (sexually transmitted infection) clinic attendees; 2) providing locally appropriate information, communication, and awareness campaigns; voluntary testing and counseling; and a strengthened infrastructure for blood safety and hospital and occupational precaution programs; and 3) establishing new sources of support for AIDS care in partnership with nongovernmental organizations. The second component finances institutional strengthening by enhancing planning, management, and implementation capacity at the national, state, and local levels; strengthens the leadership capacity of the health and family welfare ministry; conducts training; builds capacity for ongoing monitoring and supervision; supports operational research and research and development; and supports broad social mobilization and cooperation and information."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"191,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Other Health Study,Other Health Study,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BH,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"69,57,59,88","mjthemecode":"8,7,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Other Health Study (HLT),  Vol.1","DocType":"HLT","EntityID":"000333037_20141017162235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20141017162235","DocDate":"19-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Other Health Study (HLT),  Vol.2","DocType":"HLT","EntityID":"000333037_20141017163004","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20141017163004","DocDate":"19-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20061010101924","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20061010101924","DocDate":"29-SEP-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123550635","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123550635","DocURL":"14-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123550635","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123550635","DocDate":"14-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99060905302420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99060905302420","DocDate":"13-MAY-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
