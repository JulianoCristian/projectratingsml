In order to strengthen policy formulation and management capacity, the project will : (i) facilitate development of improved health policies in the areas of cost recovery, manpower development and facility management; (ii) strengthen the Ministry of Health (MOH) through reorganisation of the central ministry, and development of an improved financial management information system; and (iii) contribute to improving food security policies by aiding in policy analyses on food pricing and distribution. The project will assist in improving services by : (i) renovating and equipping selected health facilities; (ii) establishing better hospital management procedures; (iii) constructing and renovating drug storage facilities; and (iv) improving health manpower training. Finally, the project will increase the efficiency of the urban food distribution system through management streamlining and strengthening of supplemental feeding programs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":74},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":26},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"27,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"themecode":"68,54,67","mjthemecode":"8,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":74},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":26}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980804143005","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980804143005","DocDate":"29-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120440597","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120440597","DocURL":"28-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120440597","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120440597","DocDate":"28-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120441798","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120441798","DocDate":"28-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120441798","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120441798","DocURL":"28-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e083e5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e083e5_1_0","DocDate":"14-MAR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927073449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927073449","DocDate":"23-FEB-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927073337","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927073337","DocDate":"01-FEB-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique"}},"facets":{}}
