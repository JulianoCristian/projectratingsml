The project consists of three components. 1) Institutionalization of Gender Approach in Poverty-alleviation Program will ensure improved gender equity in the access to opportunities and resources of social and economic development programs. The activities it finances will include awareness raising seminars and workshops to build the capacity of the Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL) employees; review of the norms, standards, processes, and procedures of SEDESOL; and implementation and monitoring of an information system with a gender focus. 2) The Community-based Gender Development component will promote community-based actions to improve equity in opportunities for men and women, peaceful sociability, and respect to the dignity of all social groups, regardless of sex and ethnicity. 3) The Gender Awareness component will promote awareness of the value of equitable relations between men and women by transmitting new ideas and successful experiences that can be replicated throughout urban and rural Mexico."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":64},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":24},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"3,070,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"FE,JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"76,59,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,7,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":64},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":24},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20060502091834","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060502091834","DocDate":"24-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00061005312682","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00061005312682","DocDate":"26-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00030205382175","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00030205382175","DocDate":"08-FEB-2000"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
