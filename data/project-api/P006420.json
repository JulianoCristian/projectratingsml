The project objectives are to: (a) increase agricultural production and productivity in the State of Ceara; (b) generate employment opportunities for low-income rural families; (c) increase Ceara's institutional capacity to provide efficient agricultural services for small farmers; and (d) promote water-resource development and technology generation and diffusion. This latter component aims to decrease small farmer vulnerability to recurring droughts. Consequently, the project supports water resource development for both agriculture and domestic use, fish hatcheries, agricultural research, agricultural extension, investment credit, marketing
