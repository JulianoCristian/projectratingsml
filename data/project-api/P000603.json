To ensure effective and timely implementation of the project, it will also support local capacity building in the planning, execution, monitoring and evaluation of sector management.  The project will improve learning at primary level through increased participation in quality education.  Participation will be improved through: (a) establishment of local school committees with financial and managerial authority on public primary schools; (b) provision of adequate infrastructure.  Quality of the teaching-learning processes will be improved through: (a) development of better management practices to monitor delivery of the study program; (b) provision of teaching/learning materials, both for class and individual learning activities; (c) changes in the teaching/learning methods used by teachers in the classroom; (d) changes in the supervision practices to develop and monitor implementation of effective teaching practices; and (e) support to development of learning assessment and education information systems at regional and central levels of the Ministry of Education (MOE).  The project will also improve competencies of skilled workers through the establishment of an autonomous, flexible and effective demand-driven training system in which training institutions and employers will get grants from the Government.  The establishment of a performing vocational training system will be achieved through the creation of a small, autonomous institution: the Office of Vocational Training (OVT).  Competencies and skills will be developed through: (a) support for management and the initial financing of a Vocational Training Fund (VTF); (b) support for the de"},"country_namecode":"Union of the Comoros!$!KM","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":14},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"7,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"KM","sectorcode":"BH,BC,EV,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"51,65,66,59,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,7,8,8,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":65},{"Name":"Education","Percent":14},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040624105348","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040624105348","DocDate":"10-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030515302677","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030515302677","DocDate":"24-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030515281978","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030515281978","DocDate":"24-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184654","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184654","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3971023103511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971023103511","DocDate":"05-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052711255184","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052711255184","DocDate":"12-SEP-1994"}],"countryname":"Union of the Comoros","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
