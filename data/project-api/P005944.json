It is intended to facilitate grain exports at the Bahia Blanca Port. This is however only for the short term until 1993. A proposed follow up project would address the long term export needs. The project comprises the following three parts. First, civil works and equipment will be used for the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and the replacement of a damaged grain elevator by a modern installation. Second, civil works and equipment will be used for a silo safety system at selected grain terminals. Finally, technical assistance will be provided to strengthen port management, administration and operational systems."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170624","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170624","DocDate":"22-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032411393538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032411393538","DocDate":"25-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042216010236","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042216010236","DocDate":"25-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042216030737","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042216030737","DocDate":"25-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171441","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171441","DocDate":"30-APR-1987"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
