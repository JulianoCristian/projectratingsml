Project components will: 1) develop a telecommunication policy, through consulting services to reflect the principles of liberalization, independent regulation, and privatization of the Public Telecommunication Company (TDM). Assistance will also be provided to the Ministry of Transport and Communications in building capacity in sector analysis, policy formulation, and monitoring criteria to liaise throughout the reform process. Additionally, a comprehensive telecommunications, and postal legal, and regulatory framework will be prepared, by strengthening the Telecommunications and Postal Regulatory Authority's capacity, and, technical assistance (TA) will support TDM's privatization. A strategy for market-based rural access should establish provision of seed money, and universal fund access, while a modernization strategy will elaborate a postal policy focused on competitiveness to improve services, in addition to enabling legislation for an information, and communications (IC) technology strategy; 2) develop an air transport policy, and regulatory framework, by strengthening the capacity of the Civil Aviation Policy Unit, through the provision of TA, training, and consulting services, to restructure, and foster private participation of the national airline, and to implement the concession of the Maputo International Airport; and, 3) support project management, procurement, and financial management, and, finance IC campaign and dissemination."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Aviation","Percent":36},"sector3":{"Name":"Postal services","Percent":24},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"14,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Aviation"},{"Name":"Postal services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"CD,TV,CT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"40,39","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Aviation","code":"TV"},{"name":"Postal services","code":"CD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":40},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":36},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":24}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100420020634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100420020634","DocDate":"30-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031215030517","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031215030517","DocDate":"17-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0111070411072","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0111070411072","DocDate":"30-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01080104004621","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01080104004621","DocDate":"23-JUL-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
