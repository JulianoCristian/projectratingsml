The project will: (a) improve children's and teachers' access to adequate quantities of learning materials; (b) improve teachers' competence in the classroom; (c) provide children in low-income urban areas with physical space adequate for learning; (d) provide school, municipal, and regional level administrators, with tools, skills and incentives to improve management practices and take new responsibilities; and (e) achieve greater equity between state and municipal school systems in terms of spending per student and the availability of essential educational inputs. In support for Parana's innovative efforts to administer the first four years of primary school in partnership with municipalities, project investments will be directed to the state education system and to those municipalities in partnership agreements with the state. Thus, the project consists of the following five components: (a) instructional materials; (b) teacher training; (c) school upgrading and expansion of access; (d) institutional development; and (e)
