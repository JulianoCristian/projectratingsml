This will be achieved through establishing government policies, regulations, procedures, and practices related to school books, and making textbooks available in classrooms in sufficient quantity and in a sustainable way. Specifically, the project will support: 1) provision of textbooks in all required subjects, for all children in primary (SD) and junior secondary (SLTP) schools, public and private, giving priority attention to poor children; 2) procurement of the SLTP textbooks from private publishers and Balai Pustaka, through a transparent and rigorous evaluation and approval process, with the objective of achieving a high quality in the books; 3) greater involvement at the provincial level, through implementing the procurement process for SLTP textbooks at the Kanwil level; 4) giving help to teachers in how to use the books better in the classroom; and 5) the promotion of reading, especially for children."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":47},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":47},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":2},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"132,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BC,BH,ET,EP,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"65,61","mjthemecode":"7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":47},{"Name":"Education","Percent":47},{"Name":"Education","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040708105040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040708105040","DocDate":"16-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123074496","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123074496","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123074496","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123074496","DocURL":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3c33_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3c33_1_0","DocDate":"23-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb99_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb99_1_0","DocDate":"23-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019102758","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019102758","DocDate":"01-MAY-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
