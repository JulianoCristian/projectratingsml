This GEF investment has four components and is a pilot activity to be implemented in three selected counties of Croatia: (i) Osije?ko-Baranjska; (ii) Vukovarsko-Srijemska; and (iii) Vara\u009edinska. The first project component consists of mitigating nutrient loads to water bodies from point-source pollution (manure management) which will assist the Government of Croatia to promote sustainable manure management practices with the objective of reducing nutrient loads to the surface and ground water bodies of Croatia. The second component consists of development and promotion of agro-environment measures which will assist with the implementation of the Code of Good Agricultural Practices (CGAP), currently under preparation. The third component consists of a public awareness and replication strategy which will disseminate the benefits of proposed project activities. Finally, the fourth component consists of project management which involves the establishment of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) whose aim is to mainstream project implementation
