The project restructuring aims at addressing some minor shortcomings in the original project design, which were identified in a July 2006 midterm review and in two supervision missions in October 2006 and April 2007. The corresponding adjustments are expected to remove minor roadblocks to project implementation. In particular, the restructuring includes, first, small changes in the set of activities to be financed within certain components. These changes are aimed at eliminating activities that are no longer viable or necessary and to add others that are deemed critical to generate the expected project outcomes and to facilitate the achievement of the project's development objectives. Second, the restructuring includes revisions in the expenditure categories to be financed within existing activities (e.g. adding the financing of minor works or equipment in activities where only consultancies had been included in the original budget). Changes are also proposed in the overall maximum amounts to be financed within each expenditure category.  Third, the restructuring also includes changes in relevant definitions and loan covenants."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
