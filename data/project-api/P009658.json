Most of the proceeds of the credit would be lent to farmers in Mysore for on-farm investments in minor irrigation, land reclamation and levelling and mechanization through the Agricultural Refinance Corporation, which would refinance the Mysore State Land Development Bank and its federated Primary Banks (PLDB) as well as selected commercial banks lending to farmers under the project. In addition, the project would include financing for well-drilling and earthmoving equipment and for consultancy services to assist in the proper exploitation of groundwater resources through detailed geologic and hydrologic studies. Under the project, wells and lift irrigation will be provided and land levelling carried out to irrigate 142,000 ha, of which 50,000 ha would also benefit by the use of the 2,000 tractors to be supplied. In all, some 36,000 farmers would be able to expand their output of food and commercial crops."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912492063","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912492063","DocDate":"07-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902180249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902180249","DocDate":"31-DEC-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081de303b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de303b_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de3039_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de3039_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228afe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228afe_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1971"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
