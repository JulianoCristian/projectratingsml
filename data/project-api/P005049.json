The project includes:  (i) provision of incremental farm inputs; (ii) provision of agricultural machinery and spare parts; (iii) establishment of machinery repair and service facilities; and (iv) a new seed cleaning plant and two seed laboratories.  It involves (v) training in extension, machine operation and agricultural credit; (vi) establishment of mechanized centers for the testing and demonstration of new machines; and (vii) technical assistance to research staff.  The technical assistance would help to develop appropriate  mechanization systems and the preparation of a study on the seed industry.  Selective mechanization of farming activities will be promoted by expanding the role of private machinery hire services and by enlarging the network of dealerships for agricultural machinery."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"139,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961219124022","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219124022","DocDate":"20-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094713","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094713","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101146","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101146","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
