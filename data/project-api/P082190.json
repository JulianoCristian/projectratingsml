Its principal benefit will be to provide a coordinated framework for the balance of payments, and budgetary support. This will reduce transaction costs, will focus attention on development priorities, and allow the Government to mobilize external financing that would not otherwise be available. The project will further facilitate: the consolidation of the institutional framework for good governance; improvements in service delivery, and performance of key sectors, including the judiciary, education, health, agriculture, and institutions supporting private sector development; increased attention to capacity building requirements in the public sector; and, strengthening of public expenditure management capacity, and improving the policy alignment of external financing, by channeling resources through the budget. While risks remain, namely, capacity constraints; failure to contain power sector subsidies; corruption; and, unemployment, the project high priority on capacity building, on management to improve cost-recovery, and, Government commitments, should outweigh those risks."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!$!TP","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":54},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":8},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"4,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TP","sectorcode":"JB,JA,EZ,AZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rule of law","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,27,25,32,30","mjthemecode":"2,3,2,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":54},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":17},{"Name":"Education","Percent":17},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":8},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070821115225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070821115225","DocDate":"19-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050218103848","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050218103848","DocDate":"14-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20030701125446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030701125446","DocDate":"19-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03050704072684","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03050704072684","DocDate":"19-JUN-2003"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste"}},"facets":{}}
