This policy has attracted considerable foreign investment and foreign enterprises still dominate a large part of the Ivorian economy; most enterprises, whatever their scale, are owned and run by foreigners, although in 1968 a program was established to foster Ivorian private enterprise. The Bank loan of US$5.6 million to Credit de la Cote d'lvoire (CCI) will help meet the financial requirements of investments by small-scale enterprises (SSEs) in the Ivory Coast through 1978. The loan is expected to improve the efficiency of, and the cooperation between, CCI and Office national de promotion de l'entreprise ivoirienne (OPEI), the country's principal public financing and technical assistance agencies in this field and more generally, to foster the Government's promotion program for indigenous SSEs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire!$!CI","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CI","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902245383","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902245383","DocDate":"31-AUG-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e72601_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e72601_1_0","DocDate":"21-AUG-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e72600_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e72600_1_0","DocDate":"21-AUG-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333037_20100210022126","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100210022126","DocDate":"21-JUL-1975"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire"}},"facets":{}}
