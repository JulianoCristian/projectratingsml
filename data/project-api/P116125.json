In the months since the first loan in the program was disbursed, the external economic environment has changed dramatically, causing growth in Poland to slow sharply. To better manage the uncertainty that the world economic crisis has introduced to Poland's outlook and fiscal targets, while pushing ahead with reform of public financial management and improvements in the business environment, the Government is now focusing on the part of the program specifically targeting the labor market, education, health and social protection. The PL2 continues to support reforms initiated with the first loan and expands the focus to include structural improvements in, and the maintenance of, critical programs in the social sectors."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":32},"totalcommamt":"1,300,240,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"JB,EC,BE,JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Economic management","Financial and private sector development","Human development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"67,65,43,21,54","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,1,4,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Education","Percent":11},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20130912095644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130912095644","DocDate":"25-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2009111014232891","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009111014232891","DocDate":"02-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2009111014232891","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009111014232891","DocURL":"02-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20090610015216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090610015216","DocDate":"03-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090521103924","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090521103924","DocDate":"18-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000013944_20090428142528","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000013944_20090428142528","DocDate":"27-APR-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
