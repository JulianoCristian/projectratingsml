The objective will be achieved through a) the sustainable and efficient provision of water supply services in the project area; b) supporting urgent repairs to infrastructure; c) the demonstration of the viability of private sector participation in the provision of water supply services; and d) the development of a model for integrated water resources management in the project area. There are two project components: 1) The urban water supply improvement component will improve the quality and efficiency of water supply provision through three sub-components - the urgent infrastructure repairs sub-component, the management improvement sub-component, and the infrastructure rehabilitation fund sub-component. These sub-components will support works and goods to resolve urgent system repairs needed as a result of damage from the conflict and lack of maintenance and for infrastructure improvements. 2) The integrated water resources management component will finance activities to develop a framework for integrated water resources management for the project area, focused primarily on the issue of allocation of water between water supply and irrigation users."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kosovo!$!XK","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"4,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"XK","sectorcode":"BC,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"85,58,78,44,71","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"9,4,10,7,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":94},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050802113419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050802113419","DocDate":"15-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051316375403","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051316375403","DocDate":"18-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00062305373129","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00062305373129","DocDate":"24-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01021405523593","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01021405523593","DocDate":"30-SEP-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kosovo","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
