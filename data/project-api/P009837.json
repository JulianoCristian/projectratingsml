It also aims to improve the average quality of coking coal supplies and thus contribute to greater efficiency in the use of indigenous energy resources.  The project consists of the development of one open-pit mine at Jharia and one underground mine at Pootkie-Bulliary, two coal washeries, and other associated facilities in the Jharia coalfield in the State of Bihar.  The project further seeks to support institutional development in the areas of underground mine design and operating practices, shaft sinking and sand transportation, as well as project management. Furthermore, it addresses the sectoral issue of coal quality and facilitates continuation of a dialogue on coal transportation and distribution, producer-consumer linkages, and investment planning."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"248,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"NN","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining","code":"NX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","code":"NN"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019173858","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019173858","DocDate":"29-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151820","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101128","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101128","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
