Divided into five parts, it is intended to introduce institutional improvements, cost recovery and long term policy reforms that will strengthen the overall development of the sector. First, it will promote the creation and development of appropriate institutional, financial, and technical structures to manage sewerage services in major urban centers. Second, an extensive rehabilitation program to prevent further deterioration of the existing sewer systems p in the Greater Casablanca area will be initiated. Third, additional facilities will be built in order to cope with the increasing domestic and industrial demand for sewerage and storm drainage. Fourth, least cost alternatives for sewerage treatment and disposal will be identified. Finally, effective operation and maintenance of sewerage facilities and standardization in the quality of design and implementation of sewerage extension works will be provided."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"BC,WS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Urban development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,73,25","mjthemecode":"2,9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042609073371","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042609073371","DocDate":"11-APR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032311222072","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032311222072","DocDate":"27-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042210585173","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042210585173","DocDate":"27-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926041700","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926041700","DocDate":"06-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
