The Government of Mauritius continues to diversify the economy to enable the country to achieve a higher income status in the medium term. Since independence in 1968, economic growth in Mauritius has been built on a long tradition of economic and institutional reforms. This DPL series supports the strengthening of the institutional, policy, and management tools required to address some of the challenges posed by these reforms. The fiscal position is improving, and the government achieved greater debt consolidation in 2012 than had originally been expected."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mauritius!$!MU","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>MU \u2013 Deuxi\u00e8me Pr\u00eat \u00e0 l\u2019appui des politiques de d\u00e9veloppement de la performance du secteur public</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>L\u2019objectif de d\u00e9veloppement du deuxi\u00e8me programme de pr\u00eat en appui \u00e0 la politique de d\u00e9veloppement de la performance du secteur public de Maurice est de soutenir les am\u00e9liorations de la performance du secteur public \u00e0 Maurice en aidant le gouvernement \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre des r\u00e9formes fond\u00e9es sur les trois piliers suivants\u00a0: 1) renforcement des programmes qui soutiennent et autonomisent les personnes les plus vuln\u00e9rables\u00a0; 2) rationalisation des r\u00e9glementations et des processus commerciaux\u00a0; et 3) am\u00e9lioration de la gestion des ressources humaines dans le service civil et le suivi de la performance des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019\u00c9tat.
