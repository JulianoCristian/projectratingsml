The primary highway and the complementary feeder roads to be constructed under the project will support future rural development efforts and will accelerate the rate of expansion of the agricultural frontier along the Parana river. Readily quantifiable benefits will be a substantial reduction in transport costs, and an increase in agricultural production in the area. The project will contribute to institution-building within the Ministry of Public Works and Communications: the feeder roads component will provide overall support to agricultural programs, while the OCIPT component will help improve transport planning within the Ministry; DGV's staffing capabilities will be improved to enhance the Ministry's effectiveness."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Paraguay!$!PY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"39,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"PY","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924215755","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924215755","DocDate":"30-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924215711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924215711","DocDate":"07-AUG-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902331867","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902331867","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e940_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e940_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Paraguay"}},"facets":{}}
