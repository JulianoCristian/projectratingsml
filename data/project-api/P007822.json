It represents an important step in continuing the reduction of dependence on thermal power generation. Specifically, the project consists of:  (a) raising the height of the existing dam of the Fortuna Project by 40 meters to increase its generating capacity by 247 GWh p.a. using the existing generation equipment. The project would furthermore include; (b) completing feasibility studies for two medium-size hydroelectric projects for future construction to meet growth of demand; and (c) an asset revaluation study.  The proposed project would meet the growing projected demand for electric power through 1991 in support of Panama's economic and social development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Panama!$!PA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"51,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PA","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904162154","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904162154","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151215","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151215","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Panama"}},"facets":{}}
