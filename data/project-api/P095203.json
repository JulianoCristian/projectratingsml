This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional loan in an amount of US$150 million to Joint Stock Company The Export-Import bank of Ukraine (Ukreximbank or UEB) with the guarantee of Ukraine as Additional Finance (AF) to EDP2. The additional loan would help finance scaled-up activities of EDP2 to enhance the impact of a well-performing credit line to Ukrainian exporters. The resumption of growth of the Ukrainian economy is particularly dependant on the pick-up in exports in the post-crisis environment. UEB has been particularly effective in extending sub-loans directly to exporters throughout the crisis period (2009-2010), after participation of the intermediating local banks was temporarily suspended due to the worsening of their financial condition and violation of eligibility criteria in late 2008-early 2009. Going forward, EDP2 AF credit line would be extended both by UEB directly, and through resuming or new participating banks, thus enhancing the reach of the project. No changes to the current project design are there. Expected outcomes from the activities to be supported with additional financing would relate to increased exports of the Ukrainian corporate sector in the short term, its enhanced capacity to sustain and grow exports in the medium- to long-term, and improvements in its average cost (reduction) and maturity (extension) of funding. AF for EDP2 is as the fastest and lowe"},"country_namecode":"Ukraine!$!UA","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"International financial standards and
