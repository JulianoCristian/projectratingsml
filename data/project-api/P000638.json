In accordance with this priority, the objectives of the proposed project are:  (a) alleviating the constraints currently impeding the increased production of cocoa; and (b) establishing the necessary infrastructure to maintain the momentum of development in the cocoa sub-sector in the future.  To achieve these objectives, project actions would:  (a) provide agricultural credit to meet the seasonal, medium-term, and long-term financing needs of creditworthy farmers and cooperatives.  This would include strengthening the capacity and operational efficiency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Rural Development (MOA) and the project implementing agencies.  The project would accomplish this through the international recruitment of five specialists, on-the-job and overseas training of local staff, improvement of buildings and operating facilities, and provision of vehicles and office equipment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Equatorial Guinea!$!GQ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GQ","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925203358","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925203358","DocDate":"22-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000334955_20090122052839","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090122052839","DocDate":"15-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05cf2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05cf2_1_0","DocDate":"19-FEB-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151721","DocDate":"31-JAN-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Equatorial Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
