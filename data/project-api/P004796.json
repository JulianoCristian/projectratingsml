The project has two major components. The first one, distribution system improvement and expansion, comprises: (a) construction of subtransmission and distribution facilities; and (b) consulting studies regarding: (i) formulation of strategies for privatization of some of MEA's activities, (ii) design and implementation of subsystems in the integrated financial and management information system; and (iii) environmental and safety considerations in system design. The second component, promotion of electricity energy efficiency, includes the Five Year Demand Side Management Master Plan."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"109,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,39,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0008040538153","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0008040538153","DocDate":"13-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122580217","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122580217","DocURL":"30-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122580318","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122580318","DocURL":"30-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122580217","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122580217","DocDate":"30-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003003931","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003003931","DocDate":"02-APR-1993"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
