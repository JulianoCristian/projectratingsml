The project has three components. The first finances research preservation (museums, manuscripts), rehabilitates buildings and sites, and affords training in preservation architecture and archives. The project supports the conservation and valorization of cultural heritage assets through restoration and preservation of archaeological and historic sites, ancient manuscripts and libraries. The second component promotes cultural heritage developing the craft and tourism industries. It contributes to the revitalization of economic activity in these areas by creating small scale enterprises and by capitalizing on tourism potential. Moreover, popular events such as music festivals, presentations of oral traditions, poetry contests, and traditional dance exhibitions may be held and, together with the production and sale of artisanal objects, could provide important and sustainable links between cultural preservation and income generation. The third component, the cultural heritage management component, establishes an appropriate institutional and financial framework to elaborate the cultural heritage strategy and operationalize it."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania!$!MR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Analysis of economic growth","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MR","sectorcode":"JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Economic management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"20,86,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,11,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Analysis of economic growth","code":"20"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":70},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20051102144908","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051102144908","DocDate":"26-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201151080","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201151080","DocURL":"13-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201151080","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201151080","DocDate":"13-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00062405385268","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00062405385268","DocDate":"20-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00101905453062","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00101905453062","DocDate":"31-DEC-1998"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Mauritania","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
