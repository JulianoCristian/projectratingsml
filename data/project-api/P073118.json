In accordance with the main goal of the MAP, the development objectives of the project are to contribute to curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Benin and to mitigating its impact for all those who are infected or affected through 1) accelerating, intensifying, diversifying, and empowering the response to civil society and the public sector to the HIV/AIDS epidemic; and 2) building capacity in both civil society and the public sector to achieve and sustain this scaled-up response. The project has three components: The first supports the response of civil society by strengthening the institutional capacities of community-based organizations and civil society organizations, carrying out awareness campaigns, training, and community sub-project preparation. It also provides commuunity grants for executing sub-projects, and financial support to civil service organizations for executing prevention and care activities for communities. The second component finances the response of the public sector by supporting non-health sector action plans, or health sector intervention/activities. The third component supports project coordination, management and monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":59},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":24},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"23,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"BC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,59,88,67","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":59},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":24},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080817235848","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080817235848","DocDate":"15-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20060306113212","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060306113212","DocDate":"01-FEB-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201270274","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201270274","DocURL":"17-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201270274","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201270274","DocDate":"17-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01121804110258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01121804110258","DocDate":"10-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0102140554061","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0102140554061","DocDate":"22-AUG-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin"}},"facets":{}}
