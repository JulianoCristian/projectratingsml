This additional grant would help finance the costs associated with completing original civil works activities that face cost overruns, and implementing additional activities related to the control and prevention of onchocerciasis and avian influenza. This restructuring also supports modification of key performance indicators to strengthen the project focus on critical health outcomes, and scaling back of the malaria program in response to increased funding for these activities now available from other development partners. No changes to the project development objective, general design, and implementation modalities are sought. The proposed additional financing and the related project restructuring are designed to scale up the project's impact and development effectiveness, and help Sierra Leone speed up progress in restoring essential functions of the health delivery system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Sierra Leone!$!SL","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
