The project components will: 1) increase highway capacity, and regional integration, through capital investments in the construction of the Xiaogan - Xiangfan Expressway (XXE). It will link major industrial, and hub cities, and reach less developed counties in the western, and mountainous part of Hubei, stimulating socioeconomic development; 2) include a rural road improvement program, to facilitate accessibility in low-income areas. This component comprises various subprojects for the rehabilitation, and upgrade of existing road sections. The road selection criteria include county income levels, expected impacts on the population served, consistency with provincial priorities, and, economic rate of return; and, 3) strengthen the capacity, and sustainability of highway management in the Province, by building sector institutions, and facilitating institutional transition to the needs of a market economy.
