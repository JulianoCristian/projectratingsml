This will be achieved through commitments to finance line items in the Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA's) annual investment budgets for 1994-97, contingent on progress in implementing a Development Action Plan of key actions and policy reforms necessary for effective use of the selected investments.  Sub-sectors include:  (a) irrigation and water-use efficiency - efficient operation of new and existing infrastructure is critical as Tunisia moves towards full mobilization of available water resources.  The Agriculture Sector Investment Loan (ASIL) will finance small scale dams, irrigation perimeters associated with either such dams or tubewells, modernization of existing perimeters, groundwater surveying and monitoring, and rural potable water.  Needed policy actions are additional increases in water charges, application of a binomial tariff, and promotion of water user associations; (ii) natural resource management - the ASIL will support soil erosion control, port infrastructure to encourage fishing along the high potential northern coast and to permit meeting the European Economic Community import quality standards, and agro-pastoral improvement of rangeland. Policy elements include implementation of the revised Soil Code, replacement of force account implementation of soil conservation works by contracts with farmers and private enterprises, and a review of existing subsidies intended to encourage fishing in the north; (iii) animal health and production - the ASIL will support the animal disease surveillance network through obligatory national vaccination campaigns and development of disease laboratories, and promote quality standards by financing equipment for programs aimed a"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":38},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":19},"sector4":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"BC,AB,AJ,WC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,75,85,82,79","mjthemecode":"10,11,11,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":38},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":35},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":19},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000094946_03071904005544","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03071904005544","DocDate":"26-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01072804083984","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072804083984","DocDate":"28-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123001302","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123001302","DocDate":"22-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123001503","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123001503","DocURL":"22-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123001302","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123001302","DocURL":"22-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123001503","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123001503","DocDate":"22-DEC-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
