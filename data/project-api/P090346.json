The main benefits will be reversing the slide in education indicators, bringing more children into school up to grade 8 (particularly poor children and girls) sooner than previously expected, providing better quality education. The program would contribute to closing the social gap and helping the Country progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to poverty reduction and Education for All (EFA). Another indirect, but important, benefit is that the program is strengthening decentralization by increasing the role of districts, and promoting accountability between service users (parents and students) and service providers (schools and teachers). Overall, given the success of the first year program, the risk rating is moderate for the second year program, proposed to be supported under this project. Nevertheless, there is a need to maintain continued vigilance in case of a change of priorities and focus at the political level, both at the province and districts."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":40},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"BH,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"65,26,57,27","mjthemecode":"2,7,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":60},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080307013641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080307013641","DocDate":"31-JUL-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2005102814513257","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005102814513257","DocURL":"16-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000021321_2010042315392193","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010042315392193","DocDate":"16-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000021321_2005102814513257","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005102814513257","DocDate":"16-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050310105745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050310105745","DocDate":"07-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20050307155405","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050307155405","DocDate":"20-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050103112030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050103112030","DocDate":"20-JUL-2004"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
