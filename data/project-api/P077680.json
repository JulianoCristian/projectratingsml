The development objectives of these five Bank operations are: 1) to help safeguard and maintain the productive capacity of the countries' tourism sectors, notably by securing the industry's emergency needs in the aftermath of the September 11 events; 2) to enhance security at key airport and seaport facilities in line with international standards, with the aim of preventing further acts of terrorism and safeguarding the sub-region's image as a safe tourist destination; and 3) to strengthen the countries' institutional capacity to develop and implement security plans, procedures, and measures as mandated by the international civil aviation and marine transport regulatory agencies. There are two main project components. The first finances one critical import, low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation, which is critical to the maintenance of economic activity in the tourism industry by ensuring that the energy-intensive tourism facilities are kept operational during the recovery period. The second component finances the physical and technical resources needed for national port and aviation authorities, as well as individual airports and seaports, to upgrade security arrangements at key facilities and meet international regulations."},"country_namecode":"Commonwealth of Dominica!$!DM","sector1":{"Name":"Aviation","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Power","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"3,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Aviation"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Information Document,Technical Annex","countrycode":"DM","sectorcode":"BC,TP,LD,TV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,44","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Aviation","code":"TV"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":50},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":32},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20051122084850","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20051122084850","DocDate":"08-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062516200080","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062516200080","DocDate":"19-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042014164682","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042014164682","DocDate":"19-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02032104564964","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02032104564964","DocDate":"13-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_02031504310253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02031504310253","DocDate":"19-FEB-2002"}],"countryname":"Commonwealth of Dominica"}},"facets":{}}
