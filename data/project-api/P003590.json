The project will also stabilize or even reverse upland environmental destruction through land and pasture improvement and soil conservation works, and encourage greater local community participation by enabling households to make key decisions during project design and implementation.  The project will comprise the following six components: 1) labor mobility; 2) rural infrastructure; 3) land and farmer development; 4) township and village enterprise (TVE) development; 5) microfinance; and 6) institution building and poverty monitoring."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
