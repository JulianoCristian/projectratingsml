The top priorities are to administer minimum income support measures efficiently and equitably, and to begin to support the unemployed; in their job search and training efforts. This project will assist the government to create the policy and institutional conditions for the development of an active and responsive labor market. The components of the project are: institutional development, both national and local, designed to develop labor policies; and the training, enterprises, and employment fund designed to develop a mechanism for channeling resources to projects to encourage flexible, demand driven training or promote the creation of small enterprises in the private sector for job creation. The project will lay the groundwork for the development of active labor markets in Albania; minimize the social cost of the transition; initiate delivery of services to help the unemployed; and provide a framework for providing public resources and external aid to private sector and community based organizations offering services to the unemployed;."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":63},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":37},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"5,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AL","sectorcode":"FE,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"51,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":63},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":37}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0001130530291","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0001130530291","DocDate":"15-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123322111","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123322111","DocURL":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123322212","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123322212","DocDate":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123322111","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123322111","DocDate":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123322212","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123322212","DocURL":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b2e7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b2e7_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b2e5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b2e5_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004152745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004152745","DocDate":"18-AUG-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Albania","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
