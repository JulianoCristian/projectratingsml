To this end, it would capitalize on results achieved during the pilot operation by: (a) completing the rehabilitation process; (b) providing technical assistance and training to the CREP/COOPEC membership in accounting and basic financial management; and (c) funding awareness campaigns designed to fully internalize the main principles of the mutualistic movement and ensure a strong sense of ownership from the members. In order to ensure long-term sustainability and financial independence of the movement, project efforts will focus on rural savings mobilization. To meet the above objectives, the project will include the following components: (a) rehabilitation and development of local CREPs; (b) support to regional service units (RSUs); and (c) support to the central management unit (CMU)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire!$!CI","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"2,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CI","sectorcode":"FE,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"41,42,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":95},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0204100401195","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0204100401195","DocDate":"14-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121203940","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121203940","DocDate":"01-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121203940","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121203940","DocURL":"01-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b60b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b60b_1_0","DocDate":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006025558","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006025558","DocDate":"02-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006025256","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006025256","DocDate":"02-MAR-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire"}},"facets":{}}
