The project consists of two components: agricultural research and extension service. The first component will: 1) strengthen the agricultural research institutions by improving the management information system, priority setting of research programs, and monitoring implementation and evaluating impact; 2) support human resource development by training research scientists, and introduce a results-oriented and performance-based reward system; 3) expand on-farm adaptive research responsive to farmers needs; and 4) provide facilities, infrastructure, and working capital for research institutions. The second component will: 1) strengthen the extension service by decentralizing to the grass roots level and strengthening farmer self-help groups; 2) develop human capital by training extension staff, and implement a reward system based on results and performance; and 3) provide facilities, infrastructure, and working capital for individual participants."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"24,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"NP","sectorcode":"AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,59,78,75","mjthemecode":"10,10,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03050704063881","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03050704063881","DocDate":"24-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123451442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123451442","DocDate":"18-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123451442","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123451442","DocURL":"18-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183704","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3971104184357","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971104184357","DocDate":"25-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060112235234","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060112235234","DocDate":"09-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"Nepal"}},"facets":{}}
