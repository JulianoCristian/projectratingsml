The reallocation is necessary to accommodate grant savings. The reallocation is justified given that the institutions subordinated by the Ministry of labor, social protection and family and the Ministry of health are affected by the current food price increases, and lack budget resources to accommodate these increases. This reallocation does not result in a change to the project activities, which are expected to reach full completion by the closing date of August 31, 2011. It does not also involve any changes to the project development objective or associated outcome targets."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
