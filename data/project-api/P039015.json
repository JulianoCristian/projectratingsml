There are five components in this project. First, institution building and policy development will develop a regulatory and monitoring framework and capacity, and undertake studies for development of water sector policy. Second, preparation for private sector management of urban water supply will support the bidding process for the private sector management of the water supply systems of the five cities, design and construct emergency works, prepare plans for the provision of sanitation services in the five cities. Third, rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) will reorient and reform the management and implementation of RWSS. Fourth, water resources management will develop a national water resources management strategy. Fifth, human resources development will emphasize management training and development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"36,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"BH,WA,BC,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"78,71,85,40","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,11,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":60},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":23},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":14},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060515103707","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060515103707","DocDate":"24-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980219162627","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980219162627","DocDate":"20-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183236","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183236","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980219162659","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980219162659","DocDate":"31-JUL-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
