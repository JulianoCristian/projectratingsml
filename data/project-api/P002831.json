(b) related infrastructure comprising: a railway line of about 80 km to connect the plant with the port of Lome, and railroad equipment; a rail/port terminal within the port of Lome; a power link and sub-station connecting the plant to the existing network; and a township. The project will provide for: (i) management and technical assistance to help CIMAO to achieve full capacity utilization rapidly; (ii) addition quarry equipment to prevent quarry operations from becoming a bottleneck (iii) spare parts and equipment to permit full plant operations and the carrying out of an adequate maintenance program; (iv) financing of fuel and (v) restoration of working capital to a healthy level. The project restores CIMAO's financial viability through provision of equity from shareholder Governments and long-term financing. Governments have agreed to set CIMAO's clinker prices according to an agreed price schedule until 1983 and will review prices periodically thereafter to maintain financial viability in the future. The restructuring measures are designed to help the company to reduce gradually clinker prices thereafter."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Togo!$!TG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Working Paper,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Working Paper","countrycode":"TG","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925004143","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925004143","DocDate":"23-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Working Paper (WP),  Vol.1","DocType":"WP","EntityID":"000456286_20131125164559","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20131125164559","DocDate":"01-NOV-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902260828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902260828","DocDate":"30-JUN-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b878_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b878_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b876_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b876_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b874_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b874_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b872_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b872_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b86c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b86c_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b86b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b86b_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b86a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b86a_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b869_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b869_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Working Paper (WP),  Vol.1","DocType":"WP","EntityID":"000456286_20131125162358","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20131125162358","DocDate":"18-MAY-1973"}],"countryname":"Republic of Togo"}},"facets":{}}
