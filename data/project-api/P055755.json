It is one element in a larger package of external financial assistance to help the government implement a comprehensive policy package comprising three parts: a strong macroeconomic framework, a strategy to reform the financial sector with special emphasis on the banking system; and a broad range of structural measures to sharpen competitiveness and improve guidance. Staffs of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Asian Development Bank are jointly assisting the government in implementing the program by emphasizing different components. The WB project components consist of 1) technical assistance by foreign experts for portfolio, financial, and system audits, particularly the evaluation of rehabilitation plans for private banks; 2) the restructuring of state banks with the resolution of bad debts of merged banks; 3) strengthening the examination, supervision, and regulatory functions of Bank Indonesia; and 4) a diagnostic review of the legal and institutional infrastructure for financial sector development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BG,BC,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,33","mjthemecode":"3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":94},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000090341_20031118111942","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20031118111942","DocDate":"04-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02012504050744","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02012504050744","DocDate":"28-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201383270","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201383270","DocURL":"15-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201383270","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201383270","DocDate":"15-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980203115321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980203115321","DocDate":"20-NOV-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
