It will supplement and complement ongoing investment in these two regions, using the recently constituted villages as the basic unit of investment. Specifically, the project would include agricultural investments in proven agriculture technical packages, research, village verification trials, extension, livestock and forestry; financing for land-use planning; a village self-help program; road improvement investments; a water supply component; and funds for project coordination and monitoring/evaluation. The most significant risk facing the project is whether the projected implementation schedule can be maintained. Efforts have been taken to provide the support needed to execute the project according to schedule and modest assumptions have been made with regard to implementation capacity."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b08222911f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08222911f_1_0","DocDate":"05-APR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902304877","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902304877","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912374969","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912374969","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228bca_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228bca_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228bc9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228bc9_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
