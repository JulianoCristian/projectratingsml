In order to generate incremental CC export earnings, the project will aim to rehabilitate, modernize and expand existing agro-processing industries. Investments in the needed equipment will be such as to allow Polish products to be upgraded to levels of quality required in western markets and will result in higher prices because of improved quality and packaging, and increased volume of exports. This will be particularly the case for ham in cans and in vacuum packing, frozen fruits and vegatables and forest products including game meat and berries, which are exported mainly to EEC countries. The project will also include support for export marketing activities of agro-processors and will meet part of the shortage in livestock feed and thus help maintain adequate supplies of livestock to processors."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":73},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":1},"sector3":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":26},"theme1":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":11},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":23},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Animal production"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"AJ,YA,YB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Rural development","Rural development","Trade and integration","Rural development"],"themecode":"75,45,78,76,23","mjthemecode":"1,10,10,5,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":73},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":1},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":26}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961219133719","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219133719","DocDate":"08-AUG-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042914035136","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042914035136","DocDate":"27-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041916024937","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041916024937","DocDate":"22-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041410123038","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041410123038","DocDate":"22-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927044524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927044524","DocDate":"05-JAN-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland"}},"facets":{}}
