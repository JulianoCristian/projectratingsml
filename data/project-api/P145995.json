These reforms are a part of Jamaica\u0092s National Development Plan which sets development goals for economic prosperity, human development, security, and management of natural resources. This development policy loan has two components. 1) improving investment climate and competitiveness; and 2) improving public financial management for sustained fiscal consolidation. The loan is aimed at removing key barriers to making the policy and institutional framework in Jamaica more conducive to supporting future growth, thereby stabilizing and improving the country\u0092s economy, which suffered from stagnation due to several negative factors such as low growth, high public debt and social challenges."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","sector1":{"Name":"Central
