There are four project components which comprise (a) strengthening the results-based management capacity at the State level for planning, cross-sectoral integration, monitoring and evaluation of public policies and investments under Maranhao's Multi-Year Government Investment Plan (PPA); (b) supporting cross-sectoral integration of development actions at the municipal and local levels through the design and implementation of integrated municipal development plans and the introduction of State-municipal performance agreements; (c) financing demand-driven community investments for income-generation, health and sanitation, education, culture, environmental management and others impacting the HDI and environmental sustainability; and (d) strengthening municipal governance through the participation of community associations and municipal councils in decisions that are directly related to improvements in the living conditions of the rural poor, and through capacity-building focused on integration of environmental sustainability issues in the decision-making process."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of
