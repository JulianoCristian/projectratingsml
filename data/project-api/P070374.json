The project has three components: The first has two sub-components that implement the \"Programa Equidad,\" a demand-driven grant program for developing small sub-projects which promote and strengthen the capacity of families to actively function within their community; and support the strengthening of existing networks or associations of community-based organizations and other civil society organizations through capacity building and technical assistance, and in some instances the provision of basic equipment such as computers or printers. Priority will be given to those networks that demonstrate innovative approaches to family strengthening, facilitate the participation of the family, and promote more equitable gender relations. The second component promotes awareness-raising and communication strategies at a micro-level that seeks to directly impact the project target areas to further enhance government-civil-society-community-family relationships, respect for non-traditional gender roles among youth and children, etc. The third component provides technical assistance and capacity building for the project implementation unit (PIU) staff and consultants."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":89},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"BH,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,62,57,55,69","mjthemecode":"8,6,7,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":89},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080811003249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080811003249","DocDate":"02-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201493137","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201493137","DocURL":"03-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201492936","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201492936","DocDate":"03-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201492936","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201492936","DocURL":"03-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201493137","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201493137","DocDate":"03-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01112804065880","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01112804065880","DocDate":"30-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00102505343319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00102505343319","DocDate":"31-JUL-2000"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
