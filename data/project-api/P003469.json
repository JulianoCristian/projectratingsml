To this end, the project comprises three components. They entail: (a) establishing a phosphate fertilizer production capacity at an existing plant in Yunnan; and (b) converting nitrogenous fertilizer production of four existing medium-size plants from low grade to high grade products, and expanding production capacities with the use of modern energy saving technology. Lastly, they include (c) carrying out a management efficiency study and a program to introduce modern systems for organization, information and cost management at fertilizer enterprises, and upgrade sector-wide management training capabilities."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u5316\u80a5\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u9020\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u65e8\u5728\u534f\u52a9\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u5236\u5b9a\u7684\u5316\u80a5\u884c\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u4e09\u5927\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u4e2d\u578b\u5316\u80a5\u5382\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u6548\u7387\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u517b\u5206\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u6784\u529e\u4e8b\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u5bb9\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u4e91\u5357\u7701\u4e00\u5bb6\u5316\u80a5\u5382\u7684\u78f7\u80a5\u751f\u4ea7\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u4f7f\u56db\u5bb6\u4e2d\u578b\u5316\u80a5\u5382\u4ece\u751f\u4ea7\u4f4e\u54c1\u7ea7\u6c2e\u80a5\u8f6c\u800c\u751f\u4ea7\u9ad8\u54c1\u7ea7\u6c2e\u80a5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u8282\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u6269\u5927\u4ea7\u80fd\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5f00\u5c55\u4e00\u9879\u7ba1\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e00\u9879\u7ba1\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4e3a\u5316\u80a5\u4f01\u4e1a\u5f15\u8fdb\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6210\u672c\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u884c\u4e1a\u7ba1\u7406\u57f9\u8bad\u80fd\u529b\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"97,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"IC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","code":"IC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022115543","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022115543","DocDate":"30-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032609410027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032609410027","DocDate":"28-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042709543128","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042709543128","DocDate":"28-DEC-1987"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
