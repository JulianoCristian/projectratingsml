The project has the following four components: Component 1) will finance demand-driven investment sub-projects aimed at improving the efficiency of water distribution to rehabilitate and modernize irrigation infrastructure as well as to improve conservation and maintenance machinery and equipment within the framework of IIIPs. Component 2) will support demand-driven investments subprojects prepared by water users in irrigation districts (DR) and irrigation units (UR), within the framework of IIIPs, and presented to their respective local project authorities for financing. Under this component, the project, through CNA will provide technical and financial assistance to beneficiaries to improve on-farm irrigation systems and water use efficiency, but at the same time, through an agreement with SAGARPA, project beneficiaries would receive financial support and technical assistance from the ongoing government program Alianza Contigo to increase agricultural productivity, diversify production and improve their marketing capabilities. Component 3) the objective is to strengthen water users' associations and improve their technical, managerial and financial capabilities to administer and operate their respective irrigation systems as well as participate in the decision making process regarding Integrated Irrigation Modernizatio"},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de Modernizaci\u00f3n Integral del Riego</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":87},"sector2":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":7},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"303,030,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"JB,BC,AH,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,26,85,45,79","mjthemecode":"10,5,11,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":87},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100519002637","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100519002637","DocDate":"26-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20060620110028","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060620110028","DocDate":"01-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03091104031344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03091104031344","DocDate":"12-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20031118095759","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20031118095759","DocDate":"07-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03052104045635","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052104045635","DocDate":"15-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0309160405262","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0309160405262","DocDate":"01-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03101004080328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03101004080328","DocDate":"01-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060116342097","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060116342097","DocDate":"26-SEP-2000"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
