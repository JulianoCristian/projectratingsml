The project will build upon the experience gained during the first GEF Grant to PROFONANPE, supporting the Trus Fund's establishment and development of its capacity to attract financial resources for conservation. The project has three major components: 1) participatory protected area management by involving civil society, private sector and local community organizations in the decision making process and management of the PAs; 2) institutional development to consolidate PA management through the strengthening of INRENA, PROFONANPE, PAMCs, civil society organizations and private sector to manage the PAs collaboratively; 3) PA financing, administration, monitoring and evaluation, and information dissemination in order to increase the PROFONANPE endowment fund, design and implement a SINANPE financing strategy."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Gesti\u00f3n participativa de \u00e1reas
