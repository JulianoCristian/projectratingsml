This first policy-based loan - Programmatic Power Sector Reform Loan Project - will support the initial phase of the financial recovery of the sector, to stabilize power supply, improve cash recovery, and pursue cost and arrears control. In the medium-term, lower costs and higher cash recovery would tend to reduce prices, and allow the expansion of affordable electricity service to the urban and rural poor. Nevertheless, several significant elements of risk have been identified, such as deterioration in the macroeconomic framework; erosion in both Government and public support for the reform program; continued weakness of the regulatory and policy-making institutions; continued existence of high levels of corruption; and, failure to improve performance of the nationalized EDE - power distribution company, exacerbated by continued weaknesses in the transmission network. The project will certainly improve service and access to legal electricity connections, but risks will also be minimized by engaging the private sector over the medium-term, and by the institutional strengthening support to be provided under the Power Sector Technical Assistance Loan."},"country_namecode":"Dominican
