The project also aims to contribute to poverty reduction by creating direct employment in nature conservation and by catalyzing the development of eco-tourism. The project has the following five components. Component 1) will build on the conservation planning exercise largely undertaken during the preparation phase of the project and forms the biological basis for the implementation phase. The preparatory studies focused on the systematic conservation planning exercise, freshwater conservation, proposed marine protected area (MPA), and ecological monitoring of the marine environment. The five sub-components each largely deal with park planning and will form part of the overall Integrated Environmental Management System (IEMS). Component 2) Implementation will occur in three different management scenarios: (1) SANParks land owned and managed by SANParks, (2) concessioned areas within SANParks land, and (3) contractual land adjoining the Park where SANParks may or may not manage the land. The three sub-components will roll out of the development plan, inclusive of ecological management, infrastructure development and land incorporation, to ensure effective implementation of the development plan. Component 3) includes the design, implementation and maintenance of management systems and structures to enhance Park management and strengthening/creating institutional structures for effective, participatory Park planning and program implementation. Component 4) will support implementation of the Park development plan where it relates to employment and economic benefits through communal conservation strategies, Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise (SMME) opportunities, environmental education and f"},"country_namecode":"Republic of South Africa!$!ZA","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry
