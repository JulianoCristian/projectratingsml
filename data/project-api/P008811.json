The support services will focus on: (i) the creation of an enabling policy environment for private sector participation in seed and market development; (ii) establishment of a nationwide market information system; (iii) establishment of farmer information and advisory services. The role of the private sector will be demonstrated by selective 'pilot' investments in hybrid corn and sunflower seed enterprises, fruit and vegetable marketing bases and vegetable storage facilities. The provision of critical support service, the development of analytical capacity and demonstration of the commercial viability of participating private enterprises are expected to lay the foundation for an efficient agricultural sector based on private ownership and market principle."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":32},"theme1":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"240,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"YA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Rural development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,25,75,33","mjthemecode":"3,10,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":68},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":32}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200144819","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200144819","DocURL":"22-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200144819","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200144819","DocDate":"22-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99e33_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99e33_1_0","DocDate":"16-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005203959","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005203959","DocDate":"31-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005203724","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005203724","DocDate":"31-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100525002307","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100525002307","DocDate":"31-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052712020125","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052712020125","DocDate":"08-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2006061412574839","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2006061412574839","DocDate":"05-NOV-1991"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
