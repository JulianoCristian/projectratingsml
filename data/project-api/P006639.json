The project constitutes the second phase in the Bank's lending assistance in the sector and it has four principal components. The first is the decentralization of health services delivery which will finance the pilot tests or start-up activities and nationwide implementation, as appropriate, of the reorganization of the Ministry of Health (MOH). The second is facility investments for a new health care model which will enhance the integration of health services delivery in eight Health Service Areas (HAS). The third is support for special programs which would mean the financing of equipment and operating costs for the implementation of the Cervical Cancer Program and Environmental Health Education Program. Finally, the fourth is project administration, this will support the operation of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to assist the MOH to coordinate and manage project implementation, provide training to the HASs, and undertake monitoring evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"67,26","mjthemecode":"2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00032306211760","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00032306211760","DocDate":"03-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122555322","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122555322","DocURL":"15-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122555121","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122555121","DocDate":"15-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122554819","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122554819","DocURL":"15-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122555020","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122555020","DocURL":"15-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122555322","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122555322","DocDate":"15-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122554819","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122554819","DocDate":"15-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122555020","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122555020","DocDate":"15-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003053257","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003053257","DocDate":"23-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003053124","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003053124","DocDate":"23-OCT-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile"}},"facets":{}}
