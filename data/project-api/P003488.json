The project, to be carried out over five years supports various components.  They include development of about 27,000 ha of idle land; improvement or extension of existing infrastructure; construction of about 343,000 square metres of buildings; and provision of construction and farm machinery as well as other vehicles.  In addition, project components include development of more than 22,000 ha of cultivated area with crops as well as rehabilitation of tea plantations; provision of purebred stock and feed; rehabilitation or construction of agroprocessing factories; provision of equipment; and a pilot program of research and demonstration.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected primarily from increases in agricultural production and productivity which in turn will increase the average per capita income of the largely household farm beneficiaries by 330 percent at full project."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u7ea2\u58e4\u5730\u533a\u5f00\u53d1\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u534e\u5357\u7ea2\u58e4\u5730\u533a\u5df2\u5229\u7528\u571f\u5730\uff0c\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u62df\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5730\u533a\u5f00\u59cb\u79cd\u690d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f5c\u7269\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u755c\u7267\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u652f\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u4e3a\u671f\u4e94\u5e74\uff0c\u8bbe\u6709\u591a\u9879\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5f00\u53d12.7\u4e07\u516c\u9877\u5de6\u53f3\u95f2\u7f6e\u571f\u5730\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u6539\u9020\u6216\u5ef6\u4f38\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u65b0\u5efa\u7ea634.3\u4e07\u5e73\u65b9\u7c73\u5efa\u7b51\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u65bd\u5de5\u673a\u68b0\u548c\u519c\u4e1a\u673a\u68b0\u53ca\u5176\u5b83\u8bbe\u5907\u6216\u8f66\u8f86\uff1b\uff085\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u8d85\u8fc72.2\u4e07\u516c\u9877\u519c\u4f5c\u7269\u79cd\u690d\u533a\uff0c\u6539\u9020\u8336\u56ed\uff1b\uff086\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u79cd\u755c\u548c\u9972\u6599\uff1b\uff087\uff09\u8bd5\u70b9\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u793a\u8303\u3002\u9884\u8ba1\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u76ca\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u519c\u4e1a\u4ea7\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u9879\u76ee\u5b8c\u5168\u5c55\u5f00\u4e4b\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u70b9\u53c8\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u53d7\u76ca\u519c\u6237\u7684\u4eba\u5747\u6536\u5165\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926003803","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926003803","DocDate":"25-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36b9f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36b9f_1_0","DocDate":"09-SEP-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36b9d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36b9d_1_0","DocDate":"09-SEP-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702134501","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702134501","DocDate":"31-AUG-1986"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
