Approximately 21,000 farm families, about 90% of whom have incomes below the poverty line, will benefit, with incomes expected to quadruple by full development in 1991. The project will tap the potential of two existing reservoirs (Lam Pao and Lam Takhong) through the construction or improvement of diversion dams, main, lateral and tertiary canals, drains, and facilities. Consultants will be employed to assist in project implementation, to monitor benefits and to prepare future projects. The project faces no special risks, although realization of expected benefits will depend on the pace with which farmers adopt improved technologies made possible by the reliable water supply. This report comprises two impact evaluation for the Philippines a Thailand, and an overview which synthesizes the findings of both impac evaluations regarding the extent of, and reasons for, sustainability. compares the impact of irrigation system design on project performance projects consisted of rehabilitation and expansion of existing irrigat schemes and aimed at providing year round and reliable irrigation wate both the wet and dry seasons. These countries were reviewed together they both represent the use of less intensive technology for rice prod Surveys were undertaken in both countries, involving a minimum of 300 beneficiaries. Among other things the surveys sought to determine and the beneficiaries' perception of their past and present welfare and qu life. Other areas reviewed by the impact evaluations include : 1) over performance of the irrigation and drainage system; 2) overall economic agricultural performance; 3) institutional performance; 4) social impa 5) environmental impact."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"17,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925024823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925024823","DocDate":"09-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902314778","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902314778","DocDate":"30-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3af_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3af_1_0","DocDate":"14-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191238106","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191238106","DocDate":"31-OCT-1978"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
