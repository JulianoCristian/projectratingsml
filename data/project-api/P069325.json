The project has five components: 1) The first component will provide support to re-establishing the national cattle herd through the procurement of 2,300 cattle. 2) Rehabilitation of veterinary services will be implemented through the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Project Management Team. Private veterinarians will be supported in equipment and drugs, and the support to public veterinary services will include the establishment of central and regional veterinary diagnostic laboratories, as well as a facility to ensure artificial insemination services. 3) Farm machinery repair and replacement will help rebuild the power capacity for agricultural production through a tractor repair program and the distribution of new equipment. 4) Agriculture policy capacity building will support the technical assistance of the Department of Agriculture in agriculture trade polices, and preparation for investments in irrigation rehabilitation in the near term. 5) Project management will support a team made up of local and international staff and will work closely with non-governmental organizations.
