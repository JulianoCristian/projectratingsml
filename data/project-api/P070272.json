The extension is necessary to ensure that critical activities financed not only by the International Development Association (IDA) credit but also by the European Commission Trust Fund (ECTF) can be completed in an orderly manner. Failure to process the proposed six-month extension will jeopardize achievement of the project objective of 'increased and more equitable enrollment' as well as 'enhanced quality in elementary and secondary education'.
