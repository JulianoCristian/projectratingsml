While focusing on seven states, the project benefits aquaculture producers, traders, and processors throughout Mexico. It has two components: (1) The first helps complete and implements the government's regulatory framework, and provides key public goods to stimulate productive sector (private and social) investment. Its four subcomponents are: (i) regulatory framework, (ii) environmental and coastal resources management, (iii) public goods and services, and (iv) institutional strengthening and project coordination. (2) The second component, incorporating the Social Strategy and Indigenous Peoples Development Plan, supports productive investments and training for residents of \"ejidos,\" cooperatives, communal land groups, and other economically disadvantaged producers, and develops an appropriate institutional framework that creates a more level playing field for social sector participation in aquaculture. This component includes two subcomponents: (i) social aquaculture production, and (ii) institutional development. The project will support investments in aquaculture parks and hatcheries, create limited liability corporations to manage them, and train management staff."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":63},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Project Information Document,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"JB,AB,BC,AJ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"60,40,82,79","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,11,4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":63},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":9},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000094946_0102020542297","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0102020542297","DocDate":"26-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229185504","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229185504","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200302147","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200302147","DocURL":"24-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200302449","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200302449","DocURL":"24-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200302348","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200302348","DocDate":"24-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200302147","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200302147","DocDate":"24-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818103031","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818103031","DocDate":"28-MAR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135556","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135556","DocDate":"30-JUN-1994"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
