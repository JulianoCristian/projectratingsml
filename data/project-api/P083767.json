The closing date of the project will be extended from December 31, 2010 until December 31, 2011. This will be the second extension of the project which will bring the cumulative closing date extension up to two years. A one-year extension of the closing date and a reallocation of funding are necessary to further support the Palestinian Authority (PA) in their continued efforts to improve the tertiary education system. As a result of currency fluctuations, there is an additional US$700,000 of grant proceeds which have not been committed. An extension and reallocation will be essential to finance a first and thorough evaluation of ongoing academic programs in science and humanities in Tertiary Education Institutions (TEIs)."},"country_namecode":"West Bank and Gaza!$!GZ","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
