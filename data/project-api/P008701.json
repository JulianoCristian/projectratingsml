The part of the production of Section I that will not be used in Section II, i.e. 4,730 tpy will sold as roving and yarn. The plant will located in Militari, an area that is being developed as an industrial estate and provides common facilities for the supply of utilities. The project will use the direct-melt process where continuous glass filaments are drawn directly from the molten glass. Know-how, machinery and equipment for Section I will be supplied under a turn-key contract which will also provide for erection supervision, training and start-up assistance by the foreign contractor."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"18,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3970723102558","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970723102558","DocDate":"28-JAN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84b0d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84b0d_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUN-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902284230","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902284230","DocDate":"31-MAY-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101911561216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101911561216","DocDate":"30-APR-1977"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
