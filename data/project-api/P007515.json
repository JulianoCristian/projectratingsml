Water supplies and better water management would be assured for approximately 203,000 hectares of which 12,700 hectares would be double cropped. The total cost of the project is estimated at the equivalent of about $95 million. The proposed Bank loan of $25 million represents the presently estimated foreign exchange component of the civil works portion of the project, as explained in the appraisal report.
