It will help alleviate poverty by increasing the income of currently underemployed farmers. The project will also benefit the environment by improving soil and water conservation, reducing erosion and promoting sustainable land use and agricultural practices. It will support the integrated development of paddy, upland and forest areas, totalling some 52,500 ha in 217 small watersheds. The main features of the project are: (a) land development including vegetative and structural soil/water conservation treatments and on-farm irrigation canals and pumping stations, rural electrification, roads and biogas units; (b) crop establishment and forestry including fruit and nut orchards, mulberry, tea and paddy rehabilitation and fodder crops; (c) livestock and aquaculture including dairy cattle, pigs and fish ponds; (d) agroprocessing and marketing including feed mills, fruit and vegetable processing and packing lines, cold storage and tea processing; and (e) support for research, extension and training."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
