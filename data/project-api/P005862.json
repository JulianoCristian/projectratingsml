It would establish a program of hydrometeorological observations in Wadi Beihan for improving knowledge of its water resources and ensuring their optimal utilization. In addition, it would improve access between agricultural and population centers in Wadi Beihan by constructing feeder roads, and improve the nutrition of the local population by increasing production of fruits, vegetables and meat. The project would benefit directly 5,000 families. In addition, 15,000 persons would benefit indirectly from the project through the increased availability of foodstuffs and easier access to markets and social and administrative services. The principal risks of not achieving the project's objectives are associated with an unsustainable rate of drawdown of groundwater in the project area and delays in realizing full production benefits. The project has been designed to minimize these risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925072615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925072615","DocDate":"17-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e042bd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e042bd_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902373890","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902373890","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912533188","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912533188","DocDate":"30-APR-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
