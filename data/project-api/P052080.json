The project consists of four components. 1) Technical assistance to private and communal sector forestry will finance technical assistance, training, workshops, studies, office equipment and supplies, vehicles, and operational expenses. 2) Assistance to forestry sector institutional reform will finance technical assistance and training to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. 3) Pilot subprojects will develop and test innovative activities and new mechanisms for finding solutions to priority forestry sector problems, including innovative models for reforestation and land rehabilitation, forestry resource management, increasing decentralization of forestry functions, public-private sector partnerships, creative financing mechanisms for sustainable forestry management and reforestation. The project will finance a program of grants to private sector, nongovernmental organizations, communities, and municipalities to carry out the pilot sub-projects which included specific actions for monitoring and evaluating the results of implementation. 4) The last component will finance the Project Coordination Unit, which is responsible for overall project administration."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Nicaragua!$!NI","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":32},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"NI","sectorcode":"BC,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB,PPP","themecode":"83,57,82,44","combined_practice_name":"Jobs,Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,11,7,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB,PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":68},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":32}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050216133922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050216133922","DocDate":"20-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060112333583","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060112333583","DocDate":"30-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2010022514493363","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022514493363","DocURL":"19-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022514493363","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022514493363","DocDate":"19-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910544177","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910544177","DocDate":"09-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99092004315755","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99092004315755","DocDate":"30-SEP-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Nicaragua","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs,Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
