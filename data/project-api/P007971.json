This would be accomplished through: (i) the improvement of three regional airports and construction of a fourth; (ii) provision on a nation-wide basis of communications, navigational and other aviation equipment including a flight inspection aircraft; and (iii) final engineering for the project airports and for a new airport at Cuzco and technical assistance for CORPAC.
