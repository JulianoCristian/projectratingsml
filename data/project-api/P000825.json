There are four components. The first helps improve maternal health services, prevents unwanted pregnancies, and prevents and controls STDs/HIV (sexually transmitted diseases and the human immunodeficiency virus). The second component aids in integrating vertical programs to combat childhood diseases through introducing and implementing the \"integrated management of childhood illnesses\" (IMCI) approach. The third component supports nutrition policy formulation and institutional strengthening; as well as community and micronutrient approaches to improve the nutritional status of women and young children. The fourth component supports the management and implementation of a family health program by capacity building and policy development, upgrading and maintaining health infrastructure--rebuilding selected primary health care facilities, establishing a blood supply system, procuring equipment, maintenance support, a local fund initiative fund, and project management. Capacity will be built in the areas of cost recovery; information, education, and communication; monitoring and evaluation; and research application."},"country_namecode":"Republic of The Gambia!$!GM","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":16},"theme4":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"18,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GM","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,68,59,88,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060607104525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060607104525","DocDate":"22-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121311819","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121311819","DocURL":"15-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121311819","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121311819","DocDate":"15-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110506","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110506","DocDate":"02-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903283437","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903283437","DocDate":"05-NOV-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of The Gambia"}},"facets":{}}
