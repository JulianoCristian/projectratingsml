The project will finance high priority components of an emergency investment program, as follows: 1) Rehabilitation and Improvement of Water Supplv Transmission and Distribution System: (a) supply and installation of electromechanical works for the existing East Herodian well #2 (EH#2); (b) installation of about 7.5 km of 16-inches diameter ductile iron water transmission pipeline, from the well to the existing, main north-south transmission carrier; (c) installation of about 15 km of 16 to 6-inches diameter ductile iron water transmission pipeline from the existing Halhoul regional water reservoir to the western villages of Kharas and Nuba; and, (d) rehabilitation of existing water distribution networks in the western villages of Kharas and Nuba. 2) Technical Assistance: (i) strengthening of the existing Project Management Unit (PMU) within the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA), to enable it to effectively supervise project execution, and collaborate with other donors in the creation of a framework for the development of joint services councils clusters, that will be responsible for operating, and maintaining retail water distribution throughout the project area; and, (ii) preparation of designs, and bidding documents for the Dura and Yatta villages' distribution networks, for implementation under a proposed follow-up project."},"country_namecode":"West Bank and Gaza!$!GZ","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"12,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Brief,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Technical Annex,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GZ","sectorcode":"BH,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Human development","Urban development","Urban development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,71,73,70,85","mjthemecode":"11,8,9,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090814000741","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090814000741","DocDate":"29-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333038_20081029040853","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081029040853","DocDate":"01-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051312290367","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051312290367","DocDate":"27-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000012009_20030710094050","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030710094050","DocDate":"07-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03041004025750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03041004025750","DocDate":"17-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03052104055449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052104055449","DocDate":"31-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03041004025851","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03041004025851","DocDate":"27-MAR-2003"}],"countryname":"West Bank and Gaza"}},"facets":{}}
