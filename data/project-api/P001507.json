The proposed project includes the ports of Toamasina, Manakara, Tolagnaro, Toliara, Vohemar, Morondava, Mahajanga, Nosy Be, Antsiranana and Port St. Louis.  It includes (i) rehabilitation of port infrastructure; (ii) modifications and improvements to cargo handling; (iii) strengthening services to the shipping sector; and (iv) institutional development and reform.
