It consists of rehabilitation of existing water courses and extension of dikes; construction of a belt canal in Sfax and minor flood protection works in neighboring villages; provision of maintenance equipment; staffing, equipping, and operation of a unit to maintain and repair flood protection works; and provision of consulting services for related design and construction supervision. The beneficiaries of the project cannot be easily identified, since the areas of Sfax which will be affected by future floods cannot be predicted, and since these floods will also have repercussions on surrounding areas as well as on the national economy. The risk of slippage, and the consequent escalation of costs, will be minimized by supervision and close monitoring. Creation of the special unit for repair and maintenance will minimize the possibility of deterioration of flood protection infrastructure."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sewerage"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"WS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000009265_3971110141134","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971110141134","DocDate":"20-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925172605","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925172605","DocDate":"30-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000334955_20100825042020","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100825042020","DocDate":"01-JAN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902421142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902421142","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901024484","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901024484","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100324041026","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100324041026","DocDate":"27-APR-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
