The project also provides for extensions to 11 primary teacher colleges and 8 technical secondary schools. A crucial component of the project is technical assistance to Kenya in drawing up a long range development program for education, based on studies to reduce unit costs, on a consideration of manpower requirements and on an examination of the changes in curricula required to orient the education system more closely to Kenya's development needs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"6,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da570d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da570d_1_0","DocDate":"12-MAY-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903170216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903170216","DocDate":"30-APR-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903204676","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903204676","DocDate":"30-APR-1970"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
