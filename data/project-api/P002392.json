It would provide extension and other farmer services, including seed multiplication farm, vehicles and equipment, and improved production, through short and medium-term loans, of 6,000 acres of inland swamp rice, 25,000 acres of upland rice and 10,000 acres of groundnuts. It would investigate the potential of livestock development in the Northern Province, and would research methods of increasing wood fuel for future expansion of tobacco production. For the Eastern Province, the project would construct 12 market centers, additional staff houses, stores, and offices. In conjunction with improved farmer services it would provide short, medium and long-term credit to increase the production of 1,800 acres of inland swamp rice and 36,000 acres of upland rice; would develop 4,200 acres of inland swamp for rice production; and establish 1,000 acres of cocoa and 1,600 acres of smallholder oil palm.
