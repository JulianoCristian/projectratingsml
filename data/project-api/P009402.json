It would include the provision of equipment and vehicles for project implementation as well as consultants to assist the Water Development Board (WDB) in the selection, planning, design and supervision of sub-projects. The project would, in the sub-project areas, result in significant increases in annual foodgrain (mainly paddy) production ranging from 35% to 53% over current levels. While incremental increases in net farm incomes would vary by sub-project and among individual farmers, net farm incomes would in general, increase by 50% to 100%. The project would increase employment opportunities in the rural areas, primarily through changes in land use, and increase in cropping intensity and an improvement in crop yields."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924170704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924170704","DocDate":"30-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd0c3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd0c3_1_0","DocDate":"16-OCT-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902334424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902334424","DocDate":"30-SEP-1979"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
