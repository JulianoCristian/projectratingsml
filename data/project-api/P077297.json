There are three components to the project. 1) This component will finance an estimated 200 sub-projects aimed at improving local communities' infrastructure. Sub-projects will cover both rural areas (about 120) and suburban areas (about 80). Eligible sub-projects, which will be based on the priorities of communities, will include rural and suburban roads, water supply, sewerage, lighting, pedestrian and rural bridges, market-places, buildings (e.g., health centers, schools, day care facilities, cultural centers), and parks. 2)  This component will finance training and technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of local government, communities, and Albanian Development Fund (ADF) staff. It will include three programs: capacity building for ADF staff; local government and community capacity building, and a participation pilot program. The pilot program will introduce methods of participatory planning and participatory monitoring and evaluation. It is expected that this program would subsequently be rolled out to other parts of the country. 3) This component will support the implementation of the Community Works Project (CWP) by ADF by financing a portion of ADF's operating costs (maintenance and operation of equipment procured or used under the project; salaries paid to ADF staff, other than civil servants' salaries, hired for purposes of the project; and consumable office supplies, communications, fuel, travel and per diem allowances)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"AL","sectorcode":"WZ,BH,JB,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,78,62,57","mjthemecode":"7,7,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000386194_20120712013437","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120712013437","DocDate":"29-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090527034311","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090527034311","DocDate":"30-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004092714423665","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004092714423665","DocURL":"24-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042214542366","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042214542366","DocDate":"24-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004092714423665","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004092714423665","DocDate":"24-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0305170413410","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0305170413410","DocDate":"31-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20030605103225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030605103225","DocDate":"29-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03052804031319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052804031319","DocDate":"20-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03061010442289","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03061010442289","DocDate":"20-MAY-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Albania"}},"facets":{}}
