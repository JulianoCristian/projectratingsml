Specifically, the project will: (i) upgrade the telecommunications system between the country's principal population and commercial centers; (ii) improve the international gateway access through the provision of 100 international lines; (iii) replace obsolete equipment that is no longer practicable to maintain; (iv) introduce modern and appropriate technology that is less maintenance intensive than existing equipment; (v) provide basic infrastructure for the subsequent development of rural telecommunications; and (vi) provide sufficient capacity on the national and international network to remove bottlenecks and ensure that capacity is in place to handle forecasted traffic growth."},"country_namecode":"Samoa!$!WS","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"4,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"WS","sectorcode":"CC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","code":"CC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961219133937","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219133937","DocDate":"22-AUG-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121504798","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121504798","DocDate":"02-AUG-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121504798","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121504798","DocURL":"02-AUG-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08030_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08030_1_0","DocDate":"08-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927182328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927182328","DocDate":"31-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927182425","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927182425","DocDate":"15-MAY-1989"}],"countryname":"Samoa"}},"facets":{}}
