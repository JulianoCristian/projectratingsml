In addition to preventing the collapse of the existing wharf, the main benefits are additional earnings from cruise ships and from the on-shore expenditures of their passengers. The most significant risk is that traffic development may not take place as rapidly as expected. This risk is minimized by avoiding over-investment through a staged construction program. The main benefit is to improve access to communities not linked to the main road network. The main risk is that traffic will not develop as rapidly as expected. Risks are reduced by holding investments to a minimum and by institutional assistance to the maritime sector to foster the growth of coastal shipping."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Haiti!$!HT","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HT","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902364265","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902364265","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04283_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04283_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04281_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04281_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912520751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912520751","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Haiti"}},"facets":{}}
