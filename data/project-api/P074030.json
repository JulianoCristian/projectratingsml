The AF will help finance costs associated with the completion of some of the activities that could not be funded under the TSP due to higher than expected costs, cost overruns and consequent financing gap. The AF is consistent with the Pilot Crisis Response Window (PCRW) objectives to assist eligible countries in providing financial assistance to protect core spending on health, education, social safety nets, infrastructure and agriculture. Particularly, the proposed activities will serve to finance core infrastructure development needs identified before the financial crisis that are critical for economic growth. The AF is expected to be quickly implemented as the preparation of the project is at an advanced stage. Finally, the AF continues to also support Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which is aligned with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) pillars in: (i) minimizing economic vulnerability and promoting growth through economic transformation; and (ii) promoting shared growth through improved social service delivery; and as cross-cutting issues: (i) governance and capacity development; and (ii) demography."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
