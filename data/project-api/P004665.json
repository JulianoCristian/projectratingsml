A limited program of diploma level training is included in the project to produce each year some 110 agricultural technicians from four of the agricultural schools and 25 teachers from the Bang Pra Teacher Training College. At the same time, a higher agricultural education program is being established in the universities. In-service teacher training programs are also to be established at Bang Pra to raise the level of instruction in the agricultural schools. The importance of these schools to agriculture will also be increased by the establishment of advisory committees to coordinate their teaching with extension and the other services of the Ministry of Agriculture."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67d63_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67d63_1_0","DocDate":"19-OCT-1966"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902564288","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902564288","DocDate":"30-SEP-1966"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903482174","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903482174","DocDate":"30-SEP-1966"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
