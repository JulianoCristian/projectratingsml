The project would be located in the South-West of the Ivory Coast close to the new port of San Pedro, which would provide easy access to ocean transportation for the processed rubber. The plantation would lie astride the main coastal road to Tabou, on the Liberianborder. It is an integral part of the Ivory Coast's plan for the development of this region, one of the least developed and sparsely inhabited parts of the Ivory Coast. Laborers for the plantation are expected, however, to come from elsewhere in the Ivory Coast and from Upper Volta and Mali."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire!$!CI","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"8,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"CI","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902200468","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902200468","DocDate":"31-MAR-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903193965","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903193965","DocDate":"31-MAR-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e726e6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e726e6_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6aa96_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6aa96_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1973"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire"}},"facets":{}}
