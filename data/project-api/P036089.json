These broad objectives will be achieved through activities and reforms under the following three project components: 1) health finance and management; 2) basic health services; and 3) pharmaceutical policy and supply. The specific objectives of these three components are as follows, respectively: 1) to build capacity to analyze and apply information for policy-making and health system management; 2) to strengthen primary health care and support high-priority disease prevention and health promotion programs; and 3) to reduce the cost of essential drugs by creating a more competitive pharmaceutical market."},"country_namecode":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of!$!MK","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":54},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":16},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"16,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MK","sectorcode":"BK,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Rural development","Human development","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"89,93,67,78,63","mjthemecode":"8,10,8,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":54},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":34},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20030630111113","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20030630111113","DocDate":"10-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123411483","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123411483","DocURL":"24-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123411483","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123411483","DocDate":"24-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123411584","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123411584","DocDate":"24-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214123024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214123024","DocDate":"24-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of"}},"facets":{}}
