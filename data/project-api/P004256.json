In addition, by strengthening agricultural support services, the yield and incomes of all 60,000 padi farming families in the Muda area, or 340,000 people, will be improved. To achieve these aims, the proposed project would provide financing for: (a) construction of tertiary canal and drainage systems and farm roads in 37 discrete irrigation blocks; (b) improvements to major outfall drains and natural channels; (c) rehabilitation of coastal bunds; (d) construction of tidal gates, water control structures and escape structures; (e) upgrading of the existing water control communications system; (f) construction of workshops, administration buildings and seed stores; (g) pilot projects, engineering and management studies, a groundwater study and a rural development project feasibility study; (h) purchase of vehicles and equipment for project works and studies; and (i) consultant services and training."},"country_namecode":"Malaysia!$!MY","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"31,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MY","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924214500","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924214500","DocDate":"28-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924214415","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924214415","DocDate":"23-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e474_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e474_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902330435","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902330435","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Malaysia"}},"facets":{}}
