The project would also provide the basis for better water management in the State. It would furthermore improve the data base for planning future irrigation projects in Madhya Pradesh. The project would consist of: construction, over a five-year period, of medium irrigation projects throughout the State; flow monitoring and evaluation studies; water management areas; training of management staff; technical services for the planning and design of the distribution system; and demonstration farms for irrigated agriculture. The project would increase agricultural production and the standard of living of the farmers in Madhya Pradesh. The risks under the proposed project are those normally associated with irrigation projects in India."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"140,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04560_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04560_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0455d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0455d_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902365596","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902365596","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191252404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191252404","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
