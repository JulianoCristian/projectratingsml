Within this context, the project components will: 1) improve case adjudication and access to justice, through the implementation of modern case management techniques, planning and tools, and the upgrading of information and communication systems. Case management reform will include electronically integrating court processes, enabling analysis of cases, and case management performance of the courts; 2) enhance institutional integrity, by a) strengthening the Code of Ethics for justices, judges, lawyers and court personnel; (b) strengthening the monitoring of the conduct, operations and performance of judges, lawyers and court personnel; (c) implementing the computerized Judicial Performance Management System, within the pilot model courts, and higher courts of the judiciary; and, (d) implementing a gender-sensitive Human Resources and Development Master Plan for non-judicial personnel, strengthening the overall capacities of the Philippine Judicial Academy as well; 3) strengthen institutional capacity through the implementation of a decentralized administration model for the judiciary; installing comprehensive computer-based financial, and administrative systems; developing model integrated court facilities; and strengthening policy, research, and development capabilities, including the establishment of an electronic judicial library; and, 4) assist in strengthening support for the reform process, ensuring that judges, and other stakeholders are able to participate in the development, and implementation of key reform activities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the
