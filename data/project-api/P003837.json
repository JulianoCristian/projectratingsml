The project would include:  (a) the provision of integrated basic services such as roads, footpaths, water supply and sanitation, primary schools and health clinics in low income neighborhoods (known as Kampungs); (b) improvements in solid waste management and surface drainage; municipal management studies in financial planning, programming and budgeting, operations and maintenance, cost recovery and revenue generation; and (d) technical assistance for project implementation and preinvestment and feasibility studies.  The project would provide improved basic services to 1.2 million residents of the four cities. About 760,000 would benefit from the kampung improvement program.  Another 400,000 would share in the benefits of the solid waste disposal program, which would provide a cleaner physical environment and reduce health risks, and the drainage improvement program, which would minimize the risks of property damage, illness and loss of life arising from periodic flooding."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"39,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"UM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban management","code":"UM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925201730","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925201730","DocDate":"24-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99d06_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99d06_1_0","DocDate":"08-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902441580","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902441580","DocDate":"30-APR-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
