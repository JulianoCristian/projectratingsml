This project aims to a) maintain and consolidate the recent reforms in primary education and in demand-driven training and apprenticeship programs initiated under the earlier project; and b) assist the government of Cape Verde in carrying out a comprehensive sector study, addressing issues of quality and equity, in order to identify cost-effective options for the sustainable development of the education/training system (ETS) through the medium term. The project also provides the underpinnings for a human resource development program which the Government intends to launch in 2001. The project has four components. The first reinforces the integration of basic education by improving primary school infrastructure and increasing textbook supply and teacher guides; and reinforces training and apprenticeship programs, strengthening the sector's policy and advisory bodies and improving the quality and efficiency of employment surveys and job placement services. The second component funds a qualitative assessment of education subsectors. The third component supports field-testing of selected options; and supports consultation, information, and communication. The fourth component builds the capacity of the education and the employment and training ministries."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cabo Verde!$!CV","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":29},"sector2":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":23},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":22},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CV","sectorcode":"EZ,BC,EV,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"61,66,57,65","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,7,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":29},{"Name":"Education","Percent":26},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":23},{"Name":"Education","Percent":22}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050318095236","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050318095236","DocDate":"28-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201063411","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201063411","DocURL":"03-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201063411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201063411","DocDate":"03-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99052608145863","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99052608145863","DocDate":"30-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00081705310170","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081705310170","DocDate":"12-NOV-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cabo Verde","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
