This will be pursued by: 1) expanding access to junior secondary education in a cost-effective and equitable way; 2) improving the quality of junior secondary education; and 3) strengthening the education management capacity at all levels. To meet these objectives, the following components and subcomponents will be implemented selectively and in varying degrees in the public and private systems of the five project provinces: DI Aceh, West Sumatra, Jambi, South Sumatra, and Lampung. The first objective will involve: 1) creation of a total of 53,520 student school places; 2) gradual expansion of alternative equivalency programs; 3) student and teacher accommodations for public schools in rural and remote areas; and 4) financing of scholarships for 32,600 talented poor students with priority given to girls. The second objective will require: 1) strengthening of teachers' subject-matter knowledge and pedagogical skills; 2) enhancement of learning environment; and 3) provision of contract teachers for rural areas. The third objective will be achieved by: 1) training school principals and other administrators in managing schools and providing pedagogical support to teachers; and 2) developing managerial and data analysis capacity."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"98,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BH,BC,ET,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"65,59,78","mjthemecode":"10,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":75},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20060810124747","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060810124747","DocDate":"08-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050701123538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050701123538","DocDate":"30-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200273735","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200273735","DocURL":"07-NOV-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200273936","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200273936","DocURL":"07-NOV-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019225048","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019225048","DocDate":"16-AUG-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
