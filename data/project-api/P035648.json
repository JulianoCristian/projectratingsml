There are three project components. The first not only strengthens municipal management but also improves municipal support capacity of line ministries and implementing agencies, privatizes urban services, prepares historic preservation activities, establishes the local information/communication system, and supports reform of the urban management regulatory framework. The second component supports basic infrastructure by improving the urban road network through paving and drainage; funding technical studies, civil works supervision, and financing technical/financial audits of works; and strengthening small and medium enterprises. The third component strengthens community participation by building basic neighborhood infrastructure, funding community-based activities, and supporting community initiatives."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":39},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":39},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"25,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"JB,BH,TA,WS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Urban development","Rule of law","Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"74,33,71,73,57","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"7,9,9,3,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":39},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":39},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050404135446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050404135446","DocDate":"30-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123545426","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123545426","DocURL":"01-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123545325","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123545325","DocURL":"01-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123545527","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123545527","DocURL":"01-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123545325","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123545325","DocDate":"01-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123545426","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123545426","DocDate":"01-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123545527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123545527","DocDate":"01-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99060411142751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99060411142751","DocDate":"13-MAY-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
