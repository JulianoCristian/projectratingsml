The project has the following two components: Component 1) The SPDF is a term lending facility which will be established and will be operated by the two financial intermediaries (Fls). The two Fls selected are: (a) Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi (TSKB) - the Turkish Industrial Development Bank (private); (b) Turkiye Kalkinma Bankasi (TKB) - the Turkish Development Bank (Government) The World Bank loan for the SPDF will be on-lent from Treasury (the Borrower) to the Fls. The Fls will utilize the SPDF to provide long-term debt financing to private sponsors of renewable energy projects. The SPDF is intended to leverage equity investment from local private developers, export credit financing and other financing for the construction and operation of qualified renewable generation projects. Component 2) In order to support the implementation of the Project, Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR), General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) and General Directorate of Electrdic Power Resources (EIE) will undertake various institutional development activities. These activities will be financed through internal sources and grants. The World Bank and the Government will work together to obtain the required grant financing for these activities. The principal institutional development activities that will be pursued include: (a) Renewable Energy Development Capacity: For the immediate to medium-term (next 2-3 years) there is a substantial potential pipeline of projects which are at an advanced stage of development by private sponsors. (b) Legislation for Renewable Energy Resource Development: Apart from the Electricity Market"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"202,030,000","sector":[{"Name":"Renewable energy"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"BC,FE,LE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,34,81,44","mjthemecode":"4,11,3,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":50},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100422021130","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100422021130","DocDate":"09-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000013846_2010041509524031","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000013846_2010041509524031","DocDate":"05-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"007745231_2007062108360831","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007745231_2007062108360831","DocURL":"05-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20040309095924","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040309095924","DocDate":"26-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_04020604012720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_04020604012720","DocDate":"04-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0303220424337","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0303220424337","DocDate":"31-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02050204345036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02050204345036","DocDate":"25-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052614070023","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052614070023","DocDate":"17-JAN-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
