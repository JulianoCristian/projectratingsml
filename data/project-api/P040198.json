The project consists of three components. First, community-based subprojects will support pre-investment feasibility studies for small-scale infrastructure and services subprojects, such as schools, health posts, water supply, sanitation and latrine systems, bridges, and cultural heritage. Second, community training will provide training for beneficiaries, and local staff of line ministries and municipalities. Third, institutional development will support consultancies to promote participatory planning, women's participation in FIS subprojects. It will also finance the decentralization of the FIS operation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guatemala!$!GT","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":13},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GT","sectorcode":"TA,JA,JB,WZ,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"51,60,57,78,56","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,10,7,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":50},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":13},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":13},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":12},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040625164115","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040625164115","DocDate":"22-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052411550651","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052411550651","DocDate":"22-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042816020154","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042816020154","DocDate":"22-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032916300653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032916300653","DocDate":"22-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052411582942","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052411582942","DocDate":"22-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000178830_9811170355323","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9811170355323","DocDate":"26-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173706","DocDate":"11-AUG-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guatemala","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
