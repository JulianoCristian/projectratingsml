The second series of PRSO4-7 and related policy dialogue, policy matrix and performance assessment framework, builds on the achievements of the previous series, deepens structural reforms on public financial management, and expands supporting the delivery of further benefits in two broad categories: (i) investment climate, competitiveness, and business development; and (ii) public finance management and improving service delivery. Progress in these policy areas in turn will support a continuation of the good macroeconomic situation and sustainable export and private sector driven growth, and continued progress with poverty reduction, including through reform of the public finance management system (as well as better management of natural resource revenues including those of Second Nam Theun (hydroelectric project) (NT2)). As programmatic budget support, the PRSO series is aimed at increased predictability of funding and the associated dialogue between Government and donors, sharper policy prioritization and strengthened donor coordination."},"country_namecode":"Lao People's Democratic Republic!$!LA","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":16},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme5":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"LA","sectorcode":"JA,EZ,LZ,BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"65,27,30,49,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,5,2,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":13},{"Name":"Education","Percent":13},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20121219011444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20121219011444","DocDate":"05-OCT-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2008120211022876","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008120211022876","DocDate":"25-JUL-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2008120211022876","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008120211022876","DocURL":"25-JUL-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20080528022439","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080528022439","DocDate":"15-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20080403162221","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080403162221","DocDate":"20-MAR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20080403162141","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080403162141","DocDate":"04-DEC-2007"}],"countryname":"Lao People's Democratic Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
