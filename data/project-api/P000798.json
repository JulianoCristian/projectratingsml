First, it would reduce Gambia's present substantial rice imports by increasing the local production of pump-irrigated rice. Second, it would prepare an integrated agricultural development project based on ongoing and additional studies and on improved agricultural experimentation. The proposed credit would help finance: (a) development of 3,000 acres of land for double-cropping of rice under pump irrigation. Credit would be provided for irrigation equipment as well as the seed and fertilizer needed for the first crop. Field staff would be trained and strengthened and staff housing constructed. (b) preparation of studies to include: (i) identification of areas suitable for swamp rice production, ground survey of selected swamps, design of flood control works and related costs estimates, and the implementation of such works in one or two swamps to test designs; (ii) improving agricultural experimental facilities at Sapu for rainfed crops, swamp rice, and alternative crops for the present irrigated rice schemes; and (iii) preparing designs and cost estimates for a feeder road system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of The Gambia!$!GM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"1,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GM","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000009265_3970904163106","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904163106","DocDate":"13-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912223772","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912223772","DocDate":"21-SEP-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de30ed_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de30ed_1_0","DocDate":"12-SEP-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902191573","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902191573","DocDate":"31-AUG-1972"}],"countryname":"Republic of The Gambia"}},"facets":{}}
