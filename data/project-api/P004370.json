Under the project, 3700 ha of oil palm plantation, 750 ha of cocoa plantation and 1000 ha of peripheral smallholder oil palm blocks will be developed in the Milne Bay Province.  The project will also provide for the necessary processing facilities and infrastructural support, including construction of an oil palm mill, a cocoa fermentary, and improvements in project area roads and bridges. It will also improve the quality of life for the poorer inhabitants of the province by providing health, education and housing facilities.  The project is expected to increase PNG's annual exports of palm oil and kernel by about US$13 million and cocoa by US$2 million.  The project faces no special risks."},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine!$!PG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"27,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PG","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094734","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094734","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101410","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101410","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"}],"countryname":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine"}},"facets":{}}
