Such capacity development will be critical to the overall success of the HSSP in improving health services delivery and outcomes. There has been considerable delay in project implementation and although the grant became effective on July 14, 2008, with the exception of the purchase of a new photocopier, no expenditure had occurred. The Ministry acknowledges the delay was mostly due to lack of understanding of the project arrangements within the Ministry itself and to a high turnover of senior staff in 2009. As outlined in the aide memoire from the April mission, good progress is now being made as a result of assistance under the grant and Ministry staffs are committed to maximizing the Bank's technical support. The initial withdrawal application is being submitted and further withdrawal applications will follow regularly. The contract for the financial management specialist, management training and other assistance will occur throughout the calendar year 2011. Extending the grant to December 31, 2011 will enable effective use of grant resources as outlined in the attached revised procurement and training plans."},"country_namecode":"Solomon Islands!$!SB","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":63},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":27},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"1,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Procurement Plan,Project Information Document","countrycode":"SB","sectorcode":"JA,BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0002108831","geoLocName":"Guadalcanal Province","latitude":"-9.6333303","longitude":"160.2","country":"SB"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"67","mjthemecode":"8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":63},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":27},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20120706004702","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120706004702","DocDate":"29-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b0812c8d8c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0812c8d8c_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20110722010232","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110722010232","DocDate":"12-JUL-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011051116235102","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011051116235102","DocDate":"11-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20100928234622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100928234622","DocDate":"14-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20100928234153","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100928234153","DocDate":"07-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2008100309403897","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008100309403897","DocURL":"14-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2008100309403897","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008100309403897","DocDate":"14-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000333038_20080306031000","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080306031000","DocDate":"19-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000020953_20080519114112","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20080519114112","DocDate":"12-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20060503123041","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20060503123041","DocDate":"09-MAR-2006"}],"countryname":"Solomon Islands"}},"facets":{}}
