The Bank loan will finance the foreign exchange component of FONEI financing over a period of about two years. The project will also help finance a training program on industrial project evaluation and supervision for financial intermediaries and FONEI's staff. A national study of human resources and technical and vocational training needs for further industrial development will be included in the project. The project presents a low level of risk with respect to the soundness of subprojects it will finance since FONEI is a mature financial institution; its institutional objectives may take longer to achieve. On the whole, the project presents a moderate level of risk."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"175,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e4dc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e4dc_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e4da_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e4da_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e4d9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e4d9_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902330844","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902330844","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
