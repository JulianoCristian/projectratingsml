There are four project components. 1) The first component will finance the project technical executing agency and its capacity building. 2) The second component will promote new technologies through on-farm and off-farm support services including technical feasibility studies for micro irrigation and related investments. This component focuses on providing target beneficiaries (small irrigation farmers, private operators involved in the marketing and processing of irrigation products, and providers of farm inputs and services to irrigation activities) support services aimed at increasing their incomes and employment. 3) The third component will help the target beneficiaries establish a record in the formal credit system, thereby gaining access in the future to the formal banking sector. 4) The fourth component will support the establishment of a strong monitoring and evaluation capacity. 5) The fifth component will set up a financial coordination unit, which is responsible for the financial management of the project."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"BF","sectorcode":"JB,BC,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,39,75,85,25","mjthemecode":"2,11,10,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":65},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20051104100916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051104100916","DocDate":"31-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00082405362711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082405362711","DocDate":"11-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031209541966","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031209541966","DocDate":"08-FEB-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9903250555449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903250555449","DocDate":"08-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000425962_20121113150305","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000425962_20121113150305","DocDate":"08-DEC-1998"}],"countryname":"Burkina Faso"}},"facets":{}}
