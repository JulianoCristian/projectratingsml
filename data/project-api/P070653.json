Likewise, the global environment objective seeks to promote increased understanding on the role of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, and the potential impact of various land use practices upon biodiversity, and their economic and ecological sustainability. Through the Natural Resources and Biodiversity Management Component, demand-driven activities will be financed to promote sustainable management of natural resources and biodiversity. This will be accomplished through financial and technical assistance towards improving natural resources management practices in livestock production systems, with special reference to improved management of natural pastures and biodiversity. The component will further adopt improved practices in dryland agriculture; for natural resources management systems in irrigated areas; and, in biodiversity conservation. The second component, fully financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) resources, will establish demonstration areas within the selected areas of GEF-interventions (grasslands and \"serranias\"), for a sustainable use of natural resources in key micro-catchments which are of importance for biodiversity, combining sound practices for natural resources management, and creating increased public awareness on the significance, and socioeconomic importance of biodiversity. The main objective under the third component is to develop support services that would contribute to the efficient implementation of sub-projects, financed under the previous two components.
