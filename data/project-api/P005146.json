This project finances a six-year period of the National Drainage Program (NDP), covering about 720,000 feddans (fed) and encompassing the installation or replacement of subsurface drains and the remodeling of existing open drains throughout the Nile Valley and Delta. Vertical drains will be installed as a pilot effort on 5,000 feddans. Technical assistance and training will be provided to address contractor weaknesses and to assist in the strengthening of EPADP. A coordinated monitoring and evaluation program will be introduced. Special emphasis will be given to adaptive research for drain installation in unstable soils, drainage in heavy clay soils, vertical drainage and the used of PVC pipe for collectors. In order to reduce fiscal constraints, an improved system for the recovery of investment and O&M costs related to subsurface drainage will be worked out and implemented."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Brief,Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83,78,85,84","mjthemecode":"11,11,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333037_20081030233323","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20081030233323","DocDate":"01-OCT-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20040316100252","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040316100252","DocDate":"26-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01062804081761","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01062804081761","DocDate":"16-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121564960","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121564960","DocURL":"27-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121564960","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121564960","DocDate":"27-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121564759","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121564759","DocDate":"27-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121564759","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121564759","DocURL":"27-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99bdd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99bdd_1_0","DocDate":"26-NOV-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e393da_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e393da_1_0","DocDate":"26-NOV-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001174529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001174529","DocDate":"29-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001174725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001174725","DocDate":"29-OCT-1991"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
