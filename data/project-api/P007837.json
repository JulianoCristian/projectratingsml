This will be achieved by helping to improve the policies, and expand and strengthen the operations of the Panamanian Social Emergency Fund (FES). The project's two components are: (1) providing beneficiaries in the poorest districts with high-priority, small-scale infrastructure, based on community-driven proposals; and training ministries, municipalities, and nongovernmental organizations in participatory planning, subproject maintenance, social management, operations, and environmental concerns; and (2) support three pilot programs designed to: (a) provide disadvantaged population groups nationwide with priority social services; (b) contribute nationwide to micro-enterprise development by providing credit channeled through intermediary organizations and training of their staffs; and (c) meet the nutritional needs of extremely poor children, and thereby increase school attendance in selected underserved districts through an experimental program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Panama!$!PA","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection
