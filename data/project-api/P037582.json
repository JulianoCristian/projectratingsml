These programs have the broad objectives of creating a liberalized enabling economic environment, conducive to promoting the private sector as the engine of economic growth, and decentralizing to the districts the responsibility for providing core services and fostering rural development. Within this framework, the three broad objectives of the project are to: 1) enhance analytical capacity for policy formulation and monitoring in the agricultural sector, in general, and within the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF), in particular; 2) improve the responsiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of the MAAIF in carrying out its redefined role in agricultural sector management through reforming management systems and improving internal procedures; and 3) strengthen agricultural information systems. These objectives will be implemented through three main components: 1) policy formulation and strategic planning, which will involve four sub-components: (a) analytical capacity building; (b) an Agricultural Policy Research Fund; (c) agricultural sector investment program; and (d) district planning and implementation capacity; 2) management systems reform and training including: (a) internal systems reform; (b) management reform; and (c) training fund; and 3) agricultural data and information systems strengthening."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"17,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"AB,BH,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,79","mjthemecode":"10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":78},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000090341_20041020101744","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041020101744","DocDate":"14-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031011195415","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031011195415","DocDate":"02-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022105851","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022105851","DocDate":"06-MAR-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
