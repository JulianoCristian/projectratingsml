The proposed additional grant would help finance the costs associated with an unanticipated financing gap and would consolidate the gains from the initial investments, focusing on interventions with the most significant impact with regard to HIVIAIDS prevention, treatment and care. These priority activities are consistent with the recently revised National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan and take into account the availability of funding from other development partners in an effort to assure harmonization and minimize duplication. No changes to the project objectives, components, or implementation modalities are being proposed. The project remains as originally designed and appraised. The proposed changes are marginal and consist primarily of updating the costs and financing plan. In contrast to the original project which involved co-financing with the government, the supplemental grant will finance 100 percent of the project costs, in line with the new country financing parameters for Rwanda."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Central
