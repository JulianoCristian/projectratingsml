The closing date of the project will be extended from March 31, 2013, until September 30, 2013. The extension is necessary to complete the following remaining subtasks: 1) connecting Montenegro's telecommunication system to that of Kosovo and installing the telecommunication system to the remaining internal 220-110 kV transmission lines; and 2) extension of the Mojkovac substation and connection line with transmission system. This will be the second extension of the project, resulting in a cumulative period of 18 months from the original closing date of March 31, 2012.
