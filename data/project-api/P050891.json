The project will finance foreign and Russian advisors to work with the various sector entities and government agencies and with the Electricity Reform Implementation Unit to implement the reform agenda. Technical assistance will comprise three broad categories: (1) further refining and developing the government's concept for reform and elaborating a detailed implementation plan and schedule for its realization, including an analysis of technical and institutional barriers to meeting objectives and identifying alternative solutions; (2) helping to carry out the activities needed to implement the plan; and (3) supporting the development of electricity sector entities, including commercializing operating companies and increasing their corporation-orientation, and strengthening regulators institutionally."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Technical Annex","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Urban development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,71,78,40,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,10,9,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":80},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070816100742","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070816100742","DocDate":"27-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201375946","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201375946","DocURL":"09-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201375745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201375745","DocDate":"09-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201375745","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201375745","DocURL":"09-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201375946","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201375946","DocDate":"09-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184718","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3971110141225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971110141225","DocDate":"16-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
