The three main components will: 1) improve preparedness, and responsiveness to maritime pollution, and oil spills, and, prevent ship-based pollution, through: a) improved analysis of contingency plans, using modern technology for database organization; b) extensive training in oil spill mitigation, and, in oil spill trajectory modeling; and, c) improved enforcement of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships regulations. Navigational risks will be reduced by introducing a marine electronic infrastructure program, through an enhanced vessel tracking system, and implementation of hydrographic mapping of critical zones; 2) improve knowledge base, and identify ecologically sensitive areas of marine biodiversity, by targeting programs to understand the dynamics of ocean production, and environmental degradation of the Patagonian ecosystem, including trans-boundary analysis to complete ecological identification, and inter-calibration of key marine laboratories. Marine protection tools will be developed, through analyses of regulatory, and technical aspects to pilot marine reserves, and, an action program will be developed based on the evaluation of incidental catch of birds, or mammals; and, 3) support capacity building, and dissemination practices on marine biodiversity protection, including monitoring and evaluation, and project management."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de prevenci\u00f3n de la contaminaci\u00f3n costera y gesti\u00f3n de la biodiversidad biol\u00f3gica marina (FMAM)</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":26},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":23},"theme4":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"8,350,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"AZ,TP,BC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,84,80,85,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":26},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20090821041419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090821041419","DocDate":"31-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051816442470","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051816442470","DocDate":"18-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060904004531","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060904004531","DocDate":"02-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01042011303489","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01042011303489","DocDate":"11-APR-2001"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
