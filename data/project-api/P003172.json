The project will also include a pilot rural road maintenance program, a feasibility study and, if justified, detailed engineering of either the Mansa-Kawambwa-Nchelenge road, or such other road or roads as may be agreed. The main beneficiaries will be the direct road users and the Borrower (through cost savings on restoration of bitumen roads). Two risks could affect the project's progress. The first is the possibility of delay in recruiting the requisite technical assistance for the institutions involved in road maintenance and the second is the possibility that the performance of the organization responsible for maintenance of plant and equipment may improve more slowly than expected."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"22,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c90_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c90_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228bbf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228bbf_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902293245","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902293245","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912231277","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912231277","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia"}},"facets":{}}
