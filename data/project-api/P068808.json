The project has three main components. The first funds grants to sub-projects prepared by recipients in poor rural communities and disadvantaged groups, from the following categories: small rural infrastructure (rehabilitate, upgrade, build or equip rural roads, water supply, small bridges, community centers, small-scale flood defenses, etc.); community-based social services for disadvantaged children, shelters for the homeless, home care for the disadvantaged, etc.); income generating activities; follow-up activities; and builds community capacity. The second component, which focuses on knowledge sharing and partnership building, comprises three sets of activities: 1) information, education, and communication activities; 2) building \"bridging\" social capital by creating networks of \"graduating\" community-based organizations and facilitating continued partnership between local authorities and CBos, especially in the area of sustainability; and 3) building linkages with other national poverty reduction agencies and with project s with similar set-up in the Region. The third component finances institutional strengthening activities under two sub-components: institutional support and monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":29},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":21},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"YB,WC,TA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,41,78,51","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,10,4,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":29},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":25},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":21}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070829095111","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070829095111","DocDate":"15-AUG-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201494145","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201494145","DocURL":"16-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201494145","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201494145","DocDate":"16-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01120704034240","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01120704034240","DocDate":"26-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0104270727396","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0104270727396","DocDate":"15-OCT-2001"}],"countryname":"Romania","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
