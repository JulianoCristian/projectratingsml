In addition it includes the farming of 700 acres for commercial scale crop diversification trials at the FLDA Research Centre near the Triangle. The project would bring the total planted acreage in Jengka to about 58,000 acres leaving some 35,000 acres for the third and final stage of the Jengka Triangle Program which is expected to begin in 1972. The planting of both oil palms and rubber trees take into account (i) suitability of soils within the project area and (ii) forecasts of future prices for both crops. The project would comprise a forest industry complex to extract, process and market lumber from the Jengka Triangle and after the mid 1970's from the adjacent Tekam, Berkelah and Takai forest reserves. The complex would consist of a mechanized logging unit with an annual extractive capacity of about 175,000 timber tons; a sawmill with an annual capacity of about 42,000 timber tons; a plywood mill with an annual capacity of about 60 million square feet and ancillary facilities."},"country_namecode":"Malaysia!$!MY","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"8,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MY","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912404321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912404321","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e67f41_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67f41_1_0","DocDate":"12-MAY-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67f3f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67f3f_1_0","DocDate":"12-MAY-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810190320007","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190320007","DocDate":"30-APR-1970"}],"countryname":"Malaysia"}},"facets":{}}
