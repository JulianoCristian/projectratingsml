The safety net system will provide the chronic and transient poor with both basic income support and access to opportunities for graduating out of poverty. Specifically, the credit will support the establishment of an appropriate policy framework for an efficient national safety net system, including the development of sound institutions for the effective implementation of the Benazir Income Support Program, the Government's new national safety net program. An effective the program can promote human capital development and contribute to inclusive economic growth in Pakistan. First, poor and vulnerable households will receive some relief to cope with adverse income effects of the recent crisis. The program will also provide basic income support to the chronic poor, consistent with the Government's redistributive goals. Second, Pakistan will have an established safety net system that can be scaled-up in response to future adverse economic or agro-climatic shocks. Third, in the long term the program can promote access to graduation strategies such as micro-finance, skill development programs, or basic health and education services that can help households accumulate human capital and eventually contribute to economic growth. The institution of an effective safety net system also allows policy makers to undertake much needed structural reform measures (e.g., reduction of subsidies) while protecting the poor and promoting dynamic efficiency."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","linkinfo":"<![CDATA[<RelatedLinks><ProjectImplLangCode>EN</ProjectImplLangCode><ProjectImplTitleID>1</ProjectImplTitleID><ProjectImplURLTitle>Social Protection in Pakistan - Other Relevant Information</ProjectImplURLTitle><ProjectImplURL>http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/pakistan/brief/social-protection-in-pakistan</ProjectImplURL></RelatedLinks><RelatedLinks><ProjectImplLangCode>EN</ProjectImplLangCode><ProjectImplTitleID>2</ProjectImplTitleID><ProjectImplURLTitle>World Bank in Pakistan</ProjectImplURLTitle><ProjectImplURL>http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/pakistan</ProjectImplURL></RelatedLinks>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":87},"theme2":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"53,54","mjthemecode":"6,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120726012545","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120726012545","DocDate":"29-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000386194_20120411013936","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120411013936","DocDate":"01-JAN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011062614585231","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011062614585231","DocDate":"26-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010110115424113","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010110115424113","DocDate":"01-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010050714204359","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010050714204359","DocDate":"15-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333038_20090515012705","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090515012705","DocDate":"05-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090521103752","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090521103752","DocDate":"01-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000013944_20090402111822","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000013944_20090402111822","DocDate":"02-APR-2009"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
