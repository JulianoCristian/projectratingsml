The project would increase export earnings of forestry products from the current level of US$3.9 million to about US$11 million by 1982. The project would establish logging operations over an area of 152,000 ha and process the wood in a sawmill with an annual output capacity of 17.4 million bd ft of sawn timber. The project consists of logging roads and equipment, a sawmill including repair shops and transport fleet, a waste wood power plant with a capacity of 6,000 kw, port facilities including a 13 km access road to the port, and a township for about 1,500 people. The design engineering and supervision of construction of the project would be carried out by a consulting firm which would also manage the sawmill complex during the first three years of its operation. The project includes a study for management of forest resources. It also provides for training of both operative hands and management personnel."},"country_namecode":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana!$!GY","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GY","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925024525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925024525","DocDate":"30-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e39b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e39b_1_0","DocDate":"10-OCT-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e399_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e399_1_0","DocDate":"10-OCT-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e06106_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e06106_1_0","DocDate":"10-OCT-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e06105_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e06105_1_0","DocDate":"10-OCT-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912383242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912383242","DocDate":"30-SEP-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902313658","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902313658","DocDate":"30-SEP-1978"}],"countryname":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana"}},"facets":{}}
