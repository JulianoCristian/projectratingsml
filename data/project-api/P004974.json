It advocates the creation of self-financing water utilities that would operate under concession agreements with the Government. To promote water conservation, the report recommends charging the true economic cost of the services to consumers. Until now, a national tariff structure has been applied for water services, with no provision for capital consumption and expansion. The project proposes changing this policy by levying regional tariffs that would cover both operating and maintenance costs, and the concession fees. The Government will use these fees to finance asset renewal and expansion. As large volumes of water produced are now unaccounted for, the project includes a network rehabilitation program aiming at reducing water losses. Most wastewater treatment plants in Algeria are currently inoperative. As a result, water pollution is spreading around the large urban agglomerations, damaging the natural environment. To mitigate these damages, the project proposes the rehabilitation of a number of existing wastewater treatment plants."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":27},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"110,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"BC,WS,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,40,74,84","mjthemecode":"11,9,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":70},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":27},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040708124155","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040708124155","DocDate":"30-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123034741","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123034741","DocURL":"16-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123034741","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123034741","DocDate":"16-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123035042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123035042","DocDate":"16-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123035042","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123035042","DocURL":"16-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99e00_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99e00_1_0","DocDate":"02-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005095843","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005095843","DocDate":"05-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005095631","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005095631","DocDate":"05-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
