The policy reforms that the preparation of this operation supported sought to promote greater and more informed participation at community level by ethnic minorities, the intended beneficiaries of P135-2, as well as to improve targeting, fiduciary management, transparency, and monitoring and evaluation, as primary means to achieve the poverty reduction results of these programs. This series of Program Development Objectives (DPOs) was an innovative pilot effort to use policy-based lending in support of a government National targeted program (NTP). The hypothesis was that the DPOs would be a more sustainable and far reaching means of influencing how Vietnam undertakes targeted poverty reduction work. In support of this approach was the fact that government's ownership of the program was very high, and that the operations would also leverage a substantial amount of government's own funding. Vietnam has weathered the 2008-09 global economic crises relatively well. After registering real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 5.3 percent in 2009, its economy grew by an estimated 6.8 percent in 2010. Vietnam stands out not only for achieving a higher average growth rate in the post-crisis period, but also a more stable growth path. The rapid recovery has been bolstered by higher level of investment and a strong revival in exports. Foreign direct investments have continued to remain buoyant and remittances have grown at a healthy rate. Exports are growing at 24 percent, with export of non-oil sector doing particularly well, having registered 30 percent growth in first eleven months of 2010. Overall, the recovery of the real sector of the economy has been both robust and remarkable."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":63},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":58},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":8},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"JB,BC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"53,27,57","mjthemecode":"7,2,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":63},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20121105003201","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20121105003201","DocDate":"28-SEP-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"090224b081af5c02_2_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081af5c02_2_0","DocDate":"31-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000371432_20110419155420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000371432_20110419155420","DocDate":"21-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20101206121524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20101206121524","DocDate":"08-NOV-2010"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}},"facets":{}}
