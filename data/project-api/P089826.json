While the project will help reduce poverty through the promotion of a fiscally sustained decentralization, and competitiveness program, it is subject to two main risks: a) program sustainability, and, b) macroeconomic stability. First, the continuity of program policies is supported by a number of other multilateral, and bilateral agencies, including the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), among others. Moreover, the Bank has already begun discussions with government officials, as well as potential presidential candidates about possible follow-up operations to support reforms in these areas. Second however, the combination of higher than-expected government revenues, and the upcoming election cycle could trigger expansive fiscal policies, threatening macroeconomic stability and the country's debt level. The consensus in Congress on the benefits of fiscal discipline will limit increases in public sector expenditures for the rest of this administration."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"BH,BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"45,26,27,28","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"2,2,2,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070718093826","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070718093826","DocDate":"29-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"006491766_2006073116170266","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006491766_2006073116170266","DocURL":"08-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"006491766_2006073116170266","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006491766_2006073116170266","DocDate":"08-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20051117112216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051117112216","DocDate":"08-NOV-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
