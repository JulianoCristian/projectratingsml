Despite the successful implementation to date, the extension of the New Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID) grant is necessary because of the nature of the school grant funding scheme in Tonga. Funding is allocated to schools once annually in late June. Once the schools receive their allocation, they expend the funding over time. They are monitoring the situation to ensure that a four month extension provides adequate time to expend the grant funds. Extension of the International Development Association (IDA) credit is necessary due to the late start made by Government of Tonga (GoT) in deciding to use the credit financing to allocate maintenance and rehabilitation grants to selected schools. A 12 month extension of the closing date should allow these larger maintenance and rehabilitation grants to be fully executed. An action plan for implementation of the program is attached and will be monitored."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Tonga!$!TO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government
