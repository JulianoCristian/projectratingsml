The project comprises a credit line and a technical assistance component. The credit line component will provide resources through qualified participating banks for medium-term loans to private enterprises. The technical assistance component will aim at overcoming deficiencies in: 1) bank regulation and supervision; 2) commercial banks' institutional capacity and appraisal skills; 3) the Government's capacity to reorganize/liquidate inviable state-owned enterprises; and 4) enterprise strategic planning capability. In addition, targeted assistance will be provided to ensure that sub-projects are adequately screened for environmental impact."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Lithuania!$!LT","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LT","sectorcode":"YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,43","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01032006472784","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032006472784","DocDate":"06-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200183569","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200183569","DocDate":"19-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200184475","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200184475","DocDate":"19-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200183569","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200183569","DocURL":"19-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200184274","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200184274","DocURL":"19-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200184274","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200184274","DocDate":"19-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200183770","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200183770","DocDate":"19-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200183871","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200183871","DocDate":"19-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200183972","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200183972","DocDate":"19-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200184073","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200184073","DocDate":"19-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3e0a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3e0a_1_0","DocDate":"13-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007103947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007103947","DocDate":"27-MAR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Lithuania"}},"facets":{}}
