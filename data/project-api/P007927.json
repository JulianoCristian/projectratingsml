To achieve this objective, the project will: 1) increase the coverage, quality and efficiency of basic maternal and child health services in six underserved departments in Northeastern Paraguay; 2) increase the population's knowledge about adequate health practices; 3) pilot-test a strategy to enhance early child development in Asuncion; and 4) strengthen management capability in support of an eventual decentralization of a public health services in project areas. It is expected that the project will: (a) increase the coverage and quality of institutional deliveries; (b) improve the safety of home deliveries; (c) improve the detection, transport and treatment of obstetric complications; (d) improve access to reproductive health services and information; (e) improve immunization coverage; (f) reduce the incidence of acute respiratory infections and diarrheal disease; (g) improve children's schooling readiness; and (h) increase community involvement in both health and child development activities. The components of the project are as follows: 1) maternal and child health care, including: (i) rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure and equipment; (ii) pharmaceuticals and medical supplies; (iii) information, education and communication; and (iv) training; 2) early child development pilot; and 3) strengthening management for the decentralization of health services in project areas."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Paraguay!$!PY","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":88},"sector2":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"21,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PY","sectorcode":"BC,EC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"69,26,57,67,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":88},{"Name":"Education","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050630110326","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050630110326","DocDate":"22-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200271217","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200271217","DocURL":"29-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200271418","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200271418","DocURL":"29-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200271619","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200271619","DocURL":"29-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200271720","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200271720","DocURL":"29-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214134825","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214134825","DocDate":"13-AUG-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Paraguay"}},"facets":{}}
