The 4-year time slice financed under the project includes about 168 km of rehabilitation, 100 km of widening to 2-lane standard and 1,800 km of periodic maintenance in areas west of the Jamuna. The project will also enhance the country's institutional and technical capacity to operate and maintain the main road network through: a) technical assistance for programming and supervising the project road works and for carrying out feasibility studies and other preparation activities for future road construction and improvement works; and b) an institutional development program, comprising consultancy services, twinning arrangements, officer and staff training, research and associated equipment, for RHD and other road agencies. While integrating and building upon past technical assistance, the primary focus will be improved planning, management and implementation of road works in the subsector."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"146,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01071304102541","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01071304102541","DocDate":"18-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123334974","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123334974","DocURL":"29-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123335175","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123335175","DocDate":"29-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123334974","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123334974","DocDate":"29-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123335175","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123335175","DocURL":"29-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b3f0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b3f0_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005033742","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005033742","DocDate":"03-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135438","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135438","DocDate":"26-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135439","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135439","DocDate":"26-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
