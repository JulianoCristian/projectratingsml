To this end, it will develop water management techniques replicable in other areas of the country; build within the relevant provincial agencies a capability for planning, implementing, operating, and maintaining integrated, efficient programs of irrigated agriculture; and strengthen farmer participation in water user associations.  Financing will be provided for canal rehabilitation and remodelling, drainage, on-farm water management, project management, training, and technical assistance.  Some 50,000 farm-families on about 500,000 ac of irrigated land will benefit directly from improved water resources and management, as well as deliveries of other agricultural inputs and services."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"46,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000009265_3961214174030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214174030","DocDate":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007025648","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007025648","DocDate":"08-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902443315","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902443315","DocDate":"31-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c48_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c48_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c47_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c47_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c46_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c46_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c45_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c45_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c43_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c43_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAY-1984"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
