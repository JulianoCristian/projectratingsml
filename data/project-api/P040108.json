In addition, an increased private sector participation will be pursued, through performance-based management delegation and further long term involvement of the private sector. The components include: 1) improving labor efficiency, through a voluntary separation employment package, consistent with the country's labor laws, and granted after consultation with the union; 2) increasing private sector participation. This component includes the offer of a Delegated Management Arrangement (DMA) to a corporation or consortia as the first phase in the transfer of operation and management to the private sector; 3) modernizing facilities, through the rehabilitation, refurbishment and replacement of existing equipment and/or buildings. This component includes the upgrade of counter automation and information systems; 4) strengthening institutional capacity, through disbursement of funds for the capital investment program and performance monitoring. Deregulation of postal services and implementation of the second phase of private sector participation, offering a Long Term Arrangement (LTA) for a deeper private sector involvement, are included."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Trinidad and Tobago!$!TT","sector1":{"Name":"Postal services","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
