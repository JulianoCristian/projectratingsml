In order to ensure the financial and economic viability of the rehabilitation investments, the project calls for continuing a series of policy reforms including the gradual divestiture of some of ON's agicultural activities. The reorganization of ON will help develop in-house managerial and technical competence and improve its delivery of services to farmers. Another important feature of the project will be ON's financial restructuring. The projects investments will be complemented by a program to improve applied research, resource management, training and extension. Finally, the project will finance studies including feasibility studies for the subsequent phases of the rehabilitation program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
