First, access to basic social, and communal services will be provided to improve living conditions of the target population, by empowering communities, and vulnerable groups in decision-making processes, and informed social services policies. This will be achieved through the financing of community-based services micro-projects, and targeted social-care services micro-projects. Second, assistance to the Government in social protection reform will be provided, particularly, for the preparation of a social care reform strategy. This will be achieved by strengthening the ministries of Labor and Social Policy (MLSP), and of Finance (MOF) capacity to formulate, monitor, and evaluate social care services policies, including the definition, and implementation of social care service financing, and contracting systems. Similarly, the regional authorities' capacity will also be strengthened, which should include professional training of social workers. Third, project management, and monitoring and evaluation, should ensure the efficient implementation of the project, through institutional support to the Ukrainian Social Investment Fund (USIF) Executive Office."},"country_namecode":"Ukraine!$!UA","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"50,210,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"UA","sectorcode":"EZ,WZ,JA,TA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"61,57,70,56","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090309000649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090309000649","DocDate":"31-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050416152041","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050416152041","DocDate":"21-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041511022040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041511022040","DocDate":"21-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01111404004964","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01111404004964","DocDate":"31-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00102505340714","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00102505340714","DocDate":"02-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052611065039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052611065039","DocDate":"16-FEB-2001"}],"countryname":"Ukraine","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
