The project incorporates public policy and regulatory adjustments in the areas of external trade, domestic competition, the financial sector, labor and technology.  The project would also include: (a) a private sector credit program to finance investments and technical assistance at the enterprise level and supporting services at the subsector level; and (b) programs to facilitate labor force adjustment, environmental pollution control and project monitoring support."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":3},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"BC,JB,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,45,51,44","mjthemecode":"4,6,5,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":96},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":3},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122443168","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122443168","DocURL":"22-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122443067","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122443067","DocURL":"22-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122443168","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122443168","DocDate":"22-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122443067","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122443067","DocDate":"22-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930041944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930041944","DocDate":"20-MAR-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
