It is designed to increase the productivity of the smallholder by ensuring the reliable and timely availability of fertilizer throughout Malawi. Specifically, the project would help the Government realize this objective by: (a) improving the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation's (ADMARC) procedures for procuring and distributing fertilizer; (b) establishing a fertilizer revolving fund; (c) strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and ADMARC; and (d) setting in motion a process to bring about productive reform of relevant sector policies. MOA would have overall responsibility for project implementation. About 400,000 farm families would benefit from the project. The project would also enable MOA to monitor and evaluate data on fertilizer use and crop responses in order to develop specific recommendations for individual crops, locations and categories of farmers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925161511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925161511","DocDate":"21-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901014578","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901014578","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e058fc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e058fc_1_0","DocDate":"26-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902412553","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902412553","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
