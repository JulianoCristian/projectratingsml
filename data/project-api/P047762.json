The project has three main components. The first is initiated in three districts and gradually expands to about 12 out of Tanzania's 113 districts. Activities include: support for establishing and strengthening the operational capacity (equipment support and training) of district water and sanitation teams (DWSTs) to prepare district rural water supply and sanitation plkans/plans and appraise RWSS sub-projects proposed by communities; support for establishing district RWSS funds to finance the construction of new RWSS schemes;the rehabilitation and expansion of existing systems and possibly other water-related small-scale infrastructure investments; and assistance to communities in properly managing and operating these systems through apprpriate hygiene education as well as promoting HIV/AIDS mitigation and prevention activities. The second compoent provides sectoral conditional grants to about 250 communities to improve the water supply and sanitation services. This includes the construction or rehabilitation of existing dug or drilled wells, boreholes equipped with handpumps or powered pumps, spring tapping, piped systems, household latrines, and community sanitation facilities. The third component supports the institutional strengthening and development of a national RWSS program."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":16},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"26,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"JA,BC,BH,WA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Human development","Rural development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,26,78,88,44","mjthemecode":"4,8,10,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":40},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090202005249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090202005249","DocDate":"31-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123591511","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123591511","DocURL":"12-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02030604011942","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02030604011942","DocDate":"21-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00121906041067","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121906041067","DocDate":"30-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01101304015431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01101304015431","DocDate":"31-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01101304015430","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01101304015430","DocDate":"31-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01101304015429","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01101304015429","DocDate":"31-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.4","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01101304015432","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01101304015432","DocDate":"31-MAR-2001"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
