The project consists of three components: 1) rehabilitating the six largest hydropower plants in Macedonia, which represent 91 percent of the country's hydropower capacity; 2) improving the energy management system including modernizing data acquisition and installing remote controls for the power system, completing the dispatch center, and improving telecommunications; and 3) beginning the rehabilitation of the electricity distribution system."},"country_namecode":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of!$!MK","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"MK","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,39,84","mjthemecode":"11,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"006796645_2006082314110745","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006796645_2006082314110745","DocURL":"28-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"006796645_2006082314110745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006796645_2006082314110745","DocDate":"28-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060117114252","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060117114252","DocDate":"21-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200352459","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200352459","DocURL":"20-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200352660","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200352660","DocURL":"20-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980313101652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980313101652","DocDate":"23-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182849","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182849","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060111542636","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060111542636","DocDate":"19-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of"}},"facets":{}}
