Nearly 90 percent of project investment is targeted to help families whose incomes are below Guayaquil's absolute poverty threshold. The project includes three major components: loans and technical assistance to small-scale enterprises, slum upgrading plus sites-and-services development, and loans for housing construction and improvement. Since a multi-sector urban project of this nature has not been implemented before in Ecuador, there is a risk that management problems might occur due to inexperience. However, technical assistance and close supervision have been built into project design to reduce this risk."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"31,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"UM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban management","code":"UM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924222825","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924222825","DocDate":"31-DEC-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924222743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924222743","DocDate":"29-DEC-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e958c8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958c8_1_0","DocDate":"11-DEC-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902335448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902335448","DocDate":"30-NOV-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000356161_20111116024837","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20111116024837","DocDate":"09-NOV-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
