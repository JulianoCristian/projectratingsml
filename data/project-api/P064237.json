Achieving thee objectives will protect the Russian population and economy from uncontrolled epidemics of TB, HIV/AIDS, and other epiemiologically important sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The project supports the development and large-scale implementation of interventions that are based on up-to-date scientific evidence. In that context, the major project inputs will be directed at updating and/or dissemination of strategies, guidelines and protocols; assessment of needs as a basis for effective planning, monitoring, and evaluation; training and on-the-job learning to improve the local capacity for effective implementation; supply of equipment and consumables required to improve the technical quality of diagnostic and therapeutic activities; and close attention to project monitoring and evaluation. These comprise the three major components of the project. Targeted prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs will focus on high risk groups: intravenous drug users (IDUs), prisoners, commercial sex workers, men having sex with men, vulnerable youth, members of the armed forces, health workers, and mobile populations and other vulnerable, at-risk groups."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development","Rule of law","Human development"],"themecode":"67,33,69,93,88","mjthemecode":"8,8,8,3,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000334955_20101221050524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20101221050524","DocDate":"01-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100107231221","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100107231221","DocDate":"23-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201513830","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201513830","DocURL":"12-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201513830","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201513830","DocDate":"12-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03032004004360","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03032004004360","DocDate":"10-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99081905314899","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99081905314899","DocDate":"17-OCT-2002"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
