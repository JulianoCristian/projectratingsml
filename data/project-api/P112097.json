This restructuring paper seeks Regional Vice President (RVP) approval to extend the closing date of the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) grant for the project from March 31, 2011 to March 31, 2013. This first extension is required to provide adequate time to complete the project activities which have been considerably delayed due to factors outside the control of the Government and the project implementing agency. The total project cost was estimated at US$ 15.25 million. The project implementation was divided in two phases with each phase covering a two-year period. The ARTF grant agreement for phase one of the project (US$ 5.5 million) was signed on March 23, 2009 with a grant closing date of March 31, 2011."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Public administration- Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Public administration- Water, sanitation and flood protection"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Procurement Plan,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report","countrycode":"AF","sectorcode":"BW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85","mjthemecode":"11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Public administration- Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"BW"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20131017113516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20131017113516","DocDate":"23-SEP-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081a332c6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081a332c6_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAR-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b08195219b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08195219b_1_0","DocDate":"23-FEB-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b0817c2ea0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0817c2ea0_1_0","DocDate":"02-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000356161_20130115165828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130115165828","DocDate":"01-AUG-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012062702473292","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012062702473292","DocDate":"27-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012012814531613","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012012814531613","DocDate":"28-JAN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011071209305446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011071209305446","DocDate":"12-JUL-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20110331021150","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110331021150","DocDate":"29-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20110307235551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110307235551","DocDate":"07-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20110331020732","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110331020732","DocDate":"28-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011010318025988","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011010318025988","DocDate":"03-JAN-2011"}],"countryname":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan"}},"facets":{}}
