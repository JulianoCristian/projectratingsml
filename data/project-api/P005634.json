It would consist of: (i) rehabilitation of 7 existing oases on about 3,000 ha in the Djerid, Nefzaoua and Gabes areas; (ii) creation of 9 new date palm plantations and date palm/forage plantations on 2,100 ha in the Djerid and Nefzaoua areas; (iii) creation of a date processing facility; and (iv) provision of equipment, facilities and personnel for agriculture services, research and technical assistance (60 man-months). About 5,100 small holders or about 30,600 people, mostly in low-income groups would benefit from the project. In addition, improved income opportunities would be provided to about 1,100 permanent workers and about 114,000 man-days of seasonal work would be created."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924224143","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924224143","DocDate":"30-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000333037_20090128011621","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090128011621","DocDate":"30-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e958f6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958f6_1_0","DocDate":"22-JAN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902341585","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902341585","DocDate":"31-DEC-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912473464","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912473464","DocDate":"31-DEC-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
