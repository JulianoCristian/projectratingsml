The project has the following three components: Component 1) will improve the health status o f the Malawian population by increasing access to quality essential health services. The main mechanism for delivering quality care would be by making the already-defined Essential Health Package (EHP) accessible to all, but especially in the most rural and disadvantaged districts and to the poorest and vulnerable populations. Component 2) will increase the number o f staff available through continuation o f the six-year emergency training plan, a concerted recruitment campaign, financing and then filling current vacancies, the use o f volunteers and contract staff and other stop-gap staffing strategies. Component 3) will improve the effectiveness and efficiency o f both the health system and the referral network to support delivery o f the EHP. It will be divided into two subcomponents: (a) Support for central operations and, (b) Support to district operations. Greater emphasis will be placed on support to operations at district and lower levels."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
