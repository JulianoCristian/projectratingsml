This pilot project is part of a long-term national coastal zone program, designed to subsequently adopt, and broadly replicate through the entire coastal zone. The project components will fully integrate conservation with regional development, and, establish, and strengthen protection of key terrestrial, and marine conservation areas, initiating conservation-oriented community activities in those areas, through a spatial development plan. Best practices will be established for a bio-diversity friendly economic development, while, capacity building, and public awareness will raise key government, and non-government stakeholders responsibility for bio-diversity protection. Institutional arrangements will be developed, and implemented to devolve coastal, and marine resource planning to the provincial, and local levels."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":47},"sector2":{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":8},"sector5":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"5,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Resettlement Plan,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"AZ,JB,EZ,YY,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"45,80,82,57,85","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,7,11,11,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other domestic and international trade","code":"YY"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":47},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":33},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":8},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080813012502","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080813012502","DocDate":"01-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000160016_20051212165939","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051212165939","DocDate":"01-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00081705310272","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081705310272","DocDate":"08-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201132812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201132812","DocDate":"01-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201132812","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201132812","DocURL":"01-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201133013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201133013","DocDate":"01-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00051605321581","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051605321581","DocDate":"28-APR-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
