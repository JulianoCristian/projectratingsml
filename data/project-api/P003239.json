In this way, the project aims to improve health outcomes, particularly in terms of nutritional status, lower fertility, and reduced transmission of HIV. Fulfilling these objectives will contribute to the social sustainability of the adjustment program and strengthen the human resource base necessary for the future growth of Zambia. The credit will be divided into three major components: 1) policy development support, including support for national policy development and operational research to help refine the basic policy framework, and adapt operational strategies to the Zambian context through phased testing of the delivery systems, operations research and studies; 2) investment program support, and incremental recurrent budget support which would support Districts in the implementation of Health Reforms through their service delivery, for both capital investment costs and recurrent costs; and 3) external monitoring and evaluation including support for monitoring progress attained through health reforms, and evaluation through beneficiary assessments, auditing, and quality control."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"56,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,71,57,67,68","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03020604012855","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03020604012855","DocDate":"30-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703540210","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703540210","DocDate":"11-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121234113","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121234113","DocURL":"08-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b435_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b435_1_0","DocDate":"15-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007062816","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007062816","DocDate":"14-OCT-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia"}},"facets":{}}
