The reallocation is necessary to correct inadvertent misclassification of expenditures under 'training and workshops', and 'other operational costs' that were identified during the Bank's recent supervision mission. Some training activities were incorrectly categorized under consultants' services; while some goods (such as printing of reports in the form of hard copies and DVDs) were incorrectly categorized under 'other operational costs.' Therefore, while it may appear as 'cost savings' from these two categories, the reallocation simply represents a reposting of expenditures to correct the misclassification. There will be no new or additional activities financed through this reallocation. The total reallocation amounts to $334,487, which represents 9 percent of the total grant amount ($3.7 million).
