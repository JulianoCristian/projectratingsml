The components will: 1) include land purchases by community associations of poor farmers, funded by loans financed through Federal Government budgetary sources, representing the counterpart funding for the Bank financed project components; 2) include subprojects to be made available to participating communities, eligible for complementary investment financing, and technical assistance (TA), to establish the land settlement, and improve the productivity of the acquired land. Matching grants will be provided to rural community associations to finance small-scale subprojects, identified as priority investments for infrastructure, social, and productive aspects on a demand-driven basis, in accordance to technical, economic, environmental and sustainable standards; 3) finance TA, seminars and training for community associations, to strengthen the effectiveness, and quality of project operations, through capacity building programs for community mobilization, specialized skills, best practices, and public awareness; 4) support project coordination, supervision, and monitoring, and, provide the basis to judge ex-post project impacts, and determine ex ante, possible program extensions."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Primer proyecto de alivio de la pobreza en base a la tierra </ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"202,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"WC,AZ,TA,BC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"79,57,54,83","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,6,7,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":20},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":12},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090813024415","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090813024415","DocDate":"29-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201542146","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201542146","DocURL":"16-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201542347","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201542347","DocURL":"16-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00111405302680","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00111405302680","DocDate":"06-NOV-2000"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
