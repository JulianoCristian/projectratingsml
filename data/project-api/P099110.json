This Earthquake Emergency Recovery Credit (ERC) Project will support emergency recovery efforts over a three year period, to mitigate the negative impact of the earthquake, and restore livelihoods, rebuild houses, purchase critical imports, and strengthen capacity for implementation and hazard risk management. The housing component will support the Government's homeowner-driven housing reconstruction program that was recently launched through: housing grants for reconstruction with new seismic resistant core units, and the restoration of damaged homes to seismically acceptable standards; and, technical assistance and capacity building to support the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA), and provincial and local governments in overall project management, reporting, monitoring and evaluation. The strategy for the livelihood component is geared towards the dual objectives of protecting the most vulnerable households in the short-term, through cash grants, and rejuvenating economic activity by reviving small businesses and replacing assets lost in agriculture and livestock.
