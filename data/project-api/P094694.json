HAMSET II aims to: (1) contain the spread o f HIV/AIDS/STI in vulnerable groups as well as the general population through a focused multi-sectoral approach, with renewed attention to the most vulnerable populations; (2) expand the coverage of directly observed treatment (DOT), improve case detection and treatment outcomes for TB; (3) reduce or at least maintain malaria mortality and morbidity at the current low levels; (4) improve the coverage o f effective Reproductive Health (RH) interventions; and (5) strengthen the overall health system, including human resources for health, to enable the country to better address HAMSET diseases. The project has four components: 1. Multi-Sectoral Response: This component supports key (non-health) line ministries and civil society organizations at both national and zoba level to scale up prevention (especially behavior change communication and stigma reduction), care and support interventions for HIV/AIDS/STI, malaria, TB and reproductive health (RH) (with emphasis on mobilizing communities to utilize health services). 2. Health Sector Response: This has five sub-components: HIV/AIDS/STI TB, malaria, RH, and Human Resources for Health. Each o f the first four sub-components will comprise three activity categories: (a) Human resources for HAMSET diseases: HAMSET II will improve human Improve the information base for decision making; (b) Scale up prevention interventions; and (c) Scale up diagnostic, treatment, care and support services; 3.
