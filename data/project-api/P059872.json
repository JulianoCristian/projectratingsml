The project components will: 1) extend basic education coverage, by supporting continued rehabilitation, and extension of rural, and low-income areas' schools, through the construction of new preschool classrooms in existing basic education schools, as well as the renovation, and extension of schools for children with special needs; 2) improve basic education quality, through continued investments for schools' equipment, which includes computer facilities. The component will further initiate expansion of formal preschool education, and education for children with special needs, and, additionally, non-formal education, and early childhood development will be supported, targeted specifically for deprived households; 3) support in-service training in information, and communications technology (ICT) to teachers to improve basic computer skills, and assist in utilizing ICT to improve instruction, to inspectors to prod pedagogical ICT support to schools, and to assist computer instructors for the full utilization of ICT classroom potential. As the previous components, teachers of children with special needs, early childhood parents, and preschool teachers, will benefit from specifically designed training courses; 4) finance consulting services in the areas of project management, procurement aspects, financial management, including construction issues, equipment supply, and training needs; and, 5) support studies to assess program outcomes, particularly supporting semi-annual reviews."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"BH,BC,EC,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Rural development","Human development","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,66,78,65","mjthemecode":"8,10,8,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":65},{"Name":"Education","Percent":28},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080703030542","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080703030542","DocDate":"29-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201504692","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201504692","DocDate":"26-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201504692","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201504692","DocURL":"26-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0206260400300","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0206260400300","DocDate":"12-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02031404021525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02031404021525","DocDate":"12-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02042304021124","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02042304021124","DocDate":"26-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00110105335413","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00110105335413","DocDate":"26-MAR-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
