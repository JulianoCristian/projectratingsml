The Earthquake Reconstruction Project will complete the reconstruction of housing, factory shells and municipal infrastructure that could provide immediate assistance and employment to the needy population in the earthquake zone. It will also support some key reforms in housing policy ( e.g., privatization, cost recovery, single family self-help housing, etc.) and help develop the overall housing reform agenda for Armenia. Additionally, it will prepare a long-term regional development strategy to rehabilitate the earthquake zone and will provide equipment to the Earthquake Engineering Institute."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Armenia!$!AM","sector1":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":41},"sector2":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"sector5":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"28,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Housing construction"},{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AM","sectorcode":"WZ,BC,JB,YW,YC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"56,52,74,40","mjthemecode":"4,9,6,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":41},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":34},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20040817103629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040817103629","DocDate":"31-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123323319","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123323319","DocURL":"18-FEB-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123323520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123323520","DocDate":"18-FEB-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123323319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123323319","DocDate":"18-FEB-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b321_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b321_1_0","DocDate":"01-FEB-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005003638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005003638","DocDate":"05-JAN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005003308","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005003308","DocDate":"05-JAN-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Armenia"}},"facets":{}}
