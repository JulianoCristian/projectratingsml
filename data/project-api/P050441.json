In addition, related industrial skills will be enhanced, and a systematic tracking program will be instituted to analyze common criteria initiatives. Within the strategic context, the project will contribute widely to broad-based growth and poverty reduction, through the expansion of financial inter-mediation to small-scale rural and urban clients. The project components will include: 1) formulation and approval of a national micro-finance policy, to endorse international best practices, and direct the Government's activity in the sector, diffusing inappropriate political interference; 2) design of legal, regulatory, and, supervisory frameworks, focusing on institutional strengthening. Recommendations for revisions in the law and regulations will be developed, for final review by stakeholders; 3) preparation of operational guidelines, covering: banking; cooperative financial institutions; non-governmental organizations; and, capacity building initiatives; 4) institutional strengthening of the Bank of Tanzania, to improve coordination, monitoring/evaluation of micro-finance activities, and develop its Cooperative Department; and, 5) technical workshops/conferences, to enhance micro-finance knowledge and skills."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":39},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"2,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"FE,FA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"41,34,75","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":39},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050712122539","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050712122539","DocDate":"30-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201092639","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201092639","DocURL":"26-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9908260530597","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9908260530597","DocDate":"04-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173352","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173352","DocDate":"15-MAY-1998"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
