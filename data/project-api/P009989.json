In order to achieve the above goals, the project will have three major objectives : 1) capacity expansion which would expand and diversify programs in about 50% of the Polytechnic system ( including improving training opportunities for women, rural populations and the handicapped ); 2) quality improvement ( modernizing the equipment and facilities of Polytechnics, expanding teacher training, and development of career development system for teaching staff ); and 3) efficiency improvement which will strengthen the Bureau of Technical Education, granting academic autonomy to selected Polytechnics."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":42},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national
