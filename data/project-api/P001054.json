It seeks to help (a) develop planning and management capabilities within the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MSAS) and introduce policy and administrative reforms to improve the quality and efficiency of basic health services; (b) improve basic health care and strengthen financial and operational management of health services; and (c) develop, introduce and evaluate cost recovery mechanisms. To that end, the project includes a health sector management component at the national level and a regional health services component for Middle Guinea. At the National level, the project will improve the capacity of MSAS in planning, management, and staff training. It will also strengthen central level MSAS capability in the key technical areas of maternal and child health, family planning, nutrition, and health education. At the regional level, the project will improve the quality of priority health services in five prefectures in the region of Middle Guinea. To accomplish these tasks, the project will provide technical assistance, training, equipment, materials, drugs, civil works, and finance incremental non-salary operating costs on a declining basis."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other population, health and nutrition","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"19,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other population, health and nutrition"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"HY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other population, health and nutrition","code":"HY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214170453","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214170453","DocDate":"17-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120305902","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120305902","DocURL":"16-NOV-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120305902","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120305902","DocDate":"16-NOV-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36c88_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36c88_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926063321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926063321","DocDate":"29-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
