The components will: 1) support the Government in implementing its decentralization policy, by improving fiscal decentralization, building capacity at provincial, district, and sub-district levels, as well as improving planning and financial management, organizational restructuring, and systems development. Activities include the application of new resource allocation criteria, based on an objective, transparent, poverty-focused rationale; recurrent budgets, simplified to allow increased discretionary control in resource allocation; and, capacity building, to focus on financial management training for District Health, Hospital and Rural Management Boards; 2) focus on the medical aspects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, to also include preventive medicine, based on behavior interventions, contraceptive uses, blood testing, etc, with special attention to the poor, adolescent, and women; and, 3) address reproductive health, on such issues as family planning, safe motherhood, child survival, and sexually transmitted infections. Training, and procurement of drugs, and equipment will be financed."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Public Expenditure Review","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"BH,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Public sector governance","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"69,26,88,59,63","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,7,8,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080718003814","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080718003814","DocDate":"13-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000090341_20050614112727","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050614112727","DocDate":"13-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.2","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20050615161354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050615161354","DocDate":"20-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20050615161131","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050615161131","DocDate":"20-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201172068","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201172068","DocURL":"07-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201172068","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201172068","DocDate":"07-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00112305412221","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112305412221","DocDate":"16-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00061505322832","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00061505322832","DocDate":"02-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Public Expenditure Review (PERR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PERR","EntityID":"000386194_20120509032103","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120509032103","DocDate":"10-JUN-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
