To that end, the project consists of the following components: (a) road upgrading of three sections of main roads and seven sections of secondary roads which are narrow gravel roads in badly deteriorating conditions and carrying considerable traffic.  These roads would be upgraded to bituminous paved two-lane standard on properly engineered alignments with adequate drainage; (b) with corresponding road construction equipment required to help the Public Works Department (PWD) to upgrade road sections to be carried out by force account.  In addition, the project involves (c) consultancy services to assist PWD in revising the detailed engineering for the road works, undertaking construction supervision of these works and preparing detailed engineering for two major bridges in need of reconstruction.  This component also includes technical assistance services to assist PWD to implement and monitor the force account road works, and strengthen its organization for planning, programming, implementing and cost monitoring of road maintenance operations."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Fiji!$!FJ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"23,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"FJ","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926104740","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926104740","DocDate":"30-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032915023527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032915023527","DocDate":"07-JAN-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Fiji"}},"facets":{}}
