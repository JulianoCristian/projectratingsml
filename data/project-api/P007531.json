In its first stage, to which the Bank loan will apply, the works will have an annual production capacity of 1.1 million tons of crude steel equalling 1 million tons of light nonflat finished steel products. The works are located near iron ore reserves sufficient for at least 30 years of production at Stage I level. Coal supplies will be imported through an adjacent deep-water port. The new works will include mining equipment and a concentration plant, a concentrate pipeline, a pelletizing plant, a coke oven plant, a blast furnace plant, a basic oxygen steelmaking plant, a continuous casting plant, a rod and bar mill, a bar and light section mill, a power plant, water supply and treatment equipment, an air compressor station, an oxygen plant, and engineering workshops.
