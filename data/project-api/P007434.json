The Third Export Development Fund Project will provide foreign exchange and credit to exporters of nontraditional manufactured and agricultural products and to qualified domestic enterprises producing inputs for the export producers. Part of the loan funds will be used to provide short-term financing for imported raw materials, intermediate goods, packaging material and spare parts. Other loan funds will be available to provide medium-term credits for financing equipment replacement and permanent working capital needs. In addition, the loan will be used to meet the technical assistance needs of EDF and to finance export promotion and technical assistance requirements of Jamaican exporters.
