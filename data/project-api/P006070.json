The project is composed of four components. First an institutional development policy implementation component to improve the labor market information system, expand the apprenticeship system, strengthen the National Training Council, increase cost recovery, and establish a graduate tracing system. Second, the project will finance a skills training component to develop a broad based pre- and in-service training program. The third is a tourism training component to improve coordination and articulation between existing training programs and also to provide civil works and accommodations for trainees.
