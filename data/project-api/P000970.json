There are two main components. The first finances feasibility studies of a railway corridor and marshaling yard, and detailed engineering, construction, and supervision of the off-site infrastructure for the Tema export-processing zone, including constructing access roads, side drainage, and associated works; constructs water supply systems, wastewater disposable systems, and off-site drainage systems; supplies and installs electrical power and transformers; builds a container devanning area outside of the port and improves port container and airport cargo facilities; and implements the environmental management plan. The second component promotes investment and removes administrative bottlenecks to facilitate trade. It builds capacity by changing operational procedures, human resources, and international standards compliance in customs, excise, and preventive services; increasing private participation in the ports and harbor authority; converting the civil aviation authority into a regulatory agency and operationalizing open skies; modernizing immigration services regulations and operating procedure; providing country and investment support to the investment promotion center; funding expertise, equipment, training, and operational support to the free zones board; and manages the Gateway program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":39},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":19},"sector4":{"Name":"Power","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"50,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Board Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"YY,LD,TZ,BC,WZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,39,45,49","mjthemecode":"5,5,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Other domestic and international trade","code":"YY"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":39},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":32},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":19},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":5},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000461832_20140110121748","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000461832_20140110121748","DocDate":"11-DEC-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20100824002746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100824002746","DocDate":"30-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333038_20100705014100","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100705014100","DocDate":"01-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000090341_20051114092956","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20051114092956","DocDate":"11-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121320446","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121320446","DocURL":"07-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121320446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121320446","DocDate":"07-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980709144444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980709144444","DocDate":"05-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184923","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
