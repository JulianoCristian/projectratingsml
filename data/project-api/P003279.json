The project will also strengthen the Small Enterprises Development Corporation (SEDCO). Specifically, the project will: (i) provide a line of credit to SEDCO for on-lending to an estimated 470 SSEs; and (ii) provide technical assistance. The technical assistance will improve the institutional efficiency of SEDCO, help finance a management training program for small contractors and finance a study of the construction sector and its potential for small construction firms. The project will play a critical role in strengthening the Government program to provide an effective integrated package of technical and financial support to small-scale entrepreneurs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zimbabwe!$!ZW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ZW","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961029214040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029214040","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702140311","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702140311","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zimbabwe"}},"facets":{}}
