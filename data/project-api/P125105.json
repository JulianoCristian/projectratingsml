Pursuant to a request from the authorized representative of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan ('Recipient') dated December 24, 2012, this Restructuring Paper seeks a request for a reallocation of funds in the amount of 3,610,000 SDR from Category (2) to Category (3) for the subject IDA Credit, the Pakistan Flood Emergency Cash Transfer Project. The proposed reallocation is necessary to allow NADRA to support continued field operations required for the resolution of grievances and completion of project activities. The team supports this reallocation. As per paragraph 8 of the Minutes of Negotiations, \"in case of a shortfall in the funds required by NADRA to carryout component 2 of the Project, the Recipient will exchange communication with the World Bank to either re-allocate funds from Categories 1 or 2 to Category 3, or secure the requisite funds from its own resources.\" In a letter dated December 24th, 2012, the Government of Pakistan requested such a reallocation. As per the MOU with Development Partners, the financing gap for cash grants to flood affected households is to be covered by the Government of Pakistan."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of
