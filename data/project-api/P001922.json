The Sugar Energy Development Project consists of three main components:  (a) development and adaptation of technologies for biomass energy production; (b) training of technical staff of bagasse-and-coal plants; and (c) support for BEDP management and coordination, including environmental monitoring.  The GET will fund the total cost of the project, involving expenditures for the equipment and vehicles, short term training courses and study visits, and expenditures for an international workshop."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mauritius!$!MU","sector1":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Renewable energy"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,GEF Project Document","countrycode":"MU","sectorcode":"LE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,84","mjthemecode":"11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121392685","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121392685","DocURL":"01-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002032552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002032552","DocDate":"05-MAR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"GEF Project Document (PD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PD","EntityID":"000009265_3961219141648","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219141648","DocDate":"29-FEB-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mauritius"}},"facets":{}}
