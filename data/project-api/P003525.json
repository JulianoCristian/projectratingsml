The project allows coastal dwellers to switch to culture fisheries from the over-exploited offshore fishing industry and to supplement their earnings with livestock and horticultural activities.  The project aims to (a) develop mariculture by constructing or improving about 10,100 ha of ponds for shrimp, eels and laver (edible seaweed); (b) support animal husbandry by providing breeding stock and on-farm improvements; (c) promote agriculture by establishing fruit and nut production bases; and (d) further the adoption of technological advances by constructing pilot plants to test new approaches in various fields of production and processing.  The project includes support facilities, such as feed mills, cold stores, processing plants and training centers and local and overseas training for technical and managerial staff and farmers."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
