It would develop Lesotho's water resources; strengthen sector institutions; and upgrade domestic water supplies. The project would, by 1986, provide public water service to some 20,000 new consumers who now rely on unprotected sources and would improve reliability and quality of water now supplied to about 21,000 current consumers. In addition, the Project would strengthen a key Government institution, the Water and Sewerage Branch (WSB) of the Ministry of Works (MW)."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Lesotho!$!LS","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Agreement","countrycode":"LS","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924180341","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924180341","DocDate":"23-NOV-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902321840","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902321840","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912420425","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912420425","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c5a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c5a_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAR-1979"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Lesotho"}},"facets":{}}
