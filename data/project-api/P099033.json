The global crisis is affecting negatively Burkina's growth, threatens the outturn of the coming cotton campaign and risks to reverse the progress the country has made in poverty reduction  It is in this challenging context that the operation aims to support a core set of critical actions to: (i) improve the investment climate and promote exports, with a particular focus on actions to save the coming cotton campaign and carry out longer-term reforms to improve the sector's overall competitiveness; (ii) protect access to quality basic services through deepened decentralization; and (iii) maximize the effectiveness of limited fiscal resources available by promoting efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources through enhanced public financial management. The Ninth Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSG-9) will also support export diversification beyond cotton by facilitating trade and small and medium-enterprise investment. In addition, PRSG-9 will support efforts to protect access to quality basic services by further transferring responsibilities and resources to urban municipalities in the education sector and to rural municipalities in the water and sanitation sector, while supporting economic activities and services in urban municipalities. Lastly, PRSG-9 will help increase public spending effectiveness by improving budget transparency, oversight and accountability, including through support for the establishment of the High Authority for State Oversight (ASCE)."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BF","sectorcode":"EP,WZ,BH,AZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"26,29,27,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":35},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2009122316465025","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009122316465025","DocURL":"29-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2009122316465025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009122316465025","DocDate":"29-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20090616232806","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090616232806","DocDate":"10-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090602103559","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090602103559","DocDate":"29-MAY-2009"}],"countryname":"Burkina Faso","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
