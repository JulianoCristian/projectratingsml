In the health sector, the project supports a comprehensive program to control malaria, the provision of essential drugs, and the strengthening of health planning. In the education sector, the project comprises the purchase of school textbooks and educational materials, the strengthening of school inspection at the primary school level, and the improvement in education planning. In both sectors, the main institutional reform goals are to improve efficiency in service delivery and utilization of existing resources as well as mobilization of additional resources. These goals are to be achieved through the improvements in planning, management information, external assistance coordination as well as through the cost recovery program from the distribution of essential drugs and school textbooks. The project includes a limited number of studies in very high priority areas, such as nutrition, family planning and community involvement. The studies are aimed at improving the understanding of the issues and constraints, and recommending suitable interventions."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Prin!$!ST","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":83},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":1},"sector4":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"11,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ST","sectorcode":"ES,EP,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"themecode":"67,55,65","mjthemecode":"8,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":83},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":1},{"Name":"Education","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02011504020061","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02011504020061","DocDate":"20-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121083053","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121083053","DocURL":"06-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121083053","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121083053","DocDate":"06-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e39481_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e39481_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002064118","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002064118","DocDate":"20-FEB-1992"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Prin"}},"facets":{}}
