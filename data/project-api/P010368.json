The project will assist the newly created Janasaviya Trust Fund (the Trust). The Trust will manage four funds: (a) a Credit Fund to lend to partner organizations (POs) which will on-lend to the poor in a manner prescribed by the trust at interest rates which will make the credit fund operations self-supporting: (b) a Human Resources Development Fund for promoting the productive use of credit and for developing the lending capacity of POs; (c) a Rural Works Fund for building economically viable infrastructure and creating wage employment; and (d) a Nutrition Fund for reducing the proportion of wasting and stunting in children and reducing the incidence of low birth weight and the prevalence of maternal malnutrition. In addition, the project will support an Employment and Poverty Policy Unit in the Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":47},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":9},"sector5":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"57,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"WZ,TA,AI,JB,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"76,77,53,63,41","mjthemecode":"4,8,6,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":47},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":26},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":9},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":9},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123275031","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123275031","DocDate":"08-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123275232","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123275232","DocURL":"08-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123275031","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123275031","DocURL":"08-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123275232","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123275232","DocDate":"08-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e3719b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3719b_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e3719a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3719a_1_0","DocDate":"25-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930094454","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930094454","DocDate":"03-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960930095004","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930095004","DocDate":"03-APR-1991"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
