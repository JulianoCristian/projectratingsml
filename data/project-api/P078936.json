The two key outcome indicators for the project development objective are: (i) incremental irrigated area resulting from rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure; and (ii) increase in crop yields. Monitoring data show that as of October 31, 2010, the incremental irrigated area achieved was over 138,000 hectares compared to the end-of project target of 145,000 hectares. The latest annual crop survey carried out in 2010 also shows substantial increases (ranging from 21 percent to 86 percent) in crop yields as compared to the control group. Another significant outcome of irrigation rehabilitation is that water related disputes have reduced by 50 percent to 95 percent in rehabilitated schemes. The total number of project beneficiaries now exceeds 600,000 people. The project closing date was extended by one year when the first additional financing was approved, and by a further two and a half years when the second additional financing was approved, resulting in a cumulative extension of three and a half years. The current closing date is March 31, 2011."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"General water,
