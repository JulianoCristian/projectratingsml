The changes are intended to revise the end-of-project target for the 'off-grid renewable' component from 161,000 households, small and medium enterprises and public institutions being connected to 113,500 as recommended by the ministry of power and energy. The reduced target is appropriate in light of faster than anticipated grid-based rural electrification which reduces demand for off-grid renewable solutions. The original target was 100,000 households and 1,000 small and medium enterprises and public institutions to be connected under the project through off-grid systems such as solar photovoltaic investments as well community-based village hydro and bio-mass schemes. The additional financing set an additional target of 60,000 households (including 500 small and medium enterprises) to be connected through off-grid systems."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist
