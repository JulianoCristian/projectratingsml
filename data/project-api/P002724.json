Specifically, the project would finance a training program for TRDB's staff and for village officials; provision of consultants and local staff to strengthen TRDB's organizational structure; provision of new office facilities, office equipment and furniture; provision of transportation facilities; an input distribution study; and a line of credit to support TRDB's lending program. Project benefits would be the increased capacity of TRDB to efficiently meet village requirements of credit which would help in increasing village production and farmers' income. Recovery of the credit is the basic risk under the proposed project. However, seminars for village officials in accounting and credit concepts, improved billing procedures, efficient follow-up and supervision, and providing credit only to those villages with good credit records, should minimize this risk."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924164608","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924164608","DocDate":"28-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd1f0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd1f0_1_0","DocDate":"04-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd1ee_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd1ee_1_0","DocDate":"04-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902342714","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902342714","DocDate":"29-FEB-1980"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
