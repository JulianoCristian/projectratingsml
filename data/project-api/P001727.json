To attain these objectives, the project comprises three components. The health component will increase the coverage and quality of health care: (a) directly through the development of a decentralized, district-based health development program involving the construction/rehabilitation of primary and referral care centers, as well as active community, nongovernmental organizations and private sector participation; and (b) indirectly by improving the planning and management of the sector's personnel, physical and financial resources as well as the provision of essential drugs. The population component will: (a) strengthen the institutions in charge of disseminating/implementing the national population policy and of planning, managing and evaluating family planning (FP) programs; and (b) increase the demand for, availablity and quality of FP services nationwide. The rural water supply component will: (a) increase the supply of safe drinking water for the rural population in the project area; (b) support the government's policy of community participation in the financial and technical management of rural water supply; and (c) implement an iodination program in areas where iodine deficiency is prevalent."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":44},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":27},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":26},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"26,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"BC,JB,WC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Rural development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,78,67,25","mjthemecode":"2,8,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":44},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":27},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":26},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121004279","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121004279","DocURL":"03-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121004279","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121004279","DocDate":"03-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e37161_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e37161_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929085800","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929085800","DocDate":"22-FEB-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000356161_20100820034235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20100820034235","DocDate":"22-FEB-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
