The components will: 1) finance roads rehabilitation, to improve accessibility to rural areas, and restore operating conditions along regional economic corridors. Unpaved primary, and secondary roads will be selected for rehabilitation, to be integrated into the consolidated road network; 2) routine, and periodic maintenance of rural roads, and connecting primary, and secondary roads will be strengthened, based on a co-financing arrangement between the central government, and benefited local governments; 3) improve the non-motorized rural transport, by providing technical assistance for village-level infrastructure management, to include community participation in the planning, and implementation of works; 4) pilot an institutional model for managing the rural road network at the provincial level, whose municipal authorities will jointly assume responsibility over the development of a core provincial road network. This will avoid current institutional, and financial segmentation, that prevents municipalities from undertaking integrated initiatives, or responsibilities; 5) pilot the development of strategic frameworks for improving rural accessibility in the Selva region. The pilot will ascertain technical, institutional, environmental, and economic guidelines to set an inter-modal transportation system along rivers; and, 6) further develop the institutional building program, already underway, to improve rural transport policy, and strategies; to improve planning, and management of rural roads; and, to develop community-based micro-enterprises for road maintenance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and
