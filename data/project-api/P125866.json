This stand-alone development policy operation supports the authorities' efforts to (i) deepen executive accountability, (ii) protect poverty reduction progress made in recent years, and (iii) prepare for a rapid economic recovery as the political transition ends and the security situation improves. While the credit will primarily translate into financing programs from the emergency priority action plan 2013-14, particular attention is given to the policy actions aimed at: (i) strengthening controls on budget and transparency, (ii) protecting pro-poor expenditures, (iii) restoring financial sustainability and investment capacity in power and irrigation sectors, and (iv) improving public financial and investment management. The operation fully shares the objectives of the World Bank Group's interim strategy note for FY14-15, and is aligned with the World Bank's Strategy for Africa. The operation is also part of a larger regional response to the crisis in the Sahel. While Mali is at the epicenter of the crisis, it is broadly understood that some of its causes, and the responses, have to be found at the regional Sahelian level. Thus, development policy operations are also being processed in Niger and Burkina Faso. A World Bank regional response, taking the form of projects to strengthen resilience and promote regional integration, while building knowledge on demographic and spatial Sahelian challenges was also in the making by May 2013."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":13},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":44},"theme2":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":6},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":18},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Statutory Committee Report,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"LT,JB,YZ,AZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,55,28,27","mjthemecode":"2,2,6,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":13},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":13},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":12},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20140724103902","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20140724103902","DocDate":"25-JUN-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b08219055d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08219055d_1_0","DocDate":"31-DEC-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"090224b08204a1d9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08204a1d9_1_0","DocDate":"18-SEP-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Statutory Committee Report (SCR),  Vol.","DocType":"SCR","EntityID":"090224b08204a5d0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08204a5d0_1_0","DocDate":"06-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20130531104546","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130531104546","DocDate":"20-MAY-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20111025112926","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20111025112926","DocDate":"19-OCT-2011"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
