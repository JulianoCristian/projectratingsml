The project would also provide necessary information for further development of the storage, processing and distribution sub-sector and for future Government foodgrain marketing and price policy formulation. The project would consist of: (i) construction of 40,000 MT of bagged grain storage warehouses comprising 37,000 MT storage capacity at eight procurement centers in the Terai and a 3,000 MT transshipment storage facility at Hetauda; (ii) technical assistance for NFC in management and organization, and in finance and accounting, and for NFC and RECs in grain quality control and godown maintenance; (iii) training and study tours for NFC and RECs managers; and (iv) studies on future needs for foodgrain storage and processing facilities and on foodgrain marketing and price policy. The project faces no special risks."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"6,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NP","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925050110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925050110","DocDate":"29-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925050020","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925050020","DocDate":"25-OCT-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902360491","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902360491","DocDate":"31-AUG-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04236_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04236_1_0","DocDate":"26-AUG-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04234_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04234_1_0","DocDate":"26-AUG-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912490431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912490431","DocDate":"31-JUL-1980"}],"countryname":"Nepal"}},"facets":{}}
