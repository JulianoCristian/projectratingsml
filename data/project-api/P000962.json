To achieve this, the project will strengthen the capacity of the Department of Fisheries (DOF) of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) for managing the sub-sector focusing on: formulation of policy and management plans and their implementation: monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement; and the promotion of the development of inland fisheries. This will require strengthening of the DOF through reorganization and staff training; stock assessment, and preparation and implementation of management plans for the marine and inland fisheries; improvement of extension and aquaculture including the use of improved quality fingerlings; establishment of a Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance (MCS) system for marine and inland fisheries; and reform of the policy, legal and regulatory framework in the sub-sector to improve management, enhance private investment, and promote sustainable catches of fish."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":33},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Animal production"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"AJ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,85,33,82","mjthemecode":"11,3,11,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":67},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":33}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030703090315","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030703090315","DocDate":"27-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121254944","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121254944","DocURL":"25-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121254944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121254944","DocDate":"25-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23bd3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23bd3_1_0","DocDate":"02-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214184450","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214184450","DocDate":"21-MAR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
