The project has three components. First, the expansion of in-situ conservation will include the installation of Medicinal Plant Conservation Areas (MPCAs) in five areas where there is active collection from the wild. Second, the expansion of ex-situ cultivation and conservation will improve existing nurseries, establish two new nurseries, research propagation, support home garden and plantation research, and disseminate research results. Third, the information and institutional support will promote an appropriate legal and policy environment through studies and recommendations for regulations; establishment of information network on medicinal plants; training; monitoring and evaluation; and support for project management, coordination, and advisory functions."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":46},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"4,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"BG,JB,AT,BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,80,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":46},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":17},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20041217110244","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041217110244","DocDate":"15-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052714512867","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052714512867","DocDate":"15-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980203115318","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980203115318","DocDate":"06-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01041101453040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01041101453040","DocDate":"24-OCT-1997"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
