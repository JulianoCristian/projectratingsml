The series has been designed to support the Government of Bulgaria (GOB) to meet some of the challenges associated with European Union (EU) accession in the case of DPL I and post-accession - DPL II and III. The DPL series is supporting the adoption and implementation of policies to (i) increase employment and lay the foundations for long-term productivity growth by providing incentives for job creation and improving quality of education; and (ii) promote fiscal sustainability through efficiency gains in social sectors. Many of the policies are well placed to improve access to and quality of social services in the medium term, a secondary objective of the program. The actions supported by the DPL series are expected to contribute in the medium term to increased speed of convergence with EU policies and standards, enhanced competitiveness through increased skills of the labor force and better investment climate, more efficient health, education, and social assistance systems, and a more equitable access to basic social services. The focus of this DPL series reflects the Government's social sectors and productivity agenda and its strategic use of multilateral organizations support to implement reforms and improve outcomes in sectors that remain outside the sphere of intervention of the EU."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BG","sectorcode":"BK,JA,JB,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Human development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"67,65,51","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20101220011559","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20101220011559","DocDate":"27-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2009061014364228","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009061014364228","DocURL":"18-NOV-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20081016001707","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20081016001707","DocDate":"06-OCT-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20080220133946","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080220133946","DocDate":"03-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20071011110728","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20071011110728","DocDate":"06-SEP-2007"}],"countryname":"Republic of Bulgaria","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
