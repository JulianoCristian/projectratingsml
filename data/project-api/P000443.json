The proposed project consists of the reconstruction of the Bangui-Bossembele road to two-lane bituminous sealed standard including the construction of a two-lane bridge over the M'Bali River. The benefits for C.A.E. will mainly consist of savings in vehicle operating costs, maintenance costs and distance savings. The project will also stimulate agricultural development in some populated areas by providing improved access to markets and reduced costs of supplying inputs. On the external side, the project is not only an important route for import/export traffic via Cameroon, but also a part of the Trans-African highway and of the Trans-Equatorial route serving land-locked Chad. The project therefore contributes also to the economic development of the Central African Region."},"country_namecode":"Central African Republic!$!CF","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CF","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102114","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102114","DocDate":"16-APR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04256_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04256_1_0","DocDate":"05-SEP-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c2d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c2d_1_0","DocDate":"05-SEP-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000094946_99112505314552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99112505314552","DocDate":"22-AUG-1978"}],"countryname":"Central African Republic"}},"facets":{}}
