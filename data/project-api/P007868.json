The project also includes technical assistance for the components and for undertaking an agricultural census, including the establishment of a permanent system for gathering agricultural statistics. The realization of the project's benefits will depend on the successful implementation of technical assistance at all levels. For the livestock component, there is the risk that unusually drastic reduction of beef prices may deter ranchers from seeking investment credit at the levels assumed under the project. The settlement development component also depends on the timely provision of rural roads."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Paraguay!$!PY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"PY","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925090233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925090233","DocDate":"23-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000333038_20090202014756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090202014756","DocDate":"23-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925071146","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925071146","DocDate":"02-APR-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902322862","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902322862","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100215232319","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100215232319","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912423161","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912423161","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e452_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e452_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e451_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e451_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e450_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e450_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e44f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e44f_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAR-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Paraguay"}},"facets":{}}
