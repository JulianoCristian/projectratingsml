However, there are significant risk categories for this project, namely, the potential deterioration within the political and security context, the limited implementation capacity, the non-payment issue of teachers' salaries, in addition to the likely inability to disburse (or misuse) project funds. It is foreseen that the benefits of the project, and its appropriate design, should mitigate those risks."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Adult
