The project consists of three components. The first component focuses on capacity building, institutional development, and computerization. In this component, system-level planning and coordination are targeted on the central agencies responsible for higher education. Institutional-level planning improvements are targeted to universities and other higher education institutions. The component will also support development of information technology in participating universities and higher education institutions. The second component will provide grants, on a competitive basis, to support quality improvements in selected qualifying higher education institutions and universities. The selected improvement programs will focus on teaching, learning, research, and institutional administration. The third component provides the essential coordination, implementation, procurement, contract management and accounting functions needed for project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"83,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"51,61,66","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080703022628","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080703022628","DocDate":"21-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122113880","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122113880","DocURL":"08-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122113880","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122113880","DocDate":"08-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703540411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703540411","DocDate":"07-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980928162354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980928162354","DocDate":"28-JUL-1998"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
