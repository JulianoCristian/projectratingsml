The project would establish 22,600 ha of state-owned commercial Gmelina plantations in Ondo and Ogun States and 1,600 ha of pine and eucalyptus trials in Anambra State, and strenghthen the state and federal forestry services. It would cover five years of a long-term plantation development program, and would increase roundwood production for utility grade timber; provide short-fiber pulpwood for the pulp and paper industry; assess the viability of supplying locally-grown long-fiber pulpwood to the pulp and paper industry; improve forest plantation management and planning; improve the living and working conditions for approximately 1,500 forestry workers and their families, and increase food production in the rural areas."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"31,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924212133","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924212133","DocDate":"19-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912411859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912411859","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902323167","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902323167","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e466_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e466_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e464_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e464_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e463_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e463_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e461_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e461_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e976ad_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976ad_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e976ac_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976ac_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1979"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
