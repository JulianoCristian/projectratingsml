In support of this objective, the Ministry of Education and Youth's (MOEY) ability to plan and efficiently manage a rapidly expanding school system will have to be improved. This will be accomplished by developing such key education services in MOEY as planning, management and curriculum development. Attention will also focus on training and upgrading teacher qualifications, and improving access to education for children in rural areas, particularly girls. These mentioned objectives will be addressed by: 1) establishing technical assistance support; 2) constructing and equipping three teacher training colleges; and, 3) supporting the construction of 30 primary schools and 5 secondary schools."},"country_namecode":"Sultanate of Oman!$!OM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"13,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"OM","sectorcode":"EY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other education","code":"EY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019162930","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019162930","DocDate":"31-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122142934","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122142934","DocURL":"17-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122142934","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122142934","DocDate":"17-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926071804","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926071804","DocDate":"30-MAR-1987"}],"countryname":"Sultanate of Oman"}},"facets":{}}
