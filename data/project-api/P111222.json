The First Development Policy Grant (DPG1) provided US$15 million in budget support in FY06 to help the RGoB meet selected development goals, and contributed to deepening the policy dialogue. Based on continued good progress on the medium-term reform program, a Second Development Policy Grant (DPG2) for US$12 million was approved in May 2007, and was linked to strengthening the reform program and quickening the pace of implementation. Both operations have closed, and have satisfactorily achieved their development objectives. Section two of this paper summarizes the recent economic, social, and political developments in Bhutan. Section three describes the key elements of the RGoB's overarching reform agenda and its distinctive development vision, anchored in the tenth five year plan, which are highlighted in its own program in a medium-term framework. Section four discusses the Bank's engagement in Bhutan. Section five presents the specific components of Bhutan's policy and institutional reforms that constitute critical actions for the Development Policy Financing for Institutional Strengthening (DPFIS). Section six outlines implementation arrangements."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Bhutan!$!BT","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":44},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":14},"sector3":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Credit Reporting and Secured Transactions","Percent":14},"sector5":{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":18},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":18},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":18},"theme5":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":18},"totalcommamt":"20,220,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Credit Reporting and Secured Transactions"},{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BT","sectorcode":"TI,FR,EV,JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Human development","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"29,40,66,27,39","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,8,4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Credit Reporting and Secured Transactions","code":"FR"},{"name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways","code":"TI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":44},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":14},{"Name":"Education","Percent":14},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":14},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010083110175024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010083110175024","DocDate":"31-AUG-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20101212234555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20101212234555","DocDate":"20-AUG-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010060411053036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010060411053036","DocDate":"12-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20090506014447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090506014447","DocDate":"30-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090210154941","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090210154941","DocDate":"04-FEB-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20081112104848","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20081112104848","DocDate":"21-OCT-2008"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Bhutan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
