The project's components are three. The first, Court Management, reviews the organization and court and case management of the seventeen model courts. It has two subcomponents. The first develops administration policies and strategies between the different levels of the judiciary; finalizes the court management plan and prepares studies; and designs case management procedures incorporating operational standards and statistics which verify and control changes being implemented. The second subcomponent develops a permanent solution to reduce the number of pending cases within the selected courts. The second component improves the skill levels within the court system for both judges and court personnel in court administration and case management by developing an education policy and training judges and court personnel. The third component comprises outreach activities and a number of reviews to evaluate the results of the model courts by creating judicial information centers, conducting user opinion surveys, disseminating information to the public, and evaluating the project."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Access to law and justice","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Legal services","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"BG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Rule of law","Rule of law"],"themecode":"35,31,32","mjthemecode":"3,3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Access to law and justice","code":"31"},{"name":"Legal services","code":"35"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20060724121459","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060724121459","DocDate":"15-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201393818","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201393818","DocURL":"20-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201393919","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201393919","DocURL":"20-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201393919","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201393919","DocDate":"20-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201393818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201393818","DocDate":"20-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980429111322","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429111322","DocDate":"04-MAR-1998"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
