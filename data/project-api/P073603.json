There are 4 components to the project: 1) The capacity building and policy development will aim at strengthening Djibouti's capacity to cope with the spread of HIV/AIDS, and to control malaria and tuberculosis. 2) The Ministry of Health (MOH) and more broadly the health community have special responsibilities for the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS/STIs, malaria, and other opportunistic infections - including malaria, and tuberculosis. 3) As demonstrated in other countries, in order for the control of HIV/AIDS to be effective, it is necessary to have a multisectoral approach to better target priority vulnerable groups. The preparation process of the National Strategic Plan has demonstrated that the MOH could not by itself deliver all the essential prevention, and impact. 4) In order to enlist communities in controlling HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, and to provide them with the means to mitigate the impact of these diseases, it is necessary to provide resources at the local level."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Djibouti!$!DJ","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Malaria","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"DJ","sectorcode":"BC,JA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,88,92,57,61","mjthemecode":"7,7,8,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Malaria","code":"92"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":60},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20091021020813","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20091021020813","DocDate":"29-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052111175680","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052111175680","DocDate":"25-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201372022","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201372022","DocDate":"25-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000112742_20030520150646","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20030520150646","DocDate":"30-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20030528145933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030528145933","DocDate":"30-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0304150403448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0304150403448","DocDate":"07-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03040904022716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03040904022716","DocDate":"31-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_03032504061030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03032504061030","DocDate":"28-FEB-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Djibouti"}},"facets":{}}
