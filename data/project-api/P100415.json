The changes are: (a) to reallocate the funds originally allocated to the Poultry Compensation Funds (PCF), i.e. SDR200, 000 per entity, for the purposes of influenza prevention, preparedness, and planning. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) has requested to reallocate the funds to purchase respirators for intensive care units (ICU), and the Republika Srpska to improve animal disease tracking systems, and purchase personal protection equipment and seasonal vaccines; and (b) to extend the closing date by six months, to provide additional time to carry out civil works for the Sarajevo Veterinary Faculty Avian Influenza National Reference Laboratory (Stup) and the Sarajevo Hospital's Kosevo Clinical Center Viral Laboratory (Kosevo). This will be the first extension of the closing date."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration
