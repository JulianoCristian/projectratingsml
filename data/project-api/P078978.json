The development objective of the CBHP is to increase access to, utilization of, and patient satisfaction with health services in project-supported areas, and to build capacity and efficiency at national and selected oblast and rayon levels in administering the basic package of health benefits (BBP) and per capita financing for primary health care (PHC).  In 2007, food price inflation was 27.5 percent. Within the food basket, the price of bread rose by 49.6 percent in 2007, reflecting the rapid global rise in wheat prices. Such a large increase in the price of bread will affect the living standards of the poor, because it comprises a large share of their consumption basket. Improving the health of the population is a core objective of the Tajikistan Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Similarly, improvement in sector performance and health status are key objectives of the government's reform program and efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The current food crisis is threatening to aggravate these health outcomes particularly among low-income groups, who have little funds available to pay for food and other pressing needs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government
