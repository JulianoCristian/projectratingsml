The major changes in this paper are: (i) changes in the project's development objectives and results monitoring framework by reducing the scope of the Project Development Objective (PDO) and streamlining the number of key performance indicators used in the project; (ii) change in project components and re-allocation of credit proceeds across components to ensure efficient utilization of project resources and to reflect the changing priorities of government; (iii) changes in implementation arrangements to adapt the project to the new institutional structures created by the government; (iv) alignment with the new country financing parameters; (v) transiting to new procurement guidelines for International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loans and International Development Association (IDA) credits published in May 2004 and revised on October 1, 2006; and (vi) extension of project closing date for two years from December 31, 2009 to December 31,
