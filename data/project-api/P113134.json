Madagascar is facing a very challenging situation created by the combined impacts of the food price crisis, the oil price shock, and a devastating cyclone season. While rice represents one third of the consumption basket among Madagascar's poorest households, its domestic price has been steadily increasing and is expected to further substantially increase during the last quarter of 2008 as domestic prices align with international prices between harvest seasons. Oil prices increased, and while prices have lately declined, it will take some time before this decline trickles down to end users. Specifically, the Project will finance: (i) a cash-for-work program to increase access to short-term employment in targeted food-insecure areas; (ii) community-based infrastructure sub-projects to increase access to social and economic services among participating communities; (iii) restored access to social and economic services in the aftermath of catastrophic events; and (iv) project management, monitoring and evaluation, and audit."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Madagascar : Projet de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alimentaire et de reconstruction d\u2019urgence</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Les objectifs de d\u00e9veloppement du Projet d\u2019urgence pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alimentaire et la reconstruction \u00e0 Madagascar sont les suivants : i) assurer un meilleur acc\u00e8s aux emplois \u00e0 court terme dans les r\u00e9gions o\u00f9 s\u00e9vit l\u2019ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 alimentaire ; et ii) r\u00e9tablir l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services sociaux et \u00e9conomiques, \u00e0 la suite des catastrophes naturelles survenues dans des communaut\u00e9s cibl\u00e9es. Madagascar est dans une situation tr\u00e8s difficile cr\u00e9\u00e9e par les effets combin\u00e9s de la crise des prix des produits alimentaires, du choc p\u00e9trolier et d\u2019une saison ayant connu des cyclones d\u00e9vastateurs. Bien que le riz repr\u00e9sente le tiers du panier de consommation dans les m\u00e9nages les plus d\u00e9munis, son prix sur le march\u00e9 national n\u2019a cess\u00e9 de grimper et doit encore sensiblement augmenter au cours du dernier trimestre de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2008, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les prix int\u00e9rieurs s\u2019alignent sur les cours mondiaux entre les saisons de r\u00e9colte. Les cours du p\u00e9trole ont augment\u00e9, et bien que les prix aient r\u00e9cemment baiss\u00e9, il faudra un certain temps pour que cette baisse se fasse sentir au niveau des consommateurs finaux. Le projet doit financer en particulier : i) un programme de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration en esp\u00e8ces du travail permettant un meilleur acc\u00e8s aux emplois \u00e0 court terme dans des zones
