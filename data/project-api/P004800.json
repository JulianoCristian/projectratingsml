The project will finance the following components over a period of about four years: 1) civil works sub-projects for capacity increases involving the widening to four lanes and rehabilitation of the existing two lanes of selected sections of the country's major inter-urban national highways; 2) consulting services for the design and supervision of the Department of Highways' (DOH) road widening program; 3) technical assistance and training to the Land Transport Department, the Department of Pollution Control, DOH and the Ministry of Transport and Communications related to air quality, highway safety improvements, and institutional development; and 4) strengthening environmental assessment and mitigation management capacities at DOH and the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,74,82","mjthemecode":"11,9,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02071804012080","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071804012080","DocDate":"09-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123094983","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123094983","DocURL":"09-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019094749","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019094749","DocDate":"28-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135455","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135455","DocDate":"28-MAR-1994"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
