The credit will contribute to financing the costs associated with the repatriation and commencement of restoration of livelihoods of Bangladeshi migrant workers who have fled Libya due to the severe deterioration of the security situation in the country. Relief efforts in the camps in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt are mostly provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent (IFRC), while the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has been the lead agency in organizing the repatriations in close coordination with UNHCR on the ground. With the aid of the IOM, close to 30,000 Bangladeshis has been repatriated by April 13, 2011. An estimated 35,000 to 45,000 migrant workers from Bangladesh still remain in Libya, and as of April 13, around 1,000 were still in camps such as in Ra's Ajdir on the Tunisian-Libyan border awaiting repatriation. There is a continuing, but modest, daily inflow of new refugees. However, given the ongoing military action in Libya, a further surge of refugees could be expected."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Paper,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"54,58","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000350881_20130328130041","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20130328130041","DocDate":"25-MAR-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012061608435933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012061608435933","DocDate":"16-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"090224b081af54ad_2_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081af54ad_2_0","DocDate":"30-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000001843_20110502140219","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20110502140219","DocDate":"26-APR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20110421005108","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110421005108","DocDate":"19-APR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000003596_20110428144939","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000003596_20110428144939","DocDate":"18-MAR-2011"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
