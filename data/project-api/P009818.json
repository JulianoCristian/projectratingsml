The project comprises the preparation and implementation of a US$954 million investment program for increasing the production of oil and gas from the onshore Cambay Petroleum Basin located in the State of Gujarat in western India.  Specifically, assistance would be provided in (i) exploration to delineate, by seismic survey and drilling, the limits of the known producing zones.  Assistance would also provide for (ii) development and production to substantially increase the production of both oil and gas; (iii) enhanced oil recovery to test alternative technologies for increasing recoverable reserves; and (iv) technical assistance and training to ensure that ONGC staff acquire the requisite skills to successfully implement the new methodologies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"242,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"GI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","code":"GI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007163313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007163313","DocDate":"04-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902440055","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902440055","DocDate":"31-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e998fa_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e998fa_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e998f8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e998f8_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
