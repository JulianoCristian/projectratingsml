It will also help attain more effective fiscal federalism by strengthening the municipalities' capacity to assume the responsibilities being transferred to them. The project will: (a) mobilize external and internal resources in a non-deficit and non-inflationary way in order to finance justified municipal investments - particularly those contributing to productive activities; (b) strengthen municipalities' capacity to plan, finance and execute, in an efficient manner, cost-effective capital investment programs, thus assisting them to develop the capacity to eventually finance their investment needs through the private capital markets; and (c) strengthen the institutional capacity of municipalities and provinces to manage their resources more effectively and to increase the efficiency of their systems for delivery of services."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"General transportation
