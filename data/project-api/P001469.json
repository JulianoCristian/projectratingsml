The ranches would be located in a thinly populated area with a high potential for beef cattle production and close to Tananarive, the capital and largest consuming center. One of the ranches would engage in breeding imported Brahman bulls for improvement of local cattle and would serve as a center for the production and distribution of legume seed for native grassland improvement. The proposed project would also upgrade access trails to the ranches and improve main stock routes by providing water points and feeding facilities. Provision is also made in the proposed project for administrative and management services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"2,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MG","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912033076","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912033076","DocDate":"11-APR-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333038_20081025054125","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081025054125","DocDate":"11-APR-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903104162","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903104162","DocDate":"31-JAN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84b6e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84b6e_1_0","DocDate":"28-JAN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84b68_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84b68_1_0","DocDate":"28-JAN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84b67_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84b67_1_0","DocDate":"28-JAN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e67b94_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67b94_1_0","DocDate":"28-JAN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67b92_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67b92_1_0","DocDate":"28-JAN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000231615_20121116144226","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000231615_20121116144226","DocDate":"08-JAN-1969"}],"countryname":"Republic of Madagascar"}},"facets":{}}
