The project consists of five components: 1) The first component will support communities' efforts to prevent and mitigate of the impact of the HIV/AIDS crisis. Strong emphasis is given to the participatory nature of the development of community action plans. 2) The implementation of specific targeted health sector interventions geared to HIV/AIDS will be supported through this component. These include the establishment of voluntary testing and counseling center, the improvement of blood transfusion safety, and the management of blood banks, etc. 3) The third component will support the design and implementation of sector strategies. Targeted sectors include health, communication, transport, defense, education, agriculture, public works, youth and sport, tourism, women affairs, mining, environment, etc. 4) This component will provide resources to support capacity building among those sectors who are involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS. 5) This component will support the establishment of a implementation and coordination unit at the national and provincial levels."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cameroon!$!CM","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":36},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CM","sectorcode":"BH,BC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,88,59,57,67","mjthemecode":"8,7,7,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":36},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080703002650","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080703002650","DocDate":"01-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201175393","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201175393","DocURL":"07-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201175393","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201175393","DocDate":"07-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00110805385211","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00110805385211","DocDate":"24-NOV-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cameroon"}},"facets":{}}
