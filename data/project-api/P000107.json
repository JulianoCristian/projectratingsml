The project will assist a Government initiated institutional and financial rehabilitation program to restructure the rural financial sector by supporting existing cooperative rural savings and loan associations. These cooperatives are owned entirely by the rural population with no Government participation. The project provides for: (a) the institutional reform and restructuring of the existing saving and loan cooperatives; (b) restoration of cooperative members' savings and equity, depleted through accumulated losses in an inadequate policy environment, and frozen deposits in bankrupt commercial banks; (c) liberalization of interest rate policies on savings and loans; (d) training of cooperative administrators and staff; and (e) establishment of an accounting and financial control system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"2,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"33,75","mjthemecode":"10,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019122316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019122316","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120522263","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120522263","DocDate":"11-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120522263","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120522263","DocURL":"11-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e080a1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e080a1_1_0","DocDate":"30-JAN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928015351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928015351","DocDate":"03-JAN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928015537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928015537","DocDate":"03-JAN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100503003614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100503003614","DocDate":"03-JAN-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin"}},"facets":{}}
