The loan will finance a slice of FONHAPO's conventional lending program in starter dwellings, serviced lots and home improvement credits. It will also finance two special investment programs for land tenure and urban upgrading. Altogether, the project will provide new or improved housing for about 250,000 families. In addition, the project will support institutional strengthening for FONHAPO and its subborrowers and studies on building codes and administrative procedures, informal settlements and savings mobilization among low income families."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Housing finance","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"350,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Housing finance"},{"Name":"Housing construction"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"YC,FC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,25","mjthemecode":"2,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Housing finance","code":"FC"},{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":86},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961219132951","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219132951","DocDate":"26-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042013393864","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042013393864","DocDate":"23-JAN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040814131665","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040814131665","DocDate":"23-JAN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928085947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928085947","DocDate":"08-NOV-1989"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
