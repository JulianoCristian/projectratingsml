This project only has one component; all the funding will be provided by Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA) to the microfinance service provider organizations as loan funds for on-lending to microfinance clients. MISFA will provide loans to microfinance service providers under already established criteria and based on business plans that have been negotiated with and approved by MISFA. Differently structured loans from MISFA to microfinance service providers can be financed, including debt products such as subordinate debt and quasi equity where needed. Microfinance service providers would in turn use the funds for on-lending to their microfinance clients, the majority of whom are women."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of
