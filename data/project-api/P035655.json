The project seeks to improve sector efficiency and school effectiveness, and to increase access to basic educational services in targeted underserved areas. There are four main components: 1) improving learning at the primary and secondary levels by revising curriculum content and implementation, pre-service and in-service training of teachers, providing textbooks, and scaling up the ecoles temoins (pilot schools); 2) expanding access to schools in underserved and un-served areas by supporting new approaches to construction and maintenance of public schools, and municipal supervising and managing; 3) developing the institutional capacity of the ministry of national education and basic training; and 4) enhancing strategic sector planning and sector coordination by improving technical and higher education management as well as sector reform capacity and pre-investment studies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cote
