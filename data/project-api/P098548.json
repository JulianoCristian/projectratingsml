The program aims to promote economic growth and job creation through: 1) reforms to improve the investment climate, and 2) reforms to strengthen the governance and efficiency of the public sector. Improving the investment climate will depend on judicial reform, labor market reform, improving the business environment, and strengthening financial sector regulation and supervision. Strengthening public sector governance will depend on public administration reform, health sector reform, and decentralization. The reform program would be consistent with the Government's aspiration for eventual EU membership. Capacity weakness could impede full implementation of some proposed reforms. The implementation of an ambitious reform agenda sustained over several years will be a challenge given the relatively weak capacity of some public sector institutions. This PDPL series follows up on the reforms initiated under the recent Public Sector Management Adjustment Loan (PSMAL) and the Second Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL 2) as well as the reforms identified in the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)."},"country_namecode":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of!$!MK","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":22},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MK","sectorcode":"YZ,BK,BG,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"67,34,38,25,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,4,3,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":34},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":22},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":22}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090821021013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090821021013","DocDate":"22-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"008412536_2007110616025536","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=008412536_2007110616025536","DocURL":"18-SEP-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"008412536_2007110616025536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=008412536_2007110616025536","DocDate":"18-SEP-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000020953_20070307090508","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070307090508","DocDate":"27-FEB-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20070227094737","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20070227094737","DocDate":"18-JAN-2007"}],"countryname":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
