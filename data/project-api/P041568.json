The project seeks to provide support in the improvement of the population well being through the prevention of risks related to reproductive health, the reduction of illnesses among vulnerable groups, and ultimately, the reduction in infant, child, and maternal mortality rates. The major components of the project are as follows: a) Promotion of safer reproductive health behavior, by initiating an awareness of population issues, such as slower population growth; b) Implementation of an improved quality of and access to services in order to increase utilization of priority reproductive and child health programs; and c) Setting institutional capacity to improve management and coordination of such population and reproductive health programs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":88},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"11,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,63,88","mjthemecode":"8,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":88},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040716105638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040716105638","DocDate":"22-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123523739","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123523739","DocURL":"14-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123523739","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123523739","DocDate":"14-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910515484","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910515484","DocDate":"26-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184958","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184958","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
