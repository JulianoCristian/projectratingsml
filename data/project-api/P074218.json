There are six project components. The first finances the completion of the programming, testing, and implementation of the Integrated System of Management and Financial Information (SIGEF GLOBAL); completion of implementation support in Central Ministries for all modules and the provincial offices of the line ministries. The second component expands coverage of SIGEF throughout the public sector, including public universities and municipalities. The third component upgrades SIGEF's technological base by establishing a public data network and converting selected SIGEF services to web-based technology. Component 4 builds external financial audit capacity. Component 5 ensures organizational and functional support for the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) approach, which comprises macroeconomic forecasting and management, budget preparation, and tax administration. The sixth component supports project management, monitoring, supervision, and impact evaluation at the different levels of the system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de gesti\u00f3n financiera del sector p\u00fablico</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Information technology","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"13,860,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Information technology"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"CA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27","mjthemecode":"2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Information technology","code":"CA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":80},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20091021005715","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091021005715","DocDate":"30-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02031404021628","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02031404021628","DocDate":"12-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02031010371747","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02031010371747","DocDate":"25-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01112204242742","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01112204242742","DocDate":"06-JAN-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
