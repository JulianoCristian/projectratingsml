The project will help finance efficient export-oriented investments in the public and private sector through several participating banks (PBs) whose appraisal capabilities in this area will be upgraded. It will, in addition, strengthen the recently established EDB so that it can function as an apex unit for the loan, and also provide export credit guarantees and insurance needed by exporters. It will assist, furthermore, in the restructuring and expansion of an export promotion agency (EEPC); finance technical assistance to improve the efficiency and marketing capabilities of exporters, and finance specific studies of export policy and procedures as part of an agreed action program to further improve the policy and institutional environment for exports."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Industrial adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"125,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Industrial adjustment"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"II","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industrial adjustment","code":"II"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019123951","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019123951","DocDate":"28-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716150603","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716150603","DocDate":"30-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99b08_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99b08_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99b06_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99b06_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1984"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
