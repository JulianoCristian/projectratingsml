The program has been designed to:  (a) further the progress of India's long-term power plan; (b) bring potentially valuable agricultural land in Gujarat and Rajasthan under irrigation; and (c) supply domestic, municipal and industrial water for Gujarat.  The proposed project consists of dams and power complexes, including a storage reservoir extending about 210 kms upstream from the dam in Gujarat into Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.  A separate, parallel operation supported by the Bank Group will provide for the first phase construction of an extensive canal network extending for about 440 km through Gujarat to Rajasthan.  The project will install 1,450 MW of hydroelectric generating capacity and associated transmission facilities, irrigate about 1.9 million ha in Gujarat and create the potential for the irrigation of 70,000 ha in Rajasthan, and supply about 1,300 million cubic meters per annum of municipal and industrial water."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Working Paper,Working Paper,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3980625173028","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980625173028","DocDate":"29-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3980625173030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980625173030","DocDate":"29-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05cfe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05cfe_1_0","DocDate":"07-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05cfd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05cfd_1_0","DocDate":"07-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05cfc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05cfc_1_0","DocDate":"07-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05cfa_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05cfa_1_0","DocDate":"07-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99b0e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99b0e_1_0","DocDate":"07-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99b0d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99b0d_1_0","DocDate":"07-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99b0c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99b0c_1_0","DocDate":"07-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Working Paper (WP),  Vol.2","DocType":"WP","EntityID":"000333037_20090506000947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090506000947","DocDate":"06-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Working Paper (WP),  Vol.1","DocType":"WP","EntityID":"000333037_20090506000320","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090506000320","DocDate":"06-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904163006","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904163006","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151807","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151807","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
