It will also improve rural access to services through private sector investments. The four main components will: 1) create new telecommunications regulatory measures, drafting regulations for interconnection agreements, licenses, resolution of disputes, as well as radio frequency use and management, and, different types of existing and new services. Tariffs will be reviewed, in addition, design and administration of the Fund for the Development of Telecommunications (FDT) will be implemented; 2) create an autonomous telecommunications regulatory entity, through the appointment of executive management and staff, and define organizational functions. Procurement of monitoring equipment, and, office/computer equipment will be provided, together with technical assistance; 3) transfer regulatory functions to the Dominican Institute of Telecommunications (INDOTEL) upon the closure of the Directorate General of Telecommunications (DGT), and, severance compensation will be funded; 4) finance and manage the project management unit and INDOTEL, to include project audits."},"country_namecode":"Dominican Republic!$!DO","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"12,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"DO","sectorcode":"BC,CT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Rule of law","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"54,33,78,40","mjthemecode":"4,10,3,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070504110610","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070504110610","DocDate":"30-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911045996","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911045996","DocDate":"31-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201440208","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201440208","DocURL":"11-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201440309","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201440309","DocURL":"11-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99062306262645","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99062306262645","DocDate":"10-JUN-1999"}],"countryname":"Dominican Republic"}},"facets":{}}
