While supporting the nationwide expansion of the Government's ongoing family planning program, the project also concentrates on strenghthening the rural health delivery system in 20 relatively disadvantaged provinces, thereby bringing the level of service up to national standards. Specifically, the project includes the construction or expansion of nine training institutions for paramedical personnel and of about 550 rural health facilities; the provision of vehicles, equipment, contraceptives and IEC supplies; and the provision of technical assistance and professional services to assist in project implementation. Provision is also made for financing unforseen innovative activities which may be identified during project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Targeted health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"33,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Targeted health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"HT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Targeted health","code":"HT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924203054","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924203054","DocDate":"30-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b8a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b8a_1_0","DocDate":"07-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902294162","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902294162","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912162493","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912162493","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
