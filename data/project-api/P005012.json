The project is expected to improve living conditions and increase employment opportunities for an immediate design population of about 120,000 low income persons in Cairo, Alexandria, and Assiut and will be primarily executed by these three Governorates assisted by a central government unit. The project would include six closely related components: (i) comprehensive upgrading of four settlements; (ii) sites and services on two sites; (iii) a small business assistance and manpower training program; (iv) improvement in solid waste collection and disposal; (v) urgent repairs to water supply and sewerage systems; and (vi) technical assistance in project implementation and institution building."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"14,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"UM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban management","code":"UM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924185533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924185533","DocDate":"19-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912390283","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912390283","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902303555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902303555","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfcfd8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfcfd8_1_0","DocDate":"27-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfcfc5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfcfc5_1_0","DocDate":"27-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dfcfc4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfcfc4_1_0","DocDate":"27-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c17_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c17_1_0","DocDate":"27-JUN-1978"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
