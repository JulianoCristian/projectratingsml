These objectives will be achieved through the project components, as follows. First, reforms in the mining sector's legal, and regulatory framework will be implemented, followed by support to the establishment of mining administration offices - close to exploitation sites, and establishment of a certification program for gemstones, with the aim to create a one-stop shop for gemstone exports, and exchange, with a specific focus on strengthening private sector associations. Second, institutional reforms for the decentralized management of mineral resources will be supported, as will communal efforts in extending access to cadastre information at the municipal level, streamlining tax collection, and the operations of the Directorate of Mines and Geology. An important aspect will be the training program, aimed at raising human resource capacity in the sector. Third, the Mining Sector Promotion Agency will be established, and the Geo-scientific Information Infrastructure strengthened through capacity building, to attract and promote private investments in the sector. Certification procedures, administration of a small grants program, and the establishment of geological/geophysical information databases will be coordinated, including the implementation of a geological/geo-chemical mapping to increase availability of mineral resources information. Finally, project management activities shall include project procurement, financial management, and reporting requirements."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Other
