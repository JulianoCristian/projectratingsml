This paper seeks to extend the closing date for project from June 30, 2012 until December 31, 2012 to allow completion of ongoing civil works contracts which have been delayed by the slow movement of construction materials to sites-a result of rains that have worsened the already poor road conditions. The paper is also a revision to targets for some indicators in light of recent availability of more reliable data. The closing date was once again extended to June 30, 2012 when additional financing of US$14 million, mainly to support the construction of a number agricultural research and seed system facilities, was approved for the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of South Sudan!$!SS","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and
