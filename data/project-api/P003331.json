There are two components. The first, Rationalization and  Effectiveness of Agricultural Services and Policymaking, 1) supports the preparation and initial implementation of sub-sectoral strategic plans by the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture (MoLA) for agricultural research, extension, and veterinary services; 2) facilitates the planning, implementation, and evaluation of pilot efforts to commercialize, out-source, or privatize selected public agricultural services; 3) finances competitive and collaborative research and advisory services that support smallholder agriculture; 4) provides equipment to improve effectiveness and client-responsiveness; and 5) finances analysis and consensus-building on outstanding and emerging policy issues. The second component, Efficient Resource Management, improves MoLA's management of human resources through training and reallocating and/or retrenching selected staff; designs and implements improved financial and accounting systems and practices and decentralizes them; strengthens the use of information technology; and improves the quality of MoLA's institutional reform process."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zimbabwe!$!ZW","sector1":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":63},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":13},"sector3":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"8,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ZW","sectorcode":"ET,AB,EV,BC,AJ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Economic management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"24,83,25,77","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,2,11,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":63},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13},{"Name":"Education","Percent":11},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0202020408482","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0202020408482","DocDate":"23-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980624142731","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624142731","DocDate":"30-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929174031","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929174031","DocDate":"05-MAR-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zimbabwe","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
