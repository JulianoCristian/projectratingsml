The program components supported by the loan are: (a) the rehabilitation of some 420 km of primary and secondary roads; (b) technical assistance for improving the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation's organizational arrangements and procedures for highway rehabilitation and reconstruction; (c) purchase of maintenance equipment; and (d) technical assistance and training services to implement the Government's highway maintenance program. In addition, the project will strengthen road administration through a clearer division of responsibilities between the Ministry and local authorities. The project will first benefit vehicle operators and the transport industry, and later producers and consumers. Because of the ambitious size of the project, its major risk, special measures have been designed to afford adequate flexibility."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Costa Rica!$!CR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CR","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96198_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96198_1_0","DocDate":"15-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902351599","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902351599","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912491450","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912491450","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Costa Rica"}},"facets":{}}
