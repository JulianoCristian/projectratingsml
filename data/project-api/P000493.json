The project consists of 14 subprojects leading to: i) increased development of crop farming; ii) sustained and improved animal health services; iii) maintenance of water supply; iv) expansion of forestry activities; and v) increase in the Government's capacity to deliver transport services. Benefits from the vaccination subproject, which is by far the largest subproject, at 27 percent of total base cost, would accrue to some 250,000 families. Increases in output under seven other subprojects would benefit about 20,000 families or 75,000 people. The remaining subprojects are aimed at improving the region's productive base, facilitating access to remote areas and saving costs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"1,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TD","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904163429","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904163429","DocDate":"29-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000334955_20081025060629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20081025060629","DocDate":"29-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b67_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b67_1_0","DocDate":"06-SEP-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902285250","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902285250","DocDate":"31-AUG-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191206462","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191206462","DocDate":"04-AUG-1977"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chad"}},"facets":{}}
