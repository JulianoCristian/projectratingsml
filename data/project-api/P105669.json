There are three components to the project. The first component is the business facilitation. This component will support activities that aim to strengthen investment climate reforms in order to induce supply-side investment responses and accelerate economic growth. The second component is the public enterprise reform. Reduction of the budgetary burden of the parastatals and improvement in the efficiency and delivery of public services are key objectives of the Government. A public enterprise reform program is under preparation and parts of it are already being implemented. But there is a need for further development of the program design, a need to improve the management and coordination of the program and the flow of information on public enterprise performance, and to provide assistance to the sector ministries and public enterprises who will be involved in designing and implementing these reforms. Finally, the third component is the utility regulation and public private partnerships. The growth of private sector firms within the economy, especially those focusing on export-led growth as in the case of Mauritius, is impacted by the quality of infrastructure service delivery which forms an integral part of the investment climate. Improving the coverage and quality of these services through increased private participation in ownership and management is therefore a key focus under the Government's investment climate enhancement strategy and under the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mauritius!$!MU","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Maurice : Projet d\u2019assistance technique pour la transition \u00e9conomique</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le Projet sur la transition \u00e9conomique a pour objectif d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les r\u00e9sultats de certaines entreprises et certains services publics qui contribuent \u00e0 l\u2019instauration d\u2019un meilleur climat d\u2019investissement \u00e0 l\u2019Ile Maurice. Le projet comprend trois composantes. La composante 1 a trait \u00e0 la facilitation des affaires. Cette composante doit permettre de financer les activit\u00e9s qui visent \u00e0 renforcer les r\u00e9formes du climat d\u2019investissement, dans le but non seulement de stimuler les effets induits par l\u2019investissement ax\u00e9 sur l\u2019offre, mais \u00e9galement d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer la croissance \u00e9conomique. La composante 2 porte sur la r\u00e9forme des entreprises publiques. La r\u00e9duction du poids sur le budget des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s parapubliques et l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et de la fourniture des services publics sont les objectifs principaux du gouvernement. Un programme de r\u00e9formes des entreprises publiques est en cours de pr\u00e9paration, et certaines de ses composantes sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cours de r\u00e9alisation. Mais il est indispensable non seulement de poursuivre la conception du programme, l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de la gestion et de la coordination du programme et du flux de l\u2019information sur les r\u00e9sultats des entreprises publiques, mais \u00e9galement d\u2019aider les minist\u00e8res et les entreprises publiques du secteur \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la conception et \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de ces r\u00e9formes. Enfin, la composante 3 porte sur la r\u00e9glementation applicable aux services publics et sur les partenariats public/priv\u00e9. L\u2019essor des entreprises du secteur priv\u00e9 au sein de l\u2019\u00e9conomie, notamment celles qui se concentrent sur la croissance induite par les exportations comme c\u2019est le cas \u00e0 l\u2019Ile Maurice, tire profit de la qualit\u00e9 de la fourniture des services d\u2019infrastructure qui est une composante du climat d\u2019investissement. L\u2019am\u00e9lioration de la couverture et de la qualit\u00e9 de ces services par le biais d\u2019une meilleure participation du priv\u00e9 dans l\u2019appropriation et la gestion est par cons\u00e9quent un important centre d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat dans le cadre du projet et de la strat\u00e9gie du gouvernement pour un meilleur climat d\u2019investissement.</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Public administration- Industry and trade","Percent":41},"sector2":{"Name":"Public administration- Water, sanitation and flood
