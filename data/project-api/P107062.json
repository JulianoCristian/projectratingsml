P135-2 and the particular policy areas that are the focus of the series of operations are judged to represent the best available entry points to a wider, emerging agenda for systemic change in the way NTP in Vietnam are conceived and implemented. This reform agenda aims broadly to promote informed participation and civic engagement at community level in the Government's targeted public investment programs, as well as improved targeting, fiduciary management, transparency and monitoring and evaluation, as primary means to improve the results of these programs in many cases by transferring and mainstreaming approaches successfully piloted under smaller-scale, donor financed investment projects working in the same program areas."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":46},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":18},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":30},"theme3":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":10},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":15},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"AZ,BC,JB,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,53,27,57","mjthemecode":"7,2,6,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":46},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":18},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20121105003201","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20121105003201","DocDate":"28-SEP-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2009112414060573","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009112414060573","DocDate":"09-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2009112414060573","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009112414060573","DocURL":"09-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333038_20090504025733","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090504025733","DocDate":"21-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090217154407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090217154407","DocDate":"26-JAN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20081007124001","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20081007124001","DocDate":"23-SEP-2008"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}},"facets":{}}
