Services will be provided by the citizen's own local governments, via partnerships between the public and private sector, the private sector and executive agencies, all accountable to citizens. It will be a citizen's right rather than a privilege to have access to public services. The project will have a major impact on improving governance and citizens empowerment by making the Government more responsive to business needs and promoting private sector growth. Improved delivery of social and economic services will help citizens reach their full productive potential. The project components are: 1) begin a process of restructuring central government; 2) professionalization by motivating public servants to become more responsive to the needs of citizens; 3) governance by improving allocation, efficient use and accountability of public resources; and 4) program coordination by enhancing capacity to coordinate and monitor the reforms and communicate with key stockholders."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"25,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,27,29,25","mjthemecode":"2,2,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000442464_20140709095558","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20140709095558","DocDate":"27-JUN-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20060309155904","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20060309155904","DocDate":"09-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061016274809","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061016274809","DocDate":"16-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03031804015835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03031804015835","DocDate":"12-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_03011704010582","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03011704010582","DocDate":"13-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01111604030120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01111604030120","DocDate":"12-OCT-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique"}},"facets":{}}
