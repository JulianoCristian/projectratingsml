The project will improve external efficiency by: 1) establishing a curriculum planning and evaluation unit to reformulate the subject-based curriculum, for both the scientific-humanistic and technical-vocational secondary schools; 2) developing evaluation capacity to monitor the consistency between the recommended and the learned curriculum; 3) establishing alternative curricular activities for socially and educationally at-risk secondary students; 4) providing incentives to strengthen the linkages between targeted technical-vocational schools and the private sector in curriculum development, skill certification, in-service teacher training, and the use of physical facilities. The project will improve quality, equity, and internal efficiency by: 1) providing in-service teacher training to change the predominantly one-dimensional teaching format based mainly on rote learning and dictation, to more interactive methods; 2) establishing a fund to promote the design and implementation of school-based educational development projects; and 3) providing educational resources in a targeted manner. Finally, the project will also include components to strengthen sectoral managerial capacity."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":83},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"ET,ES,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"51,61,65,66","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Education","Percent":83},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0111160402132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0111160402132","DocDate":"19-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123073489","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123073489","DocURL":"31-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123073388","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123073388","DocDate":"31-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123073388","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123073388","DocURL":"31-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123073489","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123073489","DocDate":"31-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3c22_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3c22_1_0","DocDate":"09-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019101337","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019101337","DocDate":"11-APR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile"}},"facets":{}}
