Project components include: 1) restoration of the NAS area, through the construction of a closure dike in the Bering Strait, a channel connecting the NAS, and the larger southern Aral Sea (LAS), and, conveying additional flows into the NAS. Current excessive spills will be diverted into the Arnasai depression into the Syr Darya river, to reduce river losses by the construction of flood protection dikes. Major obstructions to river flows between the Chardarah dam and the NAS will be removed, to straighten the river at three locations; 2) improvements on the hydraulic control of the Syr Darya, through an increased capacity of the Syr Darya entity, and diverting downstream flows towards the delta ecosystem to further restore the NAS. Major water infrastructure will be rehabilitated on the Syr Darya and Karaozek branch, to improve irrigated areas, lakes, and hayfields in the basin, while river bed erosion resulting from receding sea water levels will also be improved, through the installation of weirs at Aklak, and hydraulic works for delta lakes, and wetland ecosystems; 3) rehabilitation of the Chardarah dam, through the financing of a first phase program, provided the dam embankment stability is ensured, and additional geo-technical research, and, further hydrological research are undertaken; 4) aquatic resources restoration, and fisheries development through detailed preparation, and implementation phases, anticipating technical assistance, policy reforms, and a new cooperative trading organization, in addition to co-financing possibilities; and, 5) monitoring and evaluation will be provided, and, project "},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kazakhstan!$!KZ","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and
