This will be achieved through the development of a tertiary distribution system, the establishment of an operation and maintenance service for the Marib Flood Control/Irrigation Scheme, and the strengthening of agricultural support services in the area. The project also aims at establishing a strong institutional framework for addressing the longer term agricultural development needs of the Eastern Region, through the strengthening of ERADA (Eastern Region Agricultural Development Authority) and the augmenting of agricultural research. The project will provide to these services and institutions: development facilities in the form of technical staff, staff training, expert/consultant services, tertiary canals, buildings, vehicles and equipment. Also, the project will provide, through farmer participation, investments needed for on-farm development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":41},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":46},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"AB,AI,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83,78,75,59,85","mjthemecode":"11,7,10,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":41},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":46},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980630180621","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980630180621","DocDate":"21-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121483678","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121483678","DocURL":"24-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121483678","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121483678","DocDate":"24-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121485379","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121485379","DocDate":"24-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121485379","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121485379","DocURL":"24-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e083cf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e083cf_1_0","DocDate":"31-JAN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927094645","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927094645","DocDate":"23-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927094510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927094510","DocDate":"20-DEC-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
