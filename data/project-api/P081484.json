The closing date for the project will be extended from September 30, 2011 until April 30, 2012. The extension is required since implementation has been slowed by several factors: 1) new procedures applied late last year by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement have significantly lengthened the turn-around time for replenishing the special account, which in turn constrained financing of sub-projects; 2) several procurements for consultants (including the impact evaluation and technical audits) needed to be re-launched internationally because the processes did not yield applicants of sufficient capacity; and 3) the preparation of boites a outils in some ministries. The project has submitted a new work plan covering the period from June 2011 to April 2012 that presents a credible program for finishing all activities by the revised closing date.  This will be the second extension of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"Other social
