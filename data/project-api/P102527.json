The project will be coordinated and administered by the Ministry of Interior, and implemented by the three incumbent providers of water supply and sewerage services in the three selected urban centers, namely Casablanca, Tangiers, and Meknes. All participating utilities will promote the 'National Initiative for Human Development-Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (INDH-GPOBA) connection program' to households in the selected 'quartiers', will receive applications from individual households, make connections and be reimbursed a pre-agreed amount upon evidence of a functional and used connection. The pilot project will make payments to service providers out of a common \"OBA fund\" that will form the basis for a later scale up into a national OBA program."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"7,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sewerage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"WS,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0002530335","geoLocName":"Tangier","latitude":"35.767269","longitude":"-5.7997499","country":"MA"},{"geoLocId":"0002542710","geoLocName":"R\u00e9gion de Mekn\u00e8s-Tafilalet","latitude":"32.166672","longitude":"-4.8000002","country":"MA"},{"geoLocId":"0002542715","geoLocName":"Mekn\u00e8s","latitude":"33.89352","longitude":"-5.5472698","country":"MA"},{"geoLocId":"0002553604","geoLocName":"Casablanca","latitude":"33.58831","longitude":"-7.6113801","country":"MA"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"71","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"9,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":50},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120720012122","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120720012122","DocDate":"29-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012011112234116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012011112234116","DocDate":"11-JAN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011062610103854","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011062610103854","DocDate":"26-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20120323003121","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120323003121","DocDate":"21-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010103110262261","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010103110262261","DocDate":"31-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000334955_20100302014757","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100302014757","DocDate":"30-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000334955_20090708050427","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090708050427","DocDate":"21-AUG-2006"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
