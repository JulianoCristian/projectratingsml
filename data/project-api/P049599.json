There are five main components. The first, Community Subprojects, finances demand-driven community-based socio-economic infrastructure projects, social mobilization and capacity building, beneficiary targeting, and project monitoring and evaluation. The second component, Public Works, finances labor-intensive works as a safety net scheme, and includes information, education, and communication (IEC) activities. The third component sponsors subprojects to construct and rehabilitate facilities and provide services (including transportation, care, etc.) to benefit vulnerable, and includes IEC activities that focus on sensitization and clarification. The fourth component, capacity enhancement, strengthens the capacity of the Management Unit and supports capacity building for all other stakeholders involved in implementing subprojects. The fifth component finances incremental operating costs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"66,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"JA,WZ,JB,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"78,74,57,54,56","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,6,7,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040603142910","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040603142910","DocDate":"26-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00081705310171","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081705310171","DocDate":"04-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201014018","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201014018","DocDate":"04-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201013917","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201013917","DocURL":"04-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201013917","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201013917","DocDate":"04-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000178830_98111703552798","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703552798","DocDate":"17-SEP-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
