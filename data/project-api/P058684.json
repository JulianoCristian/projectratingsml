The project is a follow-up to the first phase project, and will continue to improve infrastructure services. Nevertheless, the strategy will be redefined to target marginal and poor communities, thus, poverty alleviation and human resource development becomes the overall sector objective, with emphasis on poor areas identification, focusing on labor-intensive micro-projects, which will not only preserve capital assets, but increase and promote local job opportunities. Significant portions of project activities are expected to take place in refugee camps, to be implemented with no prejudice against the refugees's inalienable rights. The components of the project include: 1) Local government units will identify and implement infrastructure micro-projects. Mostly local contractors, suppliers and laborers will perform work improvements in infrastructure. 2) Technical assistance will be provided to local governments to ensure high quality and responsiveness in micro-project implementation. Technical assistance will also be provided for project management, and to local contractors. 3) Supplemental operating costs will be provided for project execution and management."},"country_namecode":"West Bank and Gaza!$!GZ","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":88},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GZ","sectorcode":"BC,BH,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"87,58,57,54,51","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,6,7,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":88},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030625134520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030625134520","DocDate":"18-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050411495016","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050411495016","DocDate":"06-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99032505565538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99032505565538","DocDate":"10-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703530641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703530641","DocDate":"10-FEB-1999"}],"countryname":"West Bank and Gaza","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
