The objectives of DPL 2 policy areas are to: (a) strengthen budget management, (b) create a more efficient civil service, (c) reduce the role of the state in commercial areas of the economy, (d) improve public corporate governance, and (e) remove administrative barriers to doing business. The reform of the business climate for the private sector takes a more prominent role in the DPL 2, as the government embarks on second generation reforms that include licensing reforms, investment climate reforms, and reform of work permit procedures."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Seychelles!$!SC","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":33},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":42},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Summary of Discussion,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"SC","sectorcode":"YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,27,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":67},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":33}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011122502521607","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011122502521607","DocDate":"25-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120316011204","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120316011204","DocDate":"04-OCT-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000334955_20101125020411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20101125020411","DocDate":"23-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000370910_20101102102052","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000370910_20101102102052","DocDate":"26-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000020953_20101013120046","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20101013120046","DocDate":"09-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100910085048","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100910085048","DocDate":"09-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100617095308","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100617095308","DocDate":"10-JUN-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Seychelles","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
