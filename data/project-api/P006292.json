It would include traffic engineering measures to improve circulation in central areas; introduction of exclusive bus lanes; traffic operations programs to improve capacity and safety (TOPICS) to alleviate critical congestion points; widening or construction of missing links in the urban road networks; reorganization and construction of bus terminals; and paving of bus routes in low-income areas. The project would also include an extensive technical assistance program for the sector. Seventy-three percent of the investments in Curitiba, Rectife and Salvador would directly benefit people with per capita incomes below one-third the national average and sixty-seven percent in Porto Alegre. A similar percentage is expected to apply to the investments in Belo Horizonte."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban transport","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"88,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban transport"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"TU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban transport","code":"TU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925021522","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925021522","DocDate":"14-NOV-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c8a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c8a_1_0","DocDate":"09-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c89_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c89_1_0","DocDate":"09-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c88_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c88_1_0","DocDate":"09-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c87_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c87_1_0","DocDate":"09-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c86_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c86_1_0","DocDate":"09-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c85_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c85_1_0","DocDate":"09-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c81_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c81_1_0","DocDate":"09-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84c7f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84c7f_1_0","DocDate":"09-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912382022","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912382022","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902300813","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902300813","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
