The project has two components. The first component develops a private sector student loan program to improve access to private education for students who are academically qualified but financially needy. It designs selection criteria, decides the terms and conditions of student loans, and determines the legal and institutional arrangements for program administration. A second sub-component supports the start-up costs of the student loan program--costs related to establishing the central and satellite offices, setting up a coherent management information system, developing a marketing and promotion strategy, and financing equipment and technical assistance. The second component strengthens the Sonora (the Institute of Educational Credit of the State of Sonora) Student Loan Program by revising its evaluation and selections instruments to better reflect targeting goals; carries out a yearly survey of the socioeconomic background of its beneficiaries; changes the terms and conditions of its loans; and makes legal and institutional arrangements for program administration. This component also provides technical assistance to help the Institute design and implement a long-term institutional development plan as well as equipment (computer) and training."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"180,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BH,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"65,66","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070731115357","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070731115357","DocDate":"27-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201400336","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201400336","DocURL":"14-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201400034","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201400034","DocDate":"14-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201400034","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201400034","DocURL":"14-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201400235","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201400235","DocURL":"14-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201400235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201400235","DocDate":"14-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201400336","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201400336","DocDate":"14-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980804142323","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980804142323","DocDate":"04-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184715","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184715","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
