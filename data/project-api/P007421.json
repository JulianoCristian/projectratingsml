Physical investment will be concentrated in installing transmission and distribution facilities. The Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange costs of that part of JPSC's 1978-82 transmission distribution program that has not been financed by other sources. The project would also assist JPSC in improving its operating and maintenance practices and its pricing policies through the use of specialized consulting services and through training its staff. In line with the Government's social objectives, the JPSC program includes making public service electricity available to low income and rural customers. Domestic bidders would receive a 15% margin of preference in bidding on project items. The project does not pose any significant risks other than what are normally associated with this type of undertaking."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"JM","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925015004","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925015004","DocDate":"17-FEB-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f49_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f49_1_0","DocDate":"07-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f48_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f48_1_0","DocDate":"07-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902294265","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902294265","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"}],"countryname":"Jamaica"}},"facets":{}}
