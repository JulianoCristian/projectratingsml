Halving the proportion of people suffering from extreme poverty and hunger is possible by 2015 if AP is able to sustain the achievements of the 1990s. Although poverty has declined in AP, the reduction is smaller than in other Indian states, particularly when compared with the other Southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and the pace of poverty reduction has been relatively slower in rural areas. In order to meet its poverty reduction goals, the challenge for AP is to improve the access of the poor to credit and social services (particularly, health and education), especially in rural areas. The goal of universal primary enrollment by 2015 is likely to be met, but achieving the targeted completion and retention rates will be a challenge. There has been progress towards gender equality in the labor market and in education, but targeted interventions are clearly necessary in order to eliminate the gender gap in education. Despite its recent efforts in improving school enrollments, the state continues to lag behind other states in literacy and education outcomes. Moreover, there are significant disparities across location, gender, income group and social category. The state is making efforts to address these problems. In the health sector, the challenges are even bigger. The state is on track to achieve its target of reducing maternal mortality to three-quarters of its 1990 level by 2015, and the goal of halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water is also likely to met. Despite the very clear emphasis on health outcomes in Vision 2020 , however, the sector lacks a clear focus on outcomes and would benefit from a more focused strategy. The major health status indicators are worse in AP than in comparator southern states, and in some cases improvem"},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":7},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":6},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"220,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"JA,EZ,YZ,BE,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"53,28,43,25,27","mjthemecode":"2,2,4,2,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":75},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":6},{"Name":"Education","Percent":6},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050329105516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050329105516","DocDate":"31-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000090341_20040120103124","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040120103124","DocDate":"09-JAN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20031218130239","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20031218130239","DocDate":"15-DEC-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
