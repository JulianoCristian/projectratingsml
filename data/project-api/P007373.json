It seeks to alleviate key constraints to the Ministry of Public Education's (SEP) capacity to effectively plan and carry out needed investments and administer the educational system.  On this basis, the project seeks to strengthen the structure and management capacity of SEP and to decentralize the management of rural primary education.  To this end, the Rural Primary Education Management Project for Honduras aims to enhance the management capacity and performance of SEP through technical assistance.  It also seeks to assist SEP in developing and testing an effective management and development planning system for rural primary education which is designed to economize on expenditures, improve cost-effectiveness and establish the basis for raising student achievement.  In line with this, the project provides technical assistance and a micro-planning effort for rural schools in the project area."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":56},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":44},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"4,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"65,61,27","mjthemecode":"2,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":56},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":44}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20040805112215","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040805112215","DocDate":"14-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019224244","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019224244","DocDate":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041614585035","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041614585035","DocDate":"27-AUG-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras"}},"facets":{}}
