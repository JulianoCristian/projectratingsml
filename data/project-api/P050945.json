There are two project components. The first covers school-level interventions designed to support the government's efforts to improve the quality of both the teaching/learning processes and the physical surroundings in which basic education students learn. The subcomponents will a) support quality teaching innovation; use new information and communication technologies; extend, equip, and maintain school infrastructure; and reinforce in-service training capacity. The second component covers system-wide reforms aimed at strengthening evaluation and remediation, research, and school- and regional-level management capacities. The subcomponents will systematize assessment of students, teachers, and institutions; strengthen education research capacity; improve knowledge of the management techniques and tools of the education system; and regulate student flows."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":83},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":4},"sector4":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"99,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Agreement","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"EV,ET,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,78,65,66","mjthemecode":"8,8,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":83},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Education","Percent":4},{"Name":"Education","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20071004121812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20071004121812","DocDate":"29-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070504100440","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070504100440","DocDate":"29-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070924152749","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070924152749","DocDate":"29-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20071212161341","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20071212161341","DocDate":"29-MAR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201534722","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201534722","DocURL":"15-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20040722125635","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040722125635","DocDate":"30-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00061705502666","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00061705502666","DocDate":"30-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00051105320125","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051105320125","DocDate":"28-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042211310111","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042211310111","DocDate":"09-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
