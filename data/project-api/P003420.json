The objective will be to help raise investment efficiency through import of technology and the introduction of improved project design and selection methodology.  Subborrowers will be some 60-80 state and collective enterprises primarily in coastal provinces and municipalities. Based on the experience under CIB I, the investments are expected to have high financial and economic returns. The main project risks relate to the capacity of CIB, which is a young institution, to strengthen its appraisal standards, especially  in the technical, economic and marketing areas, and to the need for continued government commitment to CIB within the process of economic reform.  However, the project provides for recruitment of additional technical and economic staff, plus training and marketing consultancy for CIB's ability to identify and evaluate projects.  Furthermore, the Government's commitment to economic reforms and to CIB remain firm."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5de5\u4e1a\u4fe1\u8d37\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e2d\u56fd\u6295\u8d44\u94f6\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7531\u5176\u5411\u9700\u8981\u5916\u6c47\u7684\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6295\u8d44\u8d37\u6b3e\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u534f\u52a9\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6295\u8d44\u6548\u7387\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u4e3a60-80\u5bb6\u56fd\u6709\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e3b\u8981\u4f4d\u4e8e\u6cbf\u6d77\u7701\u5e02\u3002\u6839\u636e\u7b2c\u4e00\u5de5\u4e1a\u4fe1\u8d37\u9879\u76ee\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u6709\u671b\u4ea7\u751f\u8f83\u9ad8\u8d22\u52a1\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6536\u76ca\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u98ce\u9669\u540c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u5173\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u65b0\u7ec4\u5efa\u673a\u6784\u4e2d\u56fd\u6295\u8d44\u94f6\u884c\u5b8c\u5584\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6280\u672f\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u8425\u9500\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u653f\u5e9c\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6539\u9769\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7eed\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u56fd\u6295\u8d44\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002\u9274\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u8d44\u52a9\u62db\u8058\u66f4\u591a\u6280\u672f\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u8425\u9500\u54a8\u8be2\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e2d\u56fd\u6295\u8d44\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u4ecd\u575a\u5b9a\u5b9e\u884c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6539\u9769\u548c\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u56fd\u6295\u8d44\u94f6\u884c\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"175,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925142816","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925142816","DocDate":"03-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c54_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c54_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c50_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c50_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99ac1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99ac1_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99abf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99abf_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1984"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
