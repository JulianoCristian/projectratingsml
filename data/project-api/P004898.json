It will also help increase the efficiency of the water distribution system in Greater Algiers. Assistance will be provided to strengthen sector planning and institutional development. The project will also assist in further strengthening EPEAL's organization, accounts, procedures and financial policies. The project comprises: (i) construction of two dams, pumping facilities, a water treatment plant and water conveyance systems; (ii) expansion and improvement of the water distribution system of Greater Algiers; and (iii) technical assistance and studies. The project will benefit about 3.5 million inhabitants of Greater Algiers, of which about one-third are residents of low-income districts, and will also supply water for industrial and commercial development."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"290,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019140525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019140525","DocDate":"14-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716150527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716150527","DocDate":"30-JUN-1984"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
