Thus, the Public Procurement Reform Project aims at supporting public procurement reform, by introducing appropriate rules and procedures, building procurement management capacity, and establishing the mechanisms to improve transparency. The project components will: 1) establish a Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU), created as a permanent institution funded under revenue budget, at the Ministry of Planning, whose responsibility will be to prod procurement reforms in line with the recommendations of the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). CPTU may provide technical/professional advice, but shall not provide opinion on procurement evaluations, or awards, in order to preserve its role as policy, technical assistance, training, and oversight unit; 2) implement public procurement reforms, and, rules and procedures, and help develop standard bidding documents in line with the CPAR recommendations, while the CPTU will follow a participatory consultation process involving government, and private sector stakeholders, to develop ownership, and support reforms; and, 3) improve procurement management capacity by institutionalizing comprehensive, and regular training programs through selected institutions, and, by establishing a monitoring and evaluation capacity at CPTU to monitor the procurement performance of public entities."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"4,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27","mjthemecode":"2,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080702024537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080702024537","DocDate":"25-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031117252571","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031117252571","DocDate":"13-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02020104034974","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02020104034974","DocDate":"07-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02041604003081","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02041604003081","DocDate":"04-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02020104020169","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02020104020169","DocDate":"27-FEB-2002"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
