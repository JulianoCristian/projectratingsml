Specific objectives are to: 1) rehabilitate federal highways; 2) decentralize highway responsibilities to state governments; 3) increase the participation of the private sector in the management and financing of highways through concessions and maintenance management contracts; and 4) strengthen the capabilities of the National Roads Department and the State Road Departments to prepare, contract and monitor efficient network rehabilitation and maintenance programs and highway concession projects. The project will consist of three main components: (a) highway decentralization, including: (i) technical assistance and training services; and (ii) state rehabilitation subprojects; (b) highway concession development, including: (i) technical assistance and training services; and (ii) concession studies; and (c) federal highway comprising: (i) technical assistance and training services; and (ii) federal rehabilitation subprojects."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BH,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"44,26,47","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"5,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060629120404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060629120404","DocDate":"06-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123142650","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123142650","DocURL":"10-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123142650","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123142650","DocDate":"10-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123142348","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123142348","DocURL":"10-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123142449","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123142449","DocURL":"10-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123142449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123142449","DocDate":"10-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123142348","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123142348","DocDate":"10-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172106","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172106","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102345","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102345","DocDate":"20-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
