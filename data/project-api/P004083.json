In order to support KDFC's efforts to provide financial assistance to small- and medium-scale, relatively labor-intensive enterprises, a component of $20 million will be earmarked for financing specifically: (a) enterprises with fixed assets not exceeding $750,000; or (b) projects generating employment at a fixed investment cost per job not greater than $12,500. Also, in order to finance small- and medium-sized leasing projects, an amount of up to $10.0 million of the proceeds of the loan will be made available to the Korea Development Leasing Corporation (KDLC), a leasing company affiliated to KDFC, by way of subloans. The loan will finance projects creating an estimated 10,000 new jobs. There are no special risks associated with the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925013148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925013148","DocDate":"15-JUL-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3c3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3c3_1_0","DocDate":"05-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3c2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3c2_1_0","DocDate":"05-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902315489","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902315489","DocDate":"30-NOV-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912403511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912403511","DocDate":"31-OCT-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
