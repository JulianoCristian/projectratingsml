As a result, the Gabes region, the main industrial center in southern Tunisia, will face a significant energy supply deficit by 1993, since it depends on this associated gas for fuel supply. Bank analyses have confirmed that it would be more economic to continue to supply Gabes and its region with natural gas rather than convert existing industries to fuel oil and transfer some of STEG's (Tunisian Company for Electricity and Gas) power generation facilities in Gabes further north on the TMP (Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline). The project will provide a least-cost energy supply alternative for Gabes and other gas markets along the pipeline route. A gas infrastructure network in the southern part of the country to facilitate domestic gas field development will be established. The increased use of natural gas in the industrial and premium fuels markets will be promoted. In addition, the project will develop a sound gas subsector strategy while rationalizing and strengthening the subsector's institutional model. A modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system will be developed to enhance the security of the gas supply."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"86,39,49,82","mjthemecode":"11,5,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122483369","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122483369","DocURL":"05-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122483369","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122483369","DocDate":"05-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122483470","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122483470","DocDate":"05-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122483470","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122483470","DocURL":"05-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001043921","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001043921","DocDate":"21-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001044153","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001044153","DocDate":"21-OCT-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
