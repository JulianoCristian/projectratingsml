The main components are: (a) provision for a line of credit to BRD including: i) at most US$4.4 million to help BRD finance larger projects; ii) at least US$2.5 million for BRD's proposed program; and (b) US$0.1 million to help Government carry out studies for the development of an SSE program and of the interest rate structure in Rwanda. Benefits: Private and public sector investment would be promoted. BRD's capabilities and procedures particularly as regards assistance to SSE development would continue to be strengthened and improved.
