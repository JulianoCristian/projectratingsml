HDFC's average loan for Rs 40,000 (about US$3,000) finances about 45 percent of the total housing cost.  Technical assistance supports HDFC's institutional development, branching to new geographic areas and development of new mortgage instruments, especially for lower-income groups.  The project also supports HDFC's own technical assistance to other emerging housing finance corporations for their establishment of operating procedures and control systems.  The project supports the development of market-oriented finance in India.  It comes at a critical time in the Government debate, whether to encourage housing finance mainly through directed credit or competitive resource mobilization."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"UH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban housing","code":"UH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926163310","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926163310","DocDate":"17-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926163133","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926163133","DocDate":"21-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926162804","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926162804","DocDate":"12-FEB-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
