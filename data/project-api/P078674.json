The project has three major components. The first addresses cross-cutting problems inpublic expenditure management: budget formulation, budget execution, and procurement, focusing particularly on high-spending ministries. The remaining components support policy and procedural reforms in two key sectors. One ofthese is healthcare, with three sub-components, which will: finance implementation of the family medicine model in four municipalities; test a new system for paying providers; and provide limited training for the Ministry of Health on management, policy development and planning, and communication skills.  The other component concerns transport, which will contribute to improving both the management and use of public expenditure in the transport sector via four sub-components: expenditure allocation, financial sustainability, road safety, and traffic management by the Pristina Municipality."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kosovo!$!XK","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":69},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"5,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"XK","sectorcode":"TA,BK,BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Human development"],"themecode":"89,39,27,67","mjthemecode":"8,2,4,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":69},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20100303012921","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100303012921","DocDate":"21-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000112742_20050527113845","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050527113845","DocDate":"15-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20041109102245","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20041109102245","DocDate":"19-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20041109111109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20041109111109","DocDate":"19-OCT-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kosovo"}},"facets":{}}
