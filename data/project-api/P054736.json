The project comprises five components. 1) The seed market development component will ensure farmer access to a full range of seed technology and to foster establishment and development of public and private seed-related institutions suitable for market economies. 2) The land market development component will support the physical and institutional development of the Immovable Property Registration System and a pilot Land Consolidation Project. 3) The market development component will support a variety of measures essential for the establishment and promotion of functioning market channels, marketing facilities, and export opportunities. 4) The community-based rural productivity and marketing improvement component will assist emerging smallholder farmers and other rural entrepreneurs to develop their businesses by improving their access to information and knowledge needed to improve productivity, diversify production, and add value to their products; and by exploiting market opportunities. This component will award small grants under a competitive grant program. 5) The project management component will establish a Project Management Unit to implement various project activities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":46},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"9,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AL","sectorcode":"AB,BC,YA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,78,75","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":46},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":34},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080910234805","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080910234805","DocDate":"08-SEP-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201220660","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201220660","DocURL":"03-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01053004081751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01053004081751","DocDate":"16-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060204005784","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060204005784","DocDate":"16-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99090911465321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99090911465321","DocDate":"15-MAY-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Albania","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
