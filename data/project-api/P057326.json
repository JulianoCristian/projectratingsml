There are three project components. The first component 1) designs the methodologies and operational mechanisms to be tested, improved, and adapted; 2) designs and implements a communications strategy to enhance awareness and generate support for conserving biodiversity and sustainable development; 3) supports study tours and visits, farmer exchanges, and workshops to promote exchange of knowledge and experience; 4) funds key studies and action-research to develop new information; and 5) finances the project's monitoring, evaluation, and learning system. The second component provides technical support to agencies coordinating a sustainable development plan; promotes a network of stakeholders; supports the consultation process between indigenous organizations, the parks unit, and peasants living inside the parks; and implements a strategic plan for strengthening the Foundation (the Strategic Development Plan for the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta). The third component is the core investment component. It consists of three inter-related sub-components implementing collaborative management plans; promoting a stewardship approach for protected areas; and operating a grant-giving fund."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":21},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"EZ,JB,BH,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"80,82,60,76,57","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,10,7,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":43},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":21},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":21},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070918111631","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070918111631","DocDate":"01-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20060601143828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060601143828","DocDate":"01-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"007003174_2006082110200774","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007003174_2006082110200774","DocURL":"23-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"007003174_2006082110200774","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007003174_2006082110200774","DocDate":"23-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00060605301821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00060605301821","DocDate":"25-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00041905585682","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00041905585682","DocDate":"06-APR-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
