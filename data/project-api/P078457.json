In line with the priorities set out in the Serbia Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) - directed at improving the business climate; enhancing the performance in the energy sector; strengthening social protection; and, improving public administration, the successful implementation of these policy measures should a) enhance fiscal discipline; b) encourage a strong private sector response, and employment creation; c) set the stage for deeper reforms aimed at improving public administration; d) address the problem of low-coverage, and under-funding of Serbia's well-targeted social assistance programs; and, e) mitigate the adverse impact of the energy sector reform measures on the poor. There are, however, a number of issues to be sorted out among ruling coalition partners, and the party of the newly elected President, which has not joined the coalition.

Therefore, risks may obscure the envisaged fiscal adjustment, and macroeconomic performance could be adversely affected by slippages in program implementation. Specifically, failure to attain durable cuts in non-interest current expenditures, could undermine the credibility of the fiscal adjustment, thereby jeopardizing the implementation of the overall reform program.
