It will also help relieve the acute shortage of housing, begin the process of completing and divesting existing Government owned housing units, and demonstrate more cost-effective approaches to the provision of shelter for the urban poor. Given specific objectives of the project and its short 2-year duration, institutional development objectives should be limited to those critical to successful project implementation.  Specifically, the project includes infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance works in Accra, Tema, Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi; urban upgrading; housing consolidation; and sites and services.  Lastly, it provides support to the Technical Services Center of the Ministry of Works and Housing (MWH) and to the Ghana Highway Authority (GHA) for project preparation, monitoring and project preparation studies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"UH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban housing","code":"UH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926133556","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926133556","DocDate":"29-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120342376","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120342376","DocURL":"18-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120342678","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120342678","DocDate":"18-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120342477","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120342477","DocDate":"18-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120342075","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120342075","DocDate":"18-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120341874","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120341874","DocURL":"18-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120342075","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120342075","DocURL":"18-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120342477","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120342477","DocURL":"18-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120342678","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120342678","DocURL":"18-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120341874","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120341874","DocDate":"18-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e08240_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08240_1_0","DocDate":"26-JAN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e0823f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0823f_1_0","DocDate":"26-JAN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0823d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0823d_1_0","DocDate":"26-JAN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926133500","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926133500","DocDate":"17-DEC-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
