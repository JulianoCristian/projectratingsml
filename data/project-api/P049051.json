The project will: 1) support BEPEKA's efforts to remove existing audit scope limitations and other regulatory constraints and carry out full-fledged financial and performance audits; 2) promote user demand for such audits; 3) reduce internal supply constraints by upgrading technical and managerial skills; 4) build up the audit management information system; and 5) institutionalize international best practices.  The project consists of two major components.  The first one is strategic planning.  An international expert will be retained to (i) analyze sectoral and institutional issues; (ii) review existing and pending legal framework; (iii) increase demand for performance auditing; (iv) plan and conduct the first set of performance audits; and (v) assess other internal institutional factors critical to BEPEKA's long term sustainability.  The second component is institutional development, including: (i) skills development; (ii) audit management; and (iii) project management and implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"16,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"29,25,33","mjthemecode":"3,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050524094848","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050524094848","DocDate":"28-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172423","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172423","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040512265512","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040512265512","DocDate":"04-AUG-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980203115237","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980203115237","DocDate":"21-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
