This project has two main objectives : a) to reverse the decline in livestock numbers by dealing with the alarming animal epidemic disease situation; and b) to bring about improvements in the Ministry of Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAIF) which will lead to a smaller, more cost effective organization able to discharge its responsibilities to the livestock sector in an efficient, and effective manner.  Project components are the following : 1) a national animal disease control program; 2) tsetse fly control program in the Luwero, Mubende, Masindi and Hoima districts (areas not covered by other donors); 3) forage development through seed production and services covering about 7,500 milk producing farms, 12,000 ha of communal and ranch areas and 10,000 km of grass strips to protect terraced cultivation in the southwest; 4) credit and training to assist in the establishment of private veterinary practices; 5) institutional development, including technical assistance to help execute a program to streamline MAIF's organizational structure and reduce its staffing levels; and 6) project management support to MAIF in the areas of financial management and procurement."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":87},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"21,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"BC,AJ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83,78,25,79","mjthemecode":"10,2,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":87},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120582212","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120582212","DocURL":"07-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120582212","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120582212","DocDate":"07-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e085b9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e085b9_1_0","DocDate":"11-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929002754","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929002754","DocDate":"01-AUG-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
