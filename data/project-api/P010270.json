It will expand local, long-distance, and international telephone and telex networks, while increasing the management, organizational, and implementation capacity of T&T. This growth will be reinforced with a program of rehabilitation, replacement, and improved operations and maintenance.  In strengthening the telecommunications system, the project will address one of the chief bottlenecks to future economic and social development.  While business and government subscribers will benefit most from the improvement in long distance, nationwide dialling, international and telex facilities, the provision of new subsidiary routes, rural exchanges, and public call offices will benefit currently unserviced rural areas."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"CC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","code":"CC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019130407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019130407","DocDate":"26-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702140232","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702140232","DocDate":"30-JUN-1986"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
