The loan will help finance the costs associated with the Mexican Government's effort to monitor and control the A/H1N1 influenza epidemic, which originated in Mexico in March of this year and has occasioned more than 350 fatalities in the country. Given that epidemiologists expect a second wave of influenza to hit Mexico during the winter, the Mexican Government has requested Bank support in strengthening its capacity to monitor the spread of the virus (and influenza viruses more generally) and to control influenza epidemic waves. The project will assist Mexico in improving its National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE) including the upgrading of the Borrower's national reference laboratory for epidemiological surveillance, strengthening the infrastructure to effectively distribute medicines, vaccines and medical supplies and replenishing and expanding the country's strategic reserves thereof."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Public administration- Health","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"491,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Public administration- Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Paper,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BQ,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"64,67","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Public administration- Health","code":"BQ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":70},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022316252081","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022316252081","DocDate":"23-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2009122817040338","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009122817040338","DocDate":"30-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000350881_20091123102640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20091123102640","DocDate":"04-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20090723143451","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090723143451","DocDate":"17-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20090720100644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090720100644","DocDate":"14-JUL-2009"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
