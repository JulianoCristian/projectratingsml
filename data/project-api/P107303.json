As was the case with Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)-1, the PRSC-2 is being designed and implemented within a harmonized framework for the provision of budget support in Malawi. Such a framework exists under the leadership of the Government of Malawi (GoM) with five participating donors, including International Development Association (IDA).' It comprises of a joint framework, or memorandum of understanding, a multi-year Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), and a review process aimed at reducing transaction costs for all parties involved. The program document is divided into six sections, including this introduction. Section two discusses the country context which gives an overview of Malawi, recent economic developments including the impact of recent exogenous shocks, macroeconomic outlook, and debt sustainability. Section three presents the Government's program MGDS, section four discusses how the Bank is supporting the government program, while section five describes the second PRSC. Section six describes implementation issues, with a focus on risks and mitigating measures."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":53},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":13},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Petrochemicals and fertilizers","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Petrochemicals and fertilizers"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"BG,YD,AZ,YA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Economic management","Rule of law","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"25,34,21,27,75","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,2,1,3,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Petrochemicals and fertilizers","code":"YD"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":53},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":13},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":13},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":13},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012012915511621","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012012915511621","DocDate":"29-JAN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120123231200","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120123231200","DocDate":"17-JAN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010060416161866","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010060416161866","DocDate":"17-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20090508023958","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090508023958","DocDate":"24-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20080813161306","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080813161306","DocDate":"13-AUG-2008"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
