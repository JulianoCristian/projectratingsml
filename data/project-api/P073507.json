The primary development objective of this project will be to increase the efficiency of petroleum operations; of the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget (MOFEB) financial operations; and, of the Government's public enterprise reform, and privatization process. While the project's support to the three-year Interim Post-Conflict Program, and structural reforms, will improve transparency of decision-making in the government, and its agencies - prioritizing on the management of oil resources, and state budgetary expenditures - and, strengthen partnership, and dialogue among government, civil society, and the private sector, risks include the resurgence of political instability, particularly if the international community fails to support the peace process. Mitigation measures - outside the control of this project - include support to a comprehensive disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration program, through political dialogue, and willingness to implement reforms. The operation will contribute to minimize risks by strengthening capacity, and the dialogue and partnerships promoted through the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Congo!$!CG","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"7,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CG","sectorcode":"LC,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Human development"],"themecode":"88,43,27,40,30","mjthemecode":"2,4,2,4,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":80},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120124234257","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120124234257","DocDate":"30-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011050417402214","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011050417402214","DocDate":"04-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333038_20080616003859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080616003859","DocDate":"07-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333038_20080616002346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080616002346","DocDate":"07-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2008081116043354","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008081116043354","DocURL":"17-JUL-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2008081116043354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008081116043354","DocDate":"17-JUL-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201271282","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201271282","DocURL":"27-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201271282","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201271282","DocDate":"27-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_02012304015416","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02012304015416","DocDate":"08-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01060104463863","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060104463863","DocDate":"16-MAY-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Congo"}},"facets":{}}
