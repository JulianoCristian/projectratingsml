The purpose of the reallocation in the amount of SDR 75,338 to the 'operating costs' category from the 'refunding of project preparation advance' category is to supplement the operational budget of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) using the unutilized project preparation facility funds originally earmarked for Project management. These funds were not used as the start-up cost of the PIU was largely financed from the grant's 'operating costs' category. The reallocation is due to cost savings and considered a minor project change as per BPR 13.25."},"country_namecode":"Kyrgyz Republic!$!KG","sector1":{"Name":"Other
