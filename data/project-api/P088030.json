The extension is being requested to enable the completion of the main works under the project and to measure after completion the resulting improvements of the level of service. Principally the construction of three water treatment plants, which has experienced delays due to a combination of factors, namely initial delays in arranging the required subcontracting and liquidity issues from the main contractor, needs to be completed. Construction is now around 70 percent complete and is forecasted to be completed by September 2010 at the present rate of implementation progress. Project implementation was delayed by the termination of a contract for well drilling and another for transmission main setup. The new contract for well drilling to complete the remaining works is currently being negotiated for signature and is expected to be completed in four months. Six additional months following the completion of the works will be necessary to measure the improvements of the level of service in the project areas and evaluate the overall project achievement. The change is the extension of the closing date of the project by 12 months from its current closing date of March 31st, 2010, to March 31, 2011."},"country_namecode":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana!$!GY","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de consolidaci\u00f3n del sector de agua en Guyana (CRL) </ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"11,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Project Paper,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"GY","sectorcode":"WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance","Urban development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,71,25,52","mjthemecode":"6,2,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022619200383","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022619200383","DocDate":"26-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20100324235704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100324235704","DocDate":"19-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2006033009005803","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006033009005803","DocURL":"28-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000014464_2006033009005803","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2006033009005803","DocDate":"28-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000014464_2010042816211910","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010042816211910","DocDate":"28-OCT-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000012009_20050802124048","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050802124048","DocDate":"28-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000003596_20050729122949","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000003596_20050729122949","DocDate":"28-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20100324235455","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100324235455","DocDate":"28-JUL-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20050712121612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050712121612","DocDate":"30-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000310607_20060727151900","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20060727151900","DocDate":"01-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000310607_20060727150436","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20060727150436","DocDate":"01-JAN-2005"}],"countryname":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana"}},"facets":{}}
