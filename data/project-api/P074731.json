To this end, the project components will: 1) finance the revolving fund, to be used by the partner organizations (POs) of the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) for extension of micro-credit to the poorest. POs shall design the delivery of financial services for target groups within the broad parameters of PKSF, which will give range for setting interest rates to borrowers, savings requirements, maturity of loans, repayment period, and linkage with other safety nets. Additionally, training will be provided for income generating activities; 2) set, and operate the Financial Services for the Poorest Unit, and the Research Cell, whose incremental costs will be the responsibility of the monitoring and evaluation component, to be supported on a declining basis. Capacity building needs of POs will be supported, as will the acquisition of specific skills for income generating activities; 3) create a Disaster Fund, from disbursements by PKSF, to compensate losses beyond borrowers' control; and, 4) include a monitoring and evaluation system, to analyze performance indicators, and set the Research Cell of PKSF. A cost-benefit analysis will determine the achievement of project objectives."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":40},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"FE,FZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"41,44","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":60},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":40}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080730010219","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080730010219","DocDate":"16-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02022804022177","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022804022177","DocDate":"13-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02041804043244","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02041804043244","DocDate":"13-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02062804004520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02062804004520","DocDate":"01-JUN-2002"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
