The project is the first phase of the regional Program, covering Ethiopia, and Kenya, who have met the eligibility criteria for accessing funds under the MAP, developed comprehensive multi-sectoral strategic plans for the medium term, and endorsed the principle of public/private partnerships, to implement their national strategies, and assume overall program coordination. Each individual country project operation has their own specific development objectives, but provide the basis for this program. The program for Ethiopia will finance the Government's 2000-2004 HIV/AIDS strategic plan, that include support for capacity building within, both private, and government agencies. Prevention, care, and treatment activities will also be financed, to expand the public multi-sectoral response of civil society, and communities to the AIDS epidemic. The Kenya program will intensify the fight against AIDS, supporting five priority areas, that include prevention, and advocacy, treatment and support of the continuum care of AIDS affected people, management, and coordination, and mitigation of social impact, through research, monitoring, and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"59,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"JB,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,59,57,69,88","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,7,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":80},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20061113103004","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061113103004","DocDate":"27-OCT-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"005084918_2007110616262818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005084918_2007110616262818","DocDate":"12-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00082605465154","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082605465154","DocDate":"14-AUG-2000"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
