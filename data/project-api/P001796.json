The objective of the project is to undertake pilot activities to support decentralized rural economic recovery, while simultaneously creating the capacity and procedures necessary to respond to the challenges of post-war national reconstruction. The RRP has been designed to be flexible so it can respond to the changes likely to occur during the life of the project. The design of the management and implementation of the project benefited from the experiences of past projects in Mozambique. The project has four components. The Support for Decentralization Component includes a pilot activity to test procedures for identifying, funding, and implementing community-based investment subprojects.  The Lands Component will improve land use information and will support the development of policies to demarcate smallholder lands. The Distribution of Agpacks Component will provide seeds and hand tools to smallholders returning to their traditional lands after the war. The Rural Water Supply Component will increase the coverage of the rural water supply, improve the organization and management of provincial water supply institutions, and stimulate community participation in the operation and maintenance of the systems."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":27},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":24},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"BC,AZ,WC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,58,78,57,83","mjthemecode":"11,7,10,7,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":34},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":27},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":24},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01071204054822","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01071204054822","DocDate":"12-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121160536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121160536","DocDate":"30-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121160536","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121160536","DocURL":"30-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e122b4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e122b4_1_0","DocDate":"30-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003223634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003223634","DocDate":"25-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003223354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003223354","DocDate":"25-DEC-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique"}},"facets":{}}
