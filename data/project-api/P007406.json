By the academic year 1970/71 enrollment in secondary schools would comprise 45 percent of the students aged 12 to 14 instead of the present 10 percent; (2) the expansion of four teacher training colleges at a cost of US$1.1 million, which would increase the enrollment by 50 percent; (3) the expansion of the Jamaica School of Agriculture which produces agricultural experts through three years of training, at a cost of US$2.0 million. Student place would be trebled to meet the demand of the public services and the private sector; and (4) the expansion of the College of Arts, Science and Technology which produces senior-level technical personnel in engineering, science, pharmacy, commerce and institutional management. The cost would be US$1.3 million. There is great demand for personnel of this type and the project would increase enrollment in the school by 110 percent."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"JM","sectorcode":"ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901213552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901213552","DocDate":"04-MAR-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67d5c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67d5c_1_0","DocDate":"30-SEP-1966"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902561481","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902561481","DocDate":"30-SEP-1966"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903485649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903485649","DocDate":"30-SEP-1966"}],"countryname":"Jamaica"}},"facets":{}}
