The project will include power sector reform, investment and institutional development components as follows: 1) a time-bound implementation plan for power sector reform, including commercialization and incorporation of the power company; 2) Beilungang Phase 2 consisting of the addition of three 600-MW coal-fired units at the Beilungang Power Station; 3) transmission network expansion and reinforcement by the addition of about 400 circuit-km of 500 kV transmission lines and 2,250 of 500 kV substations; 4) reinforcement of distribution networks in Hangzhou and Ningbo Municipalities; 5) engineering and construction management services for Beilungang Phase 2; 6) technical assistance in preparing the security package for the Wangjiangmen cogeneration plant, which will be developed by a foreign/local joint venture; and 7) technical assistance to assist in commercialization, establish a computerized financial managment information system (FMIS), improve transmission and distribution planning, upgrade environmental monitoring, and support ZPEPC training program."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
