The components include: 1) school quality improvement, assuring minimum operational standards for schools, consisting of the following essential criteria: understanding of operational standards, and equity considerations, by both the school staff, and community; universal student access to basic textbooks, and, teachers' access to teaching guides; and, furnished classrooms, with at least the minimum equipment, and basic teaching material requirements; 2) expansion of educational access, to meet the growing demand for secondary education. This component, complementary of a federal loan that will finance the expansion of secondary education in several sates, will plan, and structurally reorganize the secondary school system, guaranteeing additional school places, through the rationalization of state, municipal, and private school resources. This micro-planning, a combination of school mapping, and geographic information systems, is a technical instrument to promote state/municipal cooperation for school locations; and, 3) increased school autonomy, by strengthening educational assessments, institutional educational management, and monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"69,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BC,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance","Rural development","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,78,25,65","mjthemecode":"8,2,10,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":40},{"Name":"Education","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20031211102638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20031211102638","DocDate":"05-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201473652","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201473652","DocURL":"12-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201473652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201473652","DocDate":"12-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201473551","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201473551","DocURL":"12-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201473551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201473551","DocDate":"12-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00121301483594","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121301483594","DocDate":"28-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911063353","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911063353","DocDate":"01-APR-2000"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
