The main project objectives are:  (i) to help meet the rapidly growing demand for wood; (ii) to reduce Burundi's need for imports of timber, timber substitutes and fuel; (iii) to contribute to protecting the natural environment; and (iv) to promote greater integration of cropping, forestry and livestock activities at the farm level.  Ninety rural nurseries (including about 30 new ones) would produce plants for sale to the population.  Agroforestry would be promoted to address the rural population's needs for wood, fodder, shade and soil improvement. Pilot actions would be undertaken in a few plantation areas to integrate afforestation with livestock and agricultural improvement activities.  About 3500 ha of eucalyptus and 1500 ha of pine plantations would be established in Western Burundi.  In addition 2000 ha of woodlots would be established in communes all over the country."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Burundi!$!BI","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BI","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006192109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006192109","DocDate":"17-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e061d8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e061d8_1_0","DocDate":"16-JUL-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094959","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094959","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101317","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101317","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Burundi"}},"facets":{}}
