The main benefits would be the restoration of services, through the rehabilitation of roads, bridges, flood control works, health centers, and schools. Despite its benefits, possible risks include: a) institutional overlap and lack of coordination in the Ambouli Oued rehabilitation project among government ministries, and donor agencies, but mitigation measures include expansion of the Djiboutian Agency for Implementation of Publics Works - ADETIP - through the steering committee to ensure government coordination among line ministries and agencies, and, coordination with th European Union (EU), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the African Development Bank (AfDB); b) minor relocation and resettlement risks as a result of the Oued rehabilitation project; mitigation includes that as a condition for the no-objection to proceed with the Oued rehabilitation component, the Bank requested that the protection dyke design and the widening/leveling of the Oued riverbed, avoid - to the maximum extent possible - the relocation of housing structures, and/or economic activities, and that a resettlement compensation plan be designed appropriately; c) the selling by flood victims of their lands and houses prompted the following mitigation measures: a rapid socio-economic study will be conducted to determine the extent of flood victims' willingness to remain in place, although the proximity to Port Doraleh, and its benefiting from several donor-financed projects, makes it a more viable, livable place. ADETIP will also ensure the integration of newly resettled families within existing socio-economic structures, and activities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Djibouti!$!DJ","sector1":{"Name":"Roads
