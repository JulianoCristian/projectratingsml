There are three project components. The first finances the costs related to the five-year management contract. These costs include a base fee and a performance-based fee to be paid to the Operator according to the achievement of targets defined in the contract. The Operator will be given full responsibility for managing the investment program; operating the water supply and sewerage systems; developing and implementing the demand management program, including a public awareness campaign; and implementing improved commercial (billing and collection) and financial management system. The second component, the Investment Fund, finances works, goods, and services aimed at improving the operation of the water supply and sanitation services, and achieving the performance targets in the management contract. The third component strengthens project implementation by supporting the Project Implementation Unit, including salaries, training, vehicles, and incremental operating costs; and various consulting services for supervision of the management contract and audits, studies, and field investigations related to the Project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AL","sectorcode":"WA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"70,71,39","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,9,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":80},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20100720031625","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100720031625","DocDate":"10-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123593123","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123593123","DocURL":"20-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123593627","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123593627","DocURL":"20-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123593526","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123593526","DocURL":"20-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123593425","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123593425","DocURL":"20-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123593224","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123593224","DocURL":"20-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0301300401371","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0301300401371","DocDate":"30-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02081004010290","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02081004010290","DocDate":"31-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02030704010887","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02030704010887","DocDate":"09-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02022804022174","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022804022174","DocDate":"08-OCT-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Albania","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
