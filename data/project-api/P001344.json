The project's specific objectives are to: 1) finance investments needed to meet power demand and improve the operational efficiency in the sub-sector; 2) reform the organizational structure of the power sub-sector to enable the operating entities to function efficiently and on a commercially sustainable basis; 3) create a legal and regulatory environment necessary for private sector participation in the supply of electricity; 4) support GoK's adoption of economic pricing of both electricity and petroleum products and implementation of demand and supply-side efficiency improvement measures; and 5) develop indigenous geothermal energy resources and a strategy for sustainable household and rural energy development. The project will consist of the following six components: (a) sector restructuring and reform; (b) other institutional support; (c) efficiency improvements; (d) power system expansion and upgrading; (e) geothermal resource development; and (f) future project preparation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":79},"sector2":{"Name":"Renewable
