In Vuelta Grande, all liquid hydrocarbons exist in gas form in the reservoir and appropriate reservoir pressure must be maintained in order to permit condensate production by recycling dry gas into the reservoir. The project would also provide studies of The Bolivian National Oil Company's (YPFB) staff policies and organizational efficiency as well as consultants services and training related to the recycling process."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"GS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","code":"GS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092615","DocDate":"30-JUN-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36801_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36801_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e367ff_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e367ff_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1986"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
