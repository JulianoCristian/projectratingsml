The project consists of: (a) a 65-meter earthfill dam with a volume of about 1.9 million cubic m, including a spillway with a 2,800 cubic m/sec discharge capacity, tunnels and underground penstock; (b) a 200 MW underground power station with three Francis turbines and three generators of 67 MW each; (c) a substation and 1 km of 230-kV transmission line to link with the San Carlos-Guatape line; and (d) studies to: (i) assist in determining actions necessary to ensure adequate environmental protection of the Playas reservoir; (ii) provide a least-cost plan for power rationing in the event of need; and (iii) determine the feasibility of EPM's acquiring the Electrificadoras of Antioquia and Choco, and to assess the works needed to bring their systems up to adequate standards. Tariff measures provided for under the project would continue to support the Government's objective of sound sector financing. Furthermore, the above mentioned study of the Electrificadoras would complement recent Government initiatives to strengthen sector organization and efficiency."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"85,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925064712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925064712","DocDate":"29-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97600_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97600_1_0","DocDate":"03-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e975ff_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975ff_1_0","DocDate":"03-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902365187","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902365187","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912523086","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912523086","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
