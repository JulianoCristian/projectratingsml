It will also improve the performance of the energy sector with an Energy Sector Plan covering policies, institutions and implementing mechanisms.  In addition it will ensure the financial viability of the National Power Corporation (NPC) to undertake a massive and long-overdue investment program and improve its institutional setup.  The project will have the following major components: (a) expansion of the transmission system in the Bataan/Batangas areas west of Metro Manila; (b) provision of goods and materials (conductors, insulators and supports) to reinforce the transmission system; (c) rehabilitation of the two units of the Bataan oil-fired thermal power plant; (d) consulting assistance to prepare a master plan to develop the 500 kV extra high voltage system and rehabilitate the Bataan thermal plant; and (e) improvement of NPC's institutional systems."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"110,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39","mjthemecode":"4,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122592166","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122592166","DocURL":"13-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122592065","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122592065","DocDate":"13-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122592065","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122592065","DocURL":"13-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122592267","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122592267","DocDate":"13-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122592267","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122592267","DocURL":"13-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122592166","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122592166","DocDate":"13-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003074512","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003074512","DocDate":"03-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003074645","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003074645","DocDate":"03-JUN-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
