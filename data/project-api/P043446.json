The PFMP will focus on the key initiatives of the Government's program of public financial management reform and will be organized into four components. The budget preparation component will assist in development and implementation of improvements for budget preparation, macroeconomic forecasting and preparation of forward estimation, and training staff for the revised budget system implementation.  The treasury operations component will introduce the Treasury Ledger System, develop effective cash management methodologies, and establish revised budget execution processes and a new treasury system.  Work under the debt management component will involve the development of improvements for the recording, reporting and issuance of government debt, and a training strategy for the implementation of the revised debt management system.  The public finance management information systems network will put in place policies, procedures and standards that will ensure coordination among efforts."},"country_namecode":"Hungary!$!HU","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"7,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"HU","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Economic management","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"42,27,21,23,30","mjthemecode":"2,1,1,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0301180408511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0301180408511","DocDate":"30-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182612","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200284379","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200284379","DocURL":"13-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200284379","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200284379","DocDate":"13-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3970311114830","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970311114830","DocDate":"08-NOV-1996"}],"countryname":"Hungary"}},"facets":{}}
