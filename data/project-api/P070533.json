Because the trust fund for East Timor does not have all the necessary project funding at this stage, project financing will be divided into two grants. The first grant finance priority activities to be carried out during the initial 12 months of the project. The components that will be financed under this grant include: a) priority productive asset restoration which will conduct national vaccination campaigns to immunize cattle, small ruminants, and pigs, etc; b) irrigation and rural infrastructure studies, rehabilitation, and maintenance, which will cover community rehabilitation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure and agriculture access roads, procurement of equipment, and feasibility and engineering studies to identify feasible irrigation improvements and selecting the schemes where rehabilitation would be most viable; and c) pilot agriculture services centers, to provide farming communities with farm inputs, mechanization services, etc;. The second grant will finance the remaining project activities which may have started during the first grant, but would need to continue until the project closes. Besides the second grant will also finance the establishment of a project management unit."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!$!TP","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":66},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"General information and communications sector","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"6,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General information and communications sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TP","sectorcode":"JB,BC,CZ,TA,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Human development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,78,68,79,76","mjthemecode":"10,10,8,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General information and communications sector","code":"CZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":66},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":15},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000310607_20060810115713","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20060810115713","DocDate":"27-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03041204014384","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03041204014384","DocDate":"25-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052615192161","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052615192161","DocDate":"21-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00082605420647","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082605420647","DocDate":"14-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00060105322290","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00060105322290","DocDate":"26-MAY-2000"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste"}},"facets":{}}
