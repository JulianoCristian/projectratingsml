This project has the following three components: Component 1) will finance on a grant basis, small-scale community works and services projects selected on a demand-driven basis with the active participation of community groups and local governments. The Community Infrastructure Sub-component will address the need for rehabilitation and construction of small-scale social and economic infrastructure at the local level through the financing of community investment micro-projects. The Community Social Services Sub-component will support community services programs targeted to address the needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in Kosovo with a view to promote inter-community integration by actively engaging citizens in the development process of their communities.
