New piped water supplies would also be provided to about 2,000 villages. These facilities would enable an additional 242 million liters of water per day (mld) to be supplied to the 2.4 million people in the four cities and provide about 1.7 million people in the 2,000 villages with improved water supplies by 1985. The project would also develop RWSSB as an institution capable of planning and implementing sectoral development programs in Rajasthan. The needs of the urban and rural poor would be met through water from standpipes supplied at a modest charge. Credit would also be provided on easy terms to facilitate sewer connections and basic plumbing installation by the economically weaker sections of society. The project faces risks of possible delays in implementation, and possible revenue shortfalls in rural areas on account of the untested cost recovery measures proposed. These risks are expected to be minimized through provision of consultant assistance, and a GOR undertaking to make up any shortfalls in revenue collection in rural areas."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000094946_99031910505170","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910505170","DocDate":"30-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925041743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925041743","DocDate":"27-SEP-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902354352","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902354352","DocDate":"30-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04209_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04209_1_0","DocDate":"19-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04207_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04207_1_0","DocDate":"19-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912490534","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912490534","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
