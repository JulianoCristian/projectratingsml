The additional financing for social mobilization enables key PPAF partner Organizations (POs) to expand their social mobilization programs to cover an additional one million poor rural households in 25 of the poorest districts of the country and provide a foundation for the expansion of Pakistan's poverty reduction agenda through PPAF and the PPAF-III project. PPAF's POs will mobilize approximately 50,000 Community Organizations (COs), which federate at union council levels, to form Local Support Organizations (LSO), and higher level in order to access public and private development resources and services and to link communities more effectively to local government and the private sector. A leadership cadre of 250,000 women and men will be trained to manage the COs and federations and to manage the linkages with outside organizations for long term sustainability. Restructuring of the additional financing in July 2009 introduced additional outcomes on community infrastructure and market linkages including, including the provision of 1,200 new infrastructure schemes and skills training for at least 1,000 individuals in the four districts of the Sindh Coastal Area Development (SCAD) program."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of
