The restructuring of the project, as described in this restructuring paper, will entail: 1) extension of closing date until December 15, 2014 for a cumulative extension of 23.5 months, 2) redefinition of selected activities for subcomponent 4.2; and 3) partial cancellation of the loan with respect to the original allocation for component three (DIAN). The changes are necessary to the achievement and sustainability of the Project Development Objective (PDO). The PDO continues to be achievable within the proposed extension, and would allow the Ministry of Finance to complete key activities already initiated, identified and agreed upon in the project procurement plan including the proposed activities. The extension will contribute to not only the full achievement of the PDO, but also to the sustainability of the final outcomes achieved under the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
