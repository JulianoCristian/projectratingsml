This includes completion of 15 MIPs already under construction in Orissa I, near-completion of three other MIPs, and appraisal as well as partial construction of six new MIPs. In addition, the project provides funds for some 160,000 ha of land to be consolidated into economic production areas. Within the same area, a system of watercourses and drains (defined as On-farm Development or OFD) are to be designed. On approximately 48,000 ha of consolidated land, the OFD works would be built during the project. To test improved MIP and canal system performance, a Research, Development and Training Cell is being established to undertake pilot studies. In addition, there are a number of coordinating units being established to insure that all State Government departments and research institutions are actively involved in the success of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"105,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925173559","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925173559","DocDate":"08-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05d96_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05d96_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUL-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05d94_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05d94_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUL-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101148","DocDate":"30-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810190102558","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190102558","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
