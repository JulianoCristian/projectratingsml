The development objectives would be country-specific and depend on the stage of the epidemic, income levels, and the socioeconomic status of those who are infected. The interventions chosen for each country project will be based on the countries' epidemiological and programmatic needs, and well-assessed options for meeting them, and include: 1) communication and advocacy to increase government commitment, attention, and funding related to HIV/AIDS and to raise awareness, knowledge, and understanding among the general population about HIV/AIDS; 2) scaling up prevention activities at the national and community levels; 3) scaling up care and support activities at the national and community levels; 4) supporting research and surveillance at the national level; and 5) capacity building. Separate, comprehensive PADs are included for Barbados and the Dominican Republic in this report."},"country_namecode":"Barbados!$!BB","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>VIH/SIDA I en el Caribe-Barbados</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":16},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"15,150,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"BB","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,59,88,67,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080826235305","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080826235305","DocDate":"27-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20060710102805","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060710102805","DocDate":"01-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01072704151672","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072704151672","DocDate":"19-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2010031615530647","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010031615530647","DocURL":"06-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2010031615530647","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010031615530647","DocDate":"06-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01061204004344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01061204004344","DocDate":"05-JUN-2001"}],"countryname":"Barbados"}},"facets":{}}
