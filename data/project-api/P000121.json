This requires the creation of an enabling environment for local contractors and consultants, for commercializing village-level operated and maintained (VLOM) pumps and spare parts through private networks and for promoting affordable solutions for on-site sanitation. The project comprises four components: a) water supply for rural communities in two regions; b) provision of VLOM pumps to cover the needs of all rural water supply projects in Benin; c) sanitation and hygiene education for rural communities in two regions; and d) capacity building. The project will cover the Atlantique and Zou regions."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"9,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"BH,JB,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,26,78","mjthemecode":"10,2,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":70},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01081804002781","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01081804002781","DocDate":"26-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121224987","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121224987","DocURL":"21-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121224987","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121224987","DocDate":"21-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121224786","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121224786","DocDate":"21-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121225288","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121225288","DocDate":"21-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121224786","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121224786","DocURL":"21-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121225288","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121225288","DocURL":"21-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b3bf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b3bf_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e1b3be_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b3be_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006055511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006055511","DocDate":"11-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006055205","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006055205","DocDate":"11-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin"}},"facets":{}}
