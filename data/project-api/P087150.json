The project has disbursed approximately 94 percent of the credit. While activities under the current credit are expected to continue as planned, an additional financing will be processed shortly. The closing date of the current project will be extended to align with the closing date of the additional financing. As such a restructuring of the current Development Credit Agreement (DCA) is required to reflect changes in outcome indicators and the new closing date. An extension of the current credit is recommended to ensure that there is adequate time for review and clearances required for the additional financing which has already been negotiated with the Government. It is possible that the clearance will come within the closing date of the current credit but the extension is required to ensure that there is adequate time provided to internal quality and review processes as required. This will be the second extension of the project."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Bhutan!$!BT","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":64},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and
