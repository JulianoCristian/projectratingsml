The restructuring consists of amending the loan agreement, the development credit agreement, and the development grant agreement to: (i) permit the financing of works under the project, some of which were not originally contemplated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), which consist of: (1) the construction of an orphanage under component one (civil society organization initiatives), (2) the renovation of an HIV/AIDS resource center at Ministry of Education under component two (scaling up HIV/AIDS response by line Ministries), (3) the upgrading of health facilities under component three (strengthening the health sector responses to HIV/AIDS), and (4) the renovation of the National AIDS Secretariat (NAS) building under component four (strengthening the institutional capacity for program management); and (ii) reallocate loan, credit and grant funds among disbursement categories of eligible expenditures to address the increase of project costs and future needs of the project."},"country_namecode":"St. Vincent and the Grenadines!$!VC","sector1":{"Name":"Central government
