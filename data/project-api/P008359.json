The project's main objectives are to:  (i) protect the area's water supply from contamination, thereby eliminating potential health hazards to the populace and preserving the important tourist industry; (ii) eliminate intermittent flooding that creates substantial repair and rehabilitation costs and interrupts industrial and commercial activity; and (iii) contribute to the further rationalization of the management of Cyprus' scarce water resources. The project consists of:  (i) a central sewage collection and treatment; (ii) upgrading the existing stormwater flood drainage system; (iii) provision for recycling of treated effluent for irrigation use; and (iv) training of SBLA staff."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cyprus!$!CY","sector1":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"16,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sewerage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CY","sectorcode":"WS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925203209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925203209","DocDate":"17-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99d0c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99d0c_1_0","DocDate":"08-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e99d0b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99d0b_1_0","DocDate":"08-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902441579","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902441579","DocDate":"30-APR-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cyprus"}},"facets":{}}
