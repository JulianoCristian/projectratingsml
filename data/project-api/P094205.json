IDA carried out a portfolio restructuring to release up to US$50 million and provisionally set aside US$25 million to provide immediate financing for urgent tsunami-related reconstruction efforts. This proposed follow-up operation for the Tsunami Emergency Recovery Operation, Phase II will continue the financing initiated under the Phase I restructuring. It is anticipated that other donors would be identified in the near future to support some of these priority needs. If other donors were to provide grant funds to finance any activity earmarked for support by IDA credits, IDA resources will not be used."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"75,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Housing construction"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"BZ,TA,YC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"52,61,71","mjthemecode":"9,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":55},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":35},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090809235548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090809235548","DocDate":"30-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000014464_2005082914074233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2005082914074233","DocDate":"01-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2005082914074233","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2005082914074233","DocURL":"01-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20050228155732","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050228155732","DocDate":"23-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000014464_2010042309041116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010042309041116","DocDate":"15-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000090341_20050216110825","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050216110825","DocDate":"14-FEB-2005"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
