The project will be a first phase of a national state roads program that could eventually cover most Nigerian states.  It will be executed in two states, Jigawa and Kano, and will include:  (1) road maintenance, rehabilitation and strengthening to reduce the backlog of rehabilitation and strengthening works on priority state roads; (2) road upgrading of selected high priority, high volume unsurfaced roads to appropriate design standards; (3) vehicles and equipment to strengthen institutional capacity to design and supervise the project work; and (4) institutional development to establish appropriate arrangements within the SMOWTs for planning, design, construction and maintenance, including the replacement of force account operations by private contracting for carrying out road maintenance and rehabilitation."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":89},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"68,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,25,74","mjthemecode":"9,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":89},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99060411065834","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99060411065834","DocDate":"15-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121125953","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121125953","DocDate":"11-NOV-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121125953","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121125953","DocURL":"11-NOV-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e12510_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e12510_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002210026","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002210026","DocDate":"29-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002205751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002205751","DocDate":"29-MAY-1992"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
