This will be achieved through the construction of two multipurpose berths suitable for servicing general cargo as well as container vessels and by improving the throughput of the existing berths by providing new cargo-handling equipment and by training of the port workers. As a result of worldwide economic recession, a decline in its international trade, and stagnation of external aid inflows, Bangladesh has experienced severe financial constraints over the past three years.

The credit, as a part of the Special Action Program, will provide supplemental financing for four ongoing projects to ensure that they are implemented in a timely manner without the government having to diversify resources from other high priority projects in its development program credit will increase IDA's share of project costs in two projects and finance a part of project cost overruns in the remaining two. The credit will also support the government's effort to address a number of administrative and procedural issues which hinder efficient project implementation.
