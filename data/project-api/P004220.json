Each settler family will be provided with 10 acres of planted oil palms and a house and lot. The main benefits expected from the project are the settlement of a sizeable number of largely landless families which should obtain an income several times the average prevailing in the rural sector, and the further diversification of Malaysia's agriculture and exports. Growing conditions for oil palms are particularly favorable in Malaysia, and the prospects for exports and prices are good."},"country_namecode":"Malaysia!$!MY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"14,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MY","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165718","DocDate":"23-DEC-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912404625","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912404625","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e67ae3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ae3_1_0","DocDate":"17-APR-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67ae1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ae1_1_0","DocDate":"17-APR-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903492713","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903492713","DocDate":"31-MAR-1968"}],"countryname":"Malaysia"}},"facets":{}}
