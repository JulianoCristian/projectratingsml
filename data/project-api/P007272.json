These sections represent the most urgent works, and comprise notably a critical section close to Port-au-Prince, the portion of the road that traverses the agricultural Plain of the Artibonite, as well as the northern section of the road (Plaisance-Cap Haitien). The project also includes the reconstruction of a major bridge over the Estere River, in the Artibonite Valley, which partially collapsed in 1973. The remaining sections of the road will be serviceable year round for another few years provided adequate maintenance is performed. (b) Technical Assistance: In order to achieve the above-mentioned objectives, technical assistance would be provided under the proposed project in the three general areas of transport planning, advisory services for the reorganization of TPTC, and local civil works contractors."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Haiti!$!HT","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"HT","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912501660","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912501660","DocDate":"27-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902221086","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902221086","DocDate":"31-MAY-1974"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912575839","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912575839","DocDate":"31-MAY-1974"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dec489_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dec489_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1974"}],"countryname":"Republic of Haiti"}},"facets":{}}
