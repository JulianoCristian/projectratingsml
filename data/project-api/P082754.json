The two components of this project are: (1) rehabilitation and/or upgrading of about 625 kilometers of rural roads, and (2) institutional development to: (a) develop monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of accessibility targets and execution of the Second National Program of Rural Roads (and roads improved outside this program) at the provincial and communal level, and disseminate the M&E information to further sectoral integration of rural development programs and strengthen local participation; (b) formulate recommendations for improving management of local rural roads to help the communes and provinces prepare to take over their maintenance; and (c) strengthen the capabilities of the Directorate of Roads for social and environmental assessments. This component will also include identification by the Provincial Directorates of Public Works (DPEs) together with specialized agencies, of local development opportunities stemming from improved accessibility, and assistance to the local communities."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"36,860,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Resettlement Plan","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development"],"themecode":"89,78","mjthemecode":"10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20120118223421","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120118223421","DocDate":"08-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011060814401913","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011060814401913","DocDate":"08-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010122610285376","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010122610285376","DocDate":"26-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20100617002138","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100617002138","DocDate":"09-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2005082913542046","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005082913542046","DocURL":"08-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2005082913542046","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005082913542046","DocDate":"08-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20040614164417","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040614164417","DocDate":"03-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20040527162346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040527162346","DocDate":"27-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20040526160716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040526160716","DocDate":"26-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000012009_20040506104436","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040506104436","DocDate":"01-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000012009_20040506123734","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040506123734","DocDate":"01-APR-2004"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
