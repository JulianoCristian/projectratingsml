ONAB would be better able to stabilize the meat prices which presently experience erratic fluctuations, and provide for the needs of its buyers, including factories, schools, hospitals, administrations, etc. The Project includes: (a) establishment of 12 sheep buying centers on the fringes of the Steppe on the High Plateau, and provision of vehicles for animal transportation; (b) cultivation of medic pastures and land now left fallow in rotation with cereals on 60,000 ha in 120 selected self-managed farms to be used for sheep fattening; (c) construction of 3 meat complexes, the largest being in Algiers and the two other in Oran and Annaba provinces; (d) technical and financial assistance to implement the scheme would be provided within a new ONAB division; the meat complexes would include a multi-species abattoir with parallel lines for cattle and sheep, a meat cutting plant with associated chilled storage, a meat products and a by-products plant, and storage capacity for frozen meat."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"42,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000333038_20081105045539","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081105045539","DocDate":"17-FEB-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902332583","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902332583","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e94b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e94b_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e94a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e94a_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000356161_20111116041051","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20111116041051","DocDate":"11-JUN-1979"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
