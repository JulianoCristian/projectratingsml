At the local level, the project aims to (i) implement the first priority investment package for the development of the Cheliff river basin; and (ii) to safeguard and improve farmers' income.  Secondly, at the sector level, the project intends to (i) develop and implement new institutional arrangements to ensure adequate water management, operation and maintenance in the Cheliff river basin and to (ii) develop and improve internal financing of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) by increasing user charges to fully cover costs.  Finally, at the national level, the project seeks to develop efficient irrigation potential in the country by expanding the large-scale irrigation areas presently used for irrigation by about 25 percent.  To accomplish these objectives at each level, the project consists of several components.  They involve:  (a) rehabilitation of existing irrigation infrastructure; (b) construction of new irrigation systems in Haut Cheliff; (c) provision for equipment and vehicles for extension and O&M staff; and (d) technical assistance.  Lastly, the project entails (e) training and recruitment; and (f) on-farm investments."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"94,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008064828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008064828","DocDate":"29-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926051328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926051328","DocDate":"17-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926051242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926051242","DocDate":"01-APR-1987"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
