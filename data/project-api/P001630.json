It will accomplish this by:  (i) developing policy instruments and incentives to encourage tree planting on a national basis; (ii) increasing fuelwood production through tree planting by small farmers and through establishing a limited number of Government plantations in ecologically fragile areas; and (iii) reducing fuelwood consumption by introducing more efficient charcoal kilns and household stoves.  The project will include components to support institutional development, wood production, wood conservation, and research and training.  Its most significant features are:  increases in fuelwood prices, expanded forestry extension and collection activities, provision of incentives for tree planting, and a redefinition of the Government's role in fuelwood production to emphasize the encouragement of private tree planting."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"16,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3961214164820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214164820","DocDate":"03-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094540","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094540","DocDate":"31-MAR-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165316","DocDate":"28-FEB-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
