There are four components. For the first component, new and rehabilitated and improved water supply facilities will be installed in communities, villages, and groups of villages of stated populations. The community participation approach will integrate the provision of safe drinking water, sanitation services, and health and hygiene education. The second component consists of making sanitation investments; constructing safe wastewater and excreta disposal systems; using appropriate technology; a hygiene education program; and providing public installations on a pilot basis, such as block latrines for schools, small sewer collectors, and community septic tanks, as well as lagoon-type wastewater treatment.  The participatory approach, component three, will include community mobilization and health education, carried out mainly by local personnel. The fourth component will help provide technical back-stopping, monitoring, and evaluation for the decentralized project implementation by enlisting the services of local and international consultants."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":84},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":7},"sector3":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"BC,WA,BH,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"70,59,57,78,84","mjthemecode":"11,10,7,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":84},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":6},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20030617084733","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030617084733","DocDate":"12-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200344025","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200344025","DocURL":"05-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200344126","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200344126","DocURL":"05-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000178830_98101912200639","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912200639","DocDate":"31-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172243","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
