The project will also include about 288 km of 400-kV transmission lines connecting Turceni with the city of Cluj to the north. The project will be a second stage extension to the first four 330-MW thermal power station at Turceni, which is now under construction in southwestern Romania. The basic fuel to be used will be lignite. The project will consume about 11 million tons of lignite p.a. at full operation starting in 1984-85, and will require the opening of new mines. Lignite production from existing known deposits will be capable of supplying this estimated consumption. Thus basic fuel supply is adequate and satisfactory arrangements to open the required new open cast and underground mines have been made. In addition to lignite, the Turceni station will also burn fuel oil for start-up and stabilization of lignite burning at partial load. The Government will furnish every six months lignite production data for the previous six-month period and production estimates for the next six-month period immediately following as was agreed for the first Turceni project."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"70,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925003120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925003120","DocDate":"26-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e403_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e403_1_0","DocDate":"11-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e402_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e402_1_0","DocDate":"11-JAN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902320617","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902320617","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912421235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912421235","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
