Specific objectives are to : a) strengthen SLT's capabilities in the areas of corporate planning, financial management, network planning and engineering; b) facilitate private sector participation; and c) connect 50,000 new subscribers to meet 80% of demand in project areas by 1995. Project components include the expansion of switching capacity in Colombo and the rehabilitation of some of the existing exchanges and local networks in seven provincial regions, improvement of the telegraph service, and technical assistance as follows : 1) in Colombo expand switching capacity by about 35,000 lines; 2) in the provinces provide seven parent exchanges as well as remote units and 17,000 lines; 3) improve the existing telegraph service by installing a store-and-forward message unit in SLT's premises in Colombo, which will serve up to 120 video-display (VDU) terminals and will be connected to the telex exchange by a 2Mb/s digital link."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"57,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"BC,YW,CT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Rural development"],"themecode":"77,71,39","mjthemecode":"4,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":86},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99030406253794","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99030406253794","DocDate":"23-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123283865","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283865","DocURL":"15-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123283966","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283966","DocDate":"15-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123283865","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283865","DocDate":"15-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123283966","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283966","DocURL":"15-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e392a4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e392a4_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e392a2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e392a2_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960930090715","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930090715","DocDate":"26-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930090442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930090442","DocDate":"26-APR-1991"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
