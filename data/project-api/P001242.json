The project comprises: (a) improvement of the Nairobi-International Airport road (14 km) to dual carriageway standard; (b) construction or improvement of seven roads (totalling 315 km) serving rich agricultural areas; (c) construction or improvement of 388 km of roads of varying standards required for the Mumias Sugar Development Scheme; and (d) technical assistance for transport planning and coordination. The main economic benefits of the project would take the form of lower vehicle operating costs, user time savings and the increased rate of agriculture development induced by the improved infrastructure. The estimated economic rate of return on the project as a whole is about 20 per cent."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"29,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901032975","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901032975","DocDate":"03-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b7b6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b7b6_1_0","DocDate":"14-AUG-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b7b5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b7b5_1_0","DocDate":"14-AUG-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6aa86_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6aa86_1_0","DocDate":"14-AUG-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902203628","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902203628","DocDate":"31-JUL-1973"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
