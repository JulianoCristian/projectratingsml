The GPRS II emphasizes the centrality of private-led growth to reduce poverty, along with human development and governance efforts to promote equity. While EGPRC will translate primarily into funding for the GPRS II implementation, particular attention is given to: (i) restoring budgetary discipline; and (ii) tackling long-standing public sector and energy issues. The Development Policy Operation (DPO) is part of a program of support to Ghana during FY09 that currently implies a 27 percent front-loading of International Development Association (IDA) assistance. This operation will be complemented by a sector (natural resources) development policy operation (US$l0 million), and two investment projects in transport (US$225 million) and rural water (US$15 million). Other operations being prepared for FY10 include an International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) enclave for the gas sector, a sector development policy operation (agriculture), support for the development of safety nets, a project in support of the water and sanitation sectors, and a joint initiative with partners to support public sector reforms and capacity development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":66},"sector2":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":32},"theme5":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"JB,LZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Economic management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"25,27,21,77,54","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,10,1,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":66},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":17},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20111025012944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20111025012944","DocDate":"22-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2009122316345786","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009122316345786","DocDate":"15-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2009122316345786","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009122316345786","DocURL":"15-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20090617235129","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090617235129","DocDate":"15-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000112742_20090621232300","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20090621232300","DocDate":"05-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000013944_20090406123116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000013944_20090406123116","DocDate":"04-MAR-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
