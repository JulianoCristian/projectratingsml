The main components are: (a) public sector investments in agricultural extension, export promotion, research, and physical infrastructure to support private tree crop smallholder development, private horticulture production and export, and private milling; (b) private sector investments in oil palm, coffee, rubber and pineapple cultivation and palm oil milling; and (c) support activities for public and private institutions involved.  The oil palm program involves planting and establishment of intermediate technology small-scale palm oil mills; coffee extension and improved planting stock supply activities will lead to planting/replanting and rehabilitation of robusta coffee; and the rubber program will lead to the planting of 1,200 ha by outgrower smallholders.  Improved technology, infrastructure and export marketing assistance will increase pineapple exports and the research and technology improvement components will support coffee research, and pineapple and rubber technology.  Support activities will strengthen technical expertise, managerial competence and supervisory capacity in the public sector and provide access to export marketing expertise in the private sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
