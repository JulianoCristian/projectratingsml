This is a level two restructuring as it only covers a slight modification in project design in executing agencies, there is no change in the Project Development objective (PDO) and the outcome indicators are the same. The changes are intended to define the implementation arrangement of the second year of the FTI grant. For the second year, these revised implementation modalities will be used to ensure a timely delivery of the project. The total grant is $81.5 million of which $35 million was allocated for the first phase in 2010 and the remaining for the second phase in 2011. The project was effective on September 24, 2009. So far, after one year of implementation, $9 million representing 11 percent of the total amount are disbursed into the designated account. The delivery of the program of the first tranche that was planned for December 2010 would likely be achieved with an additional delay of two months. In a letter dated March 30, 2010, the Government has requested the Bank to revise the grant agreement to diversify the implementation modalities to ensure that the project will be fully delivered on time by December 2011."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Public administration-
