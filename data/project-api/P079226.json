The project consists of three components.  The first, the Secondary Education Grants Program will provide grants to schools to: (a) facilitate the development and implementation of broad based curricular programs and technical and professional curricular families for secondary education, and (b) enable certain schools to expand so that students are able to study revised four year programs or attend general education.  The second, education finance and management, will facilitate the design and implementation of more transparent formula-based financing mechanisms for publicly-provided general education.  The third, project implementation, will provide consulting services and training to support project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BA","sectorcode":"ES,BC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"65,66","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000334955_20090702054506","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090702054506","DocDate":"15-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"006913457_2007061910441057","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006913457_2007061910441057","DocURL":"12-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000021321_2010042310501189","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010042310501189","DocDate":"12-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000021321_2010042310485378","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010042310485378","DocDate":"12-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"006913457_2007061910441057","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006913457_2007061910441057","DocDate":"12-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000112742_20050527100840","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050527100840","DocDate":"18-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20050509091540","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050509091540","DocDate":"05-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03022704113181","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03022704113181","DocDate":"03-FEB-2003"}],"countryname":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}},"facets":{}}
