The project has three components. The first facilitates sector reforms and key actions by defining basic specialties in regional hospitals, which are enabled to use available resources more effectively; and redefines central and regional authority functions and powers; and links these entities with health care providers in the public and private sectors. The second upgrades regional hospitals to improve their function of initial referral and their provision of specialized care for their communities; strengthens national medical emergency services; and develops and implements the national health information system. The third improves the capacity of the health ministry for planning, policy analysis, and financial management; and assists in establishing national health accounts and in improving the ministry's reporting and financial management system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"67","mjthemecode":"8,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060406091932","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060406091932","DocDate":"29-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040701145638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040701145638","DocDate":"24-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123153096","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123153096","DocURL":"20-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123153096","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123153096","DocDate":"20-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980319100004","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980319100004","DocDate":"13-FEB-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929095118","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929095118","DocDate":"20-NOV-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
