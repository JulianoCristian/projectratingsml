There are two main project components. The first component finances technical assistance and training for activities associated with information sharing, mobilization and screening of interest, pre-investments, ex-ante evaluation of detailed productive partnership sub-project proposals, and studies. The second component supports the implementation of productive partnerships by financing 1) cost sharing transfers as a financial incentive for participating small farmers producer organizations; and 2) technical assistance and training to productive partnership participants. The third component, project management, includes the operation of a management information system, and the design and implementation of monitoring, evaluation, and learning arrangements."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de apoyo para asociaciones productivas</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":44},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":44},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"BC,AZ,YB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"51,79,44,62,84","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,7,4,10,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":44},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":44},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090814002039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090814002039","DocDate":"14-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200465239","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200465239","DocURL":"03-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052110490751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052110490751","DocDate":"03-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200465742","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200465742","DocURL":"03-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02010711085126","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02010711085126","DocDate":"14-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9912220532386","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9912220532386","DocDate":"30-MAY-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
