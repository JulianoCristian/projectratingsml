The Phasom Dam is to be a concrete structure about 100 meters high and 800 meters long. The project also includes the construction of five saddle dams, up to 35 meters high, and built of compacted earth; and the construction - which has been completed - of an airfield, two access roads including bridges, and campsite facilities for use during and after construction work on the dam. Studies to be prepared by consultants or experts relate to the timing and size of the power generating facilities to be installed at the dam and to be included in the Yanhee Electricity Authority system, a feasibility study of irrigation schemes in the Nan River Valley and the formulation of an agricultural development program for the rapid introduction of second cropping in the northern part of the Chao Phya area."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"26,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912485719","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912485719","DocDate":"14-FEB-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67dec_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67dec_1_0","DocDate":"19-SEP-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903004736","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903004736","DocDate":"30-JUN-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903490056","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903490056","DocDate":"30-JUN-1967"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
