The changes will reallocate the savings from the cancelled $2.1 million procurement of Avian Influenza vaccines to provide laboratory equipments for a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) laboratory facility at the ministry of agriculture. Savings from cancelled procurement of vaccination equipment and from other completed contracts add up to additional savings of about $1.1 million. It is that the additional savings will be used to procure motorcycles and information technology equipment (laptop computers, internet connection, faxes) for the benefit of local veterinary clinics to enhance their capacity for disease management, surveillance, and reporting."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"7,140,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"BZ,AJ,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000360631","geoLocName":"Muhafazat al Qahirah","latitude":"30.049999","longitude":"31.65","country":"EG"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,78","mjthemecode":"10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":40},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20120725003043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120725003043","DocDate":"26-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011012414374033","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011012414374033","DocDate":"24-JAN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20100629001156","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100629001156","DocDate":"24-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20100629000117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100629000117","DocDate":"23-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20070910143241","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20070910143241","DocDate":"22-AUG-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20070823092850","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20070823092850","DocDate":"20-AUG-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20070823092639","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20070823092639","DocDate":"18-JUL-2007"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
