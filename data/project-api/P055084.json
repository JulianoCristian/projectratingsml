The Competitiveness Project aims to advance the Program's objective as well as those of the nation's Peace Accords by helping primarily small and micro businesses to generate higher incomes and reduce high rates of poverty in Guatemala. There are five main project components. The first increases domestic market competition by adopting laws and regulations, establishing the functional capacity of the Competition Commission, acquiring public support for competition policy, and completing an investigation of competitiveness. The second component accelerates foreign investment by providing full investor services. The third component expands in-firm skills training and information markets. The fourth component upgrades firm product and process quality by establishing a training system, and setting up government agencies with accredited labs or certification programs. The fifth component increases firm investments in learning and innovation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guatemala!$!GT","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de Competitividad </ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"20,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Agreement,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GT","sectorcode":"BG,FE,BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Economic management","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,22,41,45,44","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,5,4,1,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","code":"22"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":42},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":31},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2010100512301036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010100512301036","DocDate":"25-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100111230612","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100111230612","DocDate":"23-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201543656","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201543656","DocURL":"23-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052411511919","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052411511919","DocDate":"23-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0012010530355","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0012010530355","DocDate":"20-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000012009_20040422102840","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040422102840","DocDate":"14-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00032306412673","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00032306412673","DocDate":"14-MAR-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guatemala","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
