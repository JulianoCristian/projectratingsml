The project comprises two main components.  The policy and strategy component consists of several studies, audits, and advisory services to help design and implement a new policy and strategy for the mining sector.  The studies will cover the legislative, economic, fiscal, institutional, artisanal, and environmental aspects of the mining sector.  Implementation of the strategy will involve restructuring the institutional framework of the sector, revising relevant legislation and procedures, and closing and/or selling public enterprises and their holdings in the sector to private investors.  The investment promotion component will consist of financing consulting services, equipment, and some works to:  (a) organize the documentation center's information and rehabilitate its facilities; (b) synthesize existing geological data and improve the geological information system; (c) fill the gaps in the geochemical data coverage of prospective mining areas of the country; and (d) promote specific mineralized areas to potential investors."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"33,44,25,43","mjthemecode":"4,2,4,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0001130530316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0001130530316","DocDate":"28-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121115629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121115629","DocDate":"24-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121115629","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121115629","DocURL":"24-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e3956f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3956f_1_0","DocDate":"17-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003005512","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003005512","DocDate":"18-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003005350","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003005350","DocDate":"18-MAY-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
