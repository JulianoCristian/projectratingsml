Its objective is to assist in the development of indigenous energy resources, thereby reducing Yugoslavia's dependence on imported energy. The project comprises support for a time slice of the gas exploration programs for INA-Naftaplin, Nafta-Gas and EXPL through: (i) the expansion of exploration activities to the more complex and deeper areas that hold the potential for increasing the country's future recoverable reserves of hydrocarbons; (ii) the acceleration of exploration activity in Yugoslavia by promoting to international petroleum companies exploration areas that are prospective but are insufficiently explored due to the inadequate resources of the local companies; (iii) the strengthening of the technical capabilities of Yugoslav petroleum companies to develop gas reserves under high pressure and temperature, and containing corrosive gases; and (iv) the introduction of an underground gas storage system to reduce problems related to seasonal demand for gas."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"92,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Note on Cancelled Operation,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"GI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","code":"GI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3970619110843","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970619110843","DocDate":"20-FEB-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145454","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145454","DocDate":"20-FEB-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095008","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095008","DocDate":"30-JUN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970723103426","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970723103426","DocDate":"30-JUN-1985"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
