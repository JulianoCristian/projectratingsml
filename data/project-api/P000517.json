The central project objective is to improve the access, quality and efficiency of primary education, primarily in rural areas and nationwide for girls.  To this end, the project will support a national development program for primary education designed to achieve the following targets for 1998:  raising overall primary enrollment ratio from 59% in 1990 to 65% and the share of female enrollment from 31% to 36%, and reducing the average repetition rate from 30% to 20%.  Secondary objectives are to promote a more efficient resource use in the education sector.  To achieve these objectives and to help finance recurrent costs entailed by project investments, the project will support policy measures to:  (a) increase public expenditures on primary education; (b) increase efficiency in the use of primary school teachers and classrooms; (c) promote girls' participation in primary education; and (d) encourage private initiatives in the provision of education.  Within the framework of the policy measures, the project will finance investments designed to:  (i) improve the access and quality of primary education nationwide; (ii) support a pilot school improvement program for primary education in three regions; and (iii) strengthen critical sectoral institutions."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"19,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TD","sectorcode":"JB,ET,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"59,61,65,57,78","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,7,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":78},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02062504004981","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02062504004981","DocDate":"11-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121170561","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121170561","DocDate":"21-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121170561","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121170561","DocURL":"21-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e125b5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e125b5_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004072328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004072328","DocDate":"16-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004072523","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004072523","DocDate":"16-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333037_20100504020840","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100504020840","DocDate":"16-APR-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chad","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
