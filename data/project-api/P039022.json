The project objective is to test and fine-tune the set of institutional, technical, financial and economic rules through which the national policies can be translated to concrete measures that ensure better quality water supply and sanitation services in hundreds of small towns in the Philippines. The six components are: 1) financing of civil works, equipment and supervision; 2) financing of a sanitation program; 3) financing investments in an urban drainage program; 4) creation of the water utilities private sector participation facility; 5) support new projects through a revolving fund; and 6) technical assistance for institutional capacity building. The loan will be channeled through the Development Bank of the Philippines."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":6},"sector3":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"23,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Flood protection"}],"docty":"Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"WD,WA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"72,74,84,73,44","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,9,11,9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":91},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":6},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200401156","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200401156","DocURL":"29-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200401156","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200401156","DocDate":"29-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200401257","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200401257","DocDate":"29-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200401257","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200401257","DocURL":"29-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173123","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173123","DocDate":"30-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910513977","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910513977","DocDate":"01-NOV-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
