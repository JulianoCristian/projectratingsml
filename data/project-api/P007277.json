On completion, the project would provide physical facilities for about 19,500 primary school students and would improve the quality of primary education for more than 300,000 children in grades 1-4 in public schools. A UNDP grant of about US$0.5 million would help finance part of the technical assistance component. Project risks concerning financing of recurrent costs generated by the project would be minimized by proposed assurances providing for the allocation of sufficient funds for maintenance and operating costs, adoption of improved conditions of teacher service and reforms in the fiscal sector. Improved conditions of teacher service would help to attract and retain qualified teachers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Haiti!$!HT","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Agreement","countrycode":"HT","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924202723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924202723","DocDate":"17-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902294570","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902294570","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912335178","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912335178","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b91_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b91_1_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Haiti"}},"facets":{}}
