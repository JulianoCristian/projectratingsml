There are four project components. The first 1) helps improve essential infrastructure for inter- and intra-university information technology networks, management information systems, modern library systems, and faculty training; and 2) supports the Higher Education Development Fund (HEDF), which allocates investment funding for university-based academic and entrepreneurial sub-projects, information technology, proposals, and faculty development centers. The second component improves governance by supporting the Higher Education Council's Secretariat, the Higher Education Accreditation Council; and university management and planning. The third component helps reform the community college system by developing new programs and human resources, and upgrading facility and equipment. The fourth component supports project implementation capacity by funding staffing and equipment."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"34,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"JO","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"66","mjthemecode":"8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080411020133","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080411020133","DocDate":"26-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00021805432862","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00021805432862","DocDate":"01-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00031505341735","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00031505341735","DocDate":"24-JAN-2000"}],"countryname":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan"}},"facets":{}}
