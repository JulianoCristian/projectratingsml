The project would support the initiation of a national vocational training program to meet the training needs of the export-oriented industrial sector, assist the Government and the private sector in selecting appropriate technologies and in improving and expanding quality control services for exports. The project would include construction of training/administrative buildings for the Vocational Training Council (COCAP), laboratories for LATU, and provision of equipment and furniture, as well as technical assistance.
