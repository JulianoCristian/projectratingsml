Its principal objectives are to: a) promote private sector growth and create conditions for an effective supply response from viable private enterprises and farmers; b) facilitate the banking sector transformation and integration into international financial markets; and c) stimulate credit market competition. At the level of individual banks, the project aims to provide hands-on-assistance for institutional strengthening and the adoption of safe and sound banking practices. The project will contribute to reversing the country's economy decline and to increase the private sector share in the economy. The project consists of a single private enterprise finance component, consisting of a credit line to be intermediated by a number of participating financial intermediaries (PFI). Six PFIs have been already qualified under the PSD 1 and an additional three banks are expected to be able to meet qualification criteria in the near future. The subloans under the credit line will be extended for investment and working capital finance of eligible private enterprises for eligible subprojects."},"country_namecode":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of!$!MK","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"MK","sectorcode":"AZ,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,44,41","mjthemecode":"4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":75},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030708110002","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030708110002","DocDate":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200340500","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200340500","DocURL":"19-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200340601","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200340601","DocURL":"19-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171124","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171124","DocDate":"02-OCT-1997"}],"countryname":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of"}},"facets":{}}
