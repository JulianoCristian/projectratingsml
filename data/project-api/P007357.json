The project comprises: (1) a line of credit for investments in crops, livestock, agricultural machinery and municipal abattoirs; (2) flood control and drainage works for banana and plantain development; (3) a pilot reforestation program; (4) studies of groundwater resources, COHBANA's organization, and use or waste bananas and plantains for animal feed; and (5) incremental PU expenditures and related training and technical assistance. Almost 90 percent of the expected 12,800 persons who would benefit directly from the project have present incomes which fall beneath the rural poverty line; the project would help raise their annual incomes substantially."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000334955_20090130065844","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090130065844","DocDate":"17-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e96178_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96178_1_0","DocDate":"17-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96176_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96176_1_0","DocDate":"17-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04195_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04195_1_0","DocDate":"17-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04193_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04193_1_0","DocDate":"17-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912474074","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912474074","DocDate":"31-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902345569","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902345569","DocDate":"31-MAR-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras"}},"facets":{}}
