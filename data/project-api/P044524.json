A second objective is to help build capacity for planning and implementation of education programs at the state, entity, canton, and municipality level. To achieve these objectives under the prevailing constraints, the project focuses on meeting immediate educational needs in primary schooling which can, for the most part, be put in place prior to the start of the next school year in September, 1996. The components of the project are the following: 1) primary school reconstruction; 2) books and educational materials; 3) project implementation and capacity building; and 4) project preparation and pilot implementation in the Republica Srpska. They include civil works, provision of furniture and equipment and technical assistance and training."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"BA","sectorcode":"BH,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"65,58,73","mjthemecode":"9,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_9903040625476","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903040625476","DocDate":"29-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2010022514330789","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022514330789","DocURL":"22-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022514330789","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022514330789","DocDate":"22-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051215434148","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051215434148","DocDate":"22-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961019214818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019214818","DocDate":"22-APR-1996"}],"countryname":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}},"facets":{}}
