The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is aligned to the SEDP. Better planning processes, more transparent procurement and stronger public financial management, all areas covered by the program, fall under the modern governance pillar of SEDP. The program is designed to assist the government of Vietnam to strengthen the selection, preparation, implementation and supervision of public investment projects. While much progress has been made over the last decade in the upgrading of public financial management in relation to recurrent expenditures, there are still important weaknesses in the management of investment projects. Those weaknesses take a toll on economic efficiency in a country where total investment accounted for 41.3 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2008, and consolidated public sector investment for 12.6 percent. An increased focus on the quality of growth, in addition to its quantity, is warranted. The recent international macroeconomic turbulence has dramatically exposed the weaknesses of public investment in Vietnam. Distorted price signals resulted in capital expenditures going to sectors experiencing asset price bubbles, thus amplifying macroeconomic fluctuations. Insufficiently developed monitoring mechanisms also made it difficult for the government to adjust investment volumes so that they will play a more counter-cyclical role."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":12},"theme2":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":44},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"500,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,27,29,83","mjthemecode":"11,2,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20120726014325","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120726014325","DocDate":"26-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010081315452978","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010081315452978","DocDate":"30-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20091130233626","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091130233626","DocDate":"19-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20091123090521","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20091123090521","DocDate":"28-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000101930_20091001160631","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000101930_20091001160631","DocDate":"02-SEP-2009"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}},"facets":{}}
