To this end, the project will include:  (a) replacement of deep wells and provision of pumping equipment, and construction of piped water distribution systems.  It will also provide for; (b) orchard and crop reconversion and intensification; and (c) provision of equipment and staff to the executing agency, the Gabes and Medenine Irrigation Development Office (OMVGM).  Finally, the project will involve; (d) provision of technical assistance to OMVGM and to existing farmer associations; as well as (e) provision of credit to farmers for onfarm development.  The project will directly benefit about 7700 farm families, among the poorest in Tunisia.  The risk related to slow adoption by farmers of new cropping patterns is minimized by the provision of suitable extension services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"27,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008034225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008034225","DocDate":"04-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095026","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095026","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970723103630","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970723103630","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
