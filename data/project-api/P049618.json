The three main project components will: 1) support the operationalization, and strengthening of a new autonomous asset holding entity - Nairobi Water Services Board (NWSB) - and, a new autonomous and ring-fenced water, and sewerage service provision company for Nairobi - Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NWSC). The new institutions will be appropriately strengthened to ensure professional management, and commercial operations; 2) support selected activities aimed at strengthening the commercial, financial, and technical operations of NWSC. The focus will however be on strengthening the commercial operation of the six area/business centers. Some tangible service improvements to consumers are expected, and, specific service improvement targets will be set for the new institutions for the duration of the Project; and, 3) support monitoring of project activities, implementation of a complementary communication program in support of the new institutional transformation in services provision. In particular, the progress and interim results emanating from the Project would be communicated to the public, and these would be discussed, debated, and, feedback obtained. This component will also support the preparation of follow-on investment programs in Nairobi, Mombasa, and possibly other urban centers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Project Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"74","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"9,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080911001444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080911001444","DocDate":"27-AUG-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.7","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20050615170034","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050615170034","DocDate":"01-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.6","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20050615165320","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050615165320","DocDate":"01-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.5","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20050615165017","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050615165017","DocDate":"01-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.4","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20050615164718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050615164718","DocDate":"01-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.3","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20050615164217","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050615164217","DocDate":"01-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20050615162829","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050615162829","DocDate":"18-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.2","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20050615163638","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050615163638","DocDate":"18-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000014464_2010043015081197","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010043015081197","DocDate":"25-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000014464_2010042909002320","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010042909002320","DocDate":"25-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000014464_2010043015093698","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010043015093698","DocDate":"25-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20040527130710","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040527130710","DocDate":"07-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000012009_20040324111018","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040324111018","DocDate":"10-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20040510094407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040510094407","DocDate":"28-JAN-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
