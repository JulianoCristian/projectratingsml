This will be achieved through the establishment of a network of the regional Assessment Institute for Agricultural Technology (AIATS), improvement of regional research management, expansion of research in priority areas, and strengthened linkages to local, national, and international institutions, thereby facilitating the delivery of research results to end-users. Specific project outcomes for successfully meeting these objectives are included in the Project Implementation Plan. The project will consist of the following four components: (a) regionalization of agricultural R&D; (b) institutionalization of R&D management at the regional level; (c) support of priority commodity and discipline-oriented research; and (d) strengthen R&D collaboration."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"63,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BH,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"26,79","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":75},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000020953_20070813093854","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070813093854","DocDate":"01-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20030709103221","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030709103221","DocDate":"26-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123074194","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123074194","DocURL":"16-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123074395","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123074395","DocURL":"16-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123074194","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123074194","DocDate":"16-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123074395","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123074395","DocDate":"16-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3c2c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3c2c_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214184534","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214184534","DocDate":"21-APR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
