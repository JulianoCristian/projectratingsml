The project would include: the expansion of the existing steam power plant at ASHUGANJ through the addition of two new steam gas-fired units of 150 MW each, including boilers and ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment; the construction of a 230 kV double circuit 48 km transmission line between Ashuganj and Ghorasal, including a 230/132 kV substation; and the financing of a simulator to train BPDB's staff in the operation of steam power plants."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"92,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05b13_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05b13_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05b11_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05b11_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902395481","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902395481","DocDate":"31-MAY-1982"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
