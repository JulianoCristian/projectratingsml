The credit will finance the environmental assessment, and the final design and preparation of bidding documents which are required for the future Ouagadougou Water Supply Project.  In addition, the credit will strengthen ONEA's capacity to prepare and manage such a large investment through the provision of office space and equipment and technical assistance, training and the purchase of equipment and vehicles.
