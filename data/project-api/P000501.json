The specific objectives of the project are to: 1) reshape extension into an effective service addressing farmer's needs for improved crop and livestock production as well as for natural resources management; 2) strengthen linkages between extension and research focusing on participatory and adaptive research; and 3) strengthen and build up producer's organizations. The components of the project are as follows: 1) extension service activities which will progressively cover the country's fourteen \"prefectures\", for crop and livestock production, and natural resource management; 2) the establishment of a minimum research capacity, through collaboration among researchers, producers and extension agents, to develop, test and promote improved production practices and technologies; and 3) the enhancement of the capacity of producers' organizations, through training and technical assistance, to carry out group activities such as crop and produce marketing, management and distribution of farm inputs, maintenance of agricultural equipment and basic animal health care."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"24,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TD","sectorcode":"YA,BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Rural development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48,79,77,57","mjthemecode":"7,10,10,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03042204022284","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03042204022284","DocDate":"07-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121252531","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121252531","DocURL":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121252531","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121252531","DocDate":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b48a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b48a_1_0","DocDate":"14-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007195306","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007195306","DocDate":"17-FEB-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chad"}},"facets":{}}
