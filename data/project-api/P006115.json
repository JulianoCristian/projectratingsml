Gas del Estado is obligated to purchase at a fixed price in U.S. dollars, 141 million cubic feet per day for the first 7 years and 159 million cubic feet for the following 13 years. To transport the gas to Argentina, a 24-inch pipeline, 329 miles in length, will be built from the Santa Cruz region in eastern Bolivia, where the principal gas fields are located, to the border at Yacuiba. Gas del Estado will build a short connection on the Argentine side of the border to link the new pipeline with its existing pipeline to Buenos Aires. The project includes, in addition, the construction of a 12-3/4-inch lateral pipeline, 89 miles long, to connect YPFB's Monteagudo field in southern Bolivia to the main system."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas transportation","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"23,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas transportation"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"GP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil and gas transportation","code":"GP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901162694","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901162694","DocDate":"13-DEC-1974"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190319013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190319013","DocDate":"30-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67ec3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ec3_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67ec2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ec2_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67ec1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ec1_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67ec0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ec0_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67ebf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ebf_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67ebe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ebe_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67ebd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ebd_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e67ebc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ebc_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e67ebb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ebb_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190314249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190314249","DocDate":"30-JUN-1969"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
