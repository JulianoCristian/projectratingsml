The project will support the establishment of the institutional structure of a new decentralized public agricultural system through financing technical assistance, incremental staff costs, minor civil works, ancillary equipment, and other operational costs. Under the newly established system, responsibility for, and decision making in, the implementation of extension services will be placed at the level of the municipalities. Associations of producers will be established through which beneficiaries themselves will participate with their municipal governments in the management of extension
