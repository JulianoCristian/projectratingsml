The project has been designed to: (i) increase the productivity and incomes of small farmers by introducing them to fertilizer, improved seeds and other agricultural inputs; (ii) strengthen the institutional and technical framework to progressively expand and improve the minimum package program; and (iii) help to ensure long-term productivity of the land by expanding the Borrower's soil and water conservation efforts. By the end of the project period, an additional 150,000 farm families are expected to be served by the minimum package program. After about thirteen years, an estimated 2.0 million farm families will have benefitted from the program and smallholder foodgrain production is expected to have increased substantially. The project primarily faces risks of delays and of possible reductions in scale. However, in view of the importance and high potential of the project for the mostly very low-income Ethiopian farmers, the risks are considered acceptable."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924201048","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924201048","DocDate":"03-SEP-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925035445","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925035445","DocDate":"21-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902314068","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902314068","DocDate":"31-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0452c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0452c_1_0","DocDate":"23-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912293634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912293634","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
