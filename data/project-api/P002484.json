Overall, the project aims to put in place a technical and oganizational system as part of a larger strategy which includes irrigation, livestock, health and range development projects.  The project will: 1) refine and improve semi-mechanized rainfed (SMR) technology in Somalia through onsite adaptive trails; 2) study the institutional structure for semi-mechanized farming activities and propose a self-sustaining model for expansion of rainfed farming; 3) transfer skills to Somalis to manage the enterprises and to farmers to use SMR farming technology through training and extension; and, 4) within the narrow limits of the pilot area, increase smallholder production and incomes for 400 smallholder families."},"country_namecode":"Somali Democratic Republic!$!SO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Annual crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"13,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Annual crops"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SO","sectorcode":"AQ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Annual crops","code":"AQ"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3961214134112","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214134112","DocDate":"24-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e3686a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3686a_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091846","DocDate":"31-MAR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926043301","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926043301","DocDate":"02-MAR-1987"}],"countryname":"Somali Democratic Republic"}},"facets":{}}
