It will provide for comprehensive repair and modernization of the Ye-U system and for complementary agricultural services to project area farmers.  The project will also strengthen the Irrigation Department (ID) by developing (a) a nationwide Master Plan for irrigation rehabilitation and improved operation of at least five large diversion systems; and (b) a comprehensive national program for management of ID's large and growing fleet of heavy equipment. Institutional strengthening will be achieved through the provision of limited but essential technical assistance and upgraded mechanical workshop facilities.  By rehabilitating badly-deteriorated irrigation infrastructure, the project will provide more reliable supply of irrigation water to about 20,000 farm families in the Ye-U command area."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar!$!MM","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"14,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"MM","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961219125308","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219125308","DocDate":"03-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36b95_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36b95_1_0","DocDate":"26-AUG-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar"}},"facets":{}}
