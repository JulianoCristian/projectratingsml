The project would establish a link between research and extension and enhance the intensity, coverage and the content of agricultural extension services. A unified extension system would be developed, under which extension workers would receive biweekly training, visit farmers according to planned schedules, and transmit extension messages. The project would raise production and income levels on about 4.8 m acres of land, cultivated by about 1.4 m farm families. The output includes rice, a wide range of upland crops, coconut and undercrops, vegetables and fruits, and livestock."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924172613","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924172613","DocDate":"31-MAR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd1b3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd1b3_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902331559","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902331559","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
