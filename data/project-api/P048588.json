The second component provides LGU training and capacity building for 1) subproject development and implementation; 2) municipal planning, finances, and management; 3) improved training modules and delivery mechanisms; and 4) piloting of new programs including distance learning; LGU twinning; and collaboration with local governments, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector. The third component supports LGU resource mobilization and monitoring the real property tax administration program; 2) new initiatives to improve creditworthiness and revenue generation; and 3) developing and implementing systems to improve monitoring of fiscal performance and local financial reporting and disclosure.
