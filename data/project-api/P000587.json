The project would address the problems of recurrent cost financing and inadequate budgetary procedures, shortage of skilled manpower and need for better donor coordination in the sector. It would improve rural extension services, training and supervision of staff, monitoring and planning, and budgetary management and finance. It would strengthen animal health, forestry and land conservation programs and would complete two new CADERs and support existing CADER operations. By strengthening the rural services network, the project would provide for a more systematic approach to extension, field trials and development of technical packages, which should lead to increased foodcrop, livestock and fuelwood production and better forestry management. Increased food and meat production would result in import savings. An additional benefit would be the improved nutritional level of the rural population. The project would also promote more efficient use of resources provided by external donors."},"country_namecode":"Union of the Comoros!$!KM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"KM","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925193003","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925193003","DocDate":"24-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000333037_20090122015548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090122015548","DocDate":"24-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05bff_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05bff_1_0","DocDate":"01-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902434728","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902434728","DocDate":"30-APR-1984"}],"countryname":"Union of the Comoros"}},"facets":{}}
