The project consists of three main components. First, two civil works contracts will be awarded, one for works on National Road 6 (NR6) and one for works on National Road 3 (NR3) with a possibility of combination in one single contract. The purpose is to restore key access and urban roads. Second, road maintenance equipment and training aids will be procured under the guidance of the maintenance management and training consultant. This equipment is needed to implement the maintenance works in the urban areas, as well as to maintain NR6 and NR3 after their rehabilitation under the project. Third, the project provides for 1) technical assistance in the form of advisory services and training to the Project Implementing Unit for institutional and capacity building; 2) additional training opportunities for staff; 3) workshops to involve policy dialogue constituencies such as road users, local consultants, etc; and 4) technical assistance for construction supervision."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Cambodia!$!KH","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"45,310,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Resettlement Plan,Environmental Assessment,Resettlement Plan,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Resettlement Plan,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"KH","sectorcode":"JB,BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,56","mjthemecode":"6,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":86},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070820095646","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070820095646","DocDate":"05-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.2","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000012009_20040608104840","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040608104840","DocDate":"01-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000012009_20041207150856","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041207150856","DocDate":"01-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.3","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000012009_20041208092325","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041208092325","DocDate":"10-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122115085","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122115085","DocURL":"19-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122115085","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122115085","DocDate":"19-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173519","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173519","DocDate":"04-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910582247","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910582247","DocDate":"16-FEB-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_99042010292791","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99042010292791","DocDate":"30-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_99042010291085","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99042010291085","DocDate":"30-JUN-1998"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Cambodia"}},"facets":{}}
