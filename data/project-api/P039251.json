The project has three main components and will establish a project management unit to implement the program. 1) Under the privatization services component, technical assistance will be provided to support large state-owned enterprise divestiture through case-by-case privatizations, work-outs and liquidations, and privatizations through pools. 2) Under the financial sector services component, technical assistance to the financial sector will cover advisory services for bank restructuring plus the establishment and operation of the Asset Resolution Agency. 3) Under the business environment component, technical assistance will cover support for implementing the new accounting and audit laws; long term institutional capacity-building in the bankruptcy courts; advisory services for tax reform, and various studies on business environment."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":74},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":16},"sector3":{"Name":"Capital markets","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Capital markets"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"BG,FK,FA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"34,40,42,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,4,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Capital markets","code":"FK"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":74},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":16},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050630092809","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050630092809","DocDate":"25-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010043016252714","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010043016252714","DocDate":"03-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041616102915","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041616102915","DocDate":"17-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99060411143058","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99060411143058","DocDate":"17-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99051205342575","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99051205342575","DocDate":"10-APR-1999"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
