The amount of this credit has been increased from US$33 million equivalent envisaged in the country assistance strategy (CAS) to SDR28.4 million (US$ 43 million equivalent) through the addition of SDR6 million from the pilot crisis response window resources to help Senegal mitigate the lingering impact of the global economic slowdown. This operation is the first of a programmatic series of two PRSCs-PRSC IV of PRSCs IV-V. The proposed series supports the implementation of the final year of the Government's Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II) and assists in the development and early implementation of its successor PRPS-III in the challenging context of an exceptionally unfavorable global environment. The overarching objective of this second series is to contribute to strengthening the Government of Senegal's policy making and institutional capabilities to accelerate broad-based growth, to improve access to social services, to mitigate vulnerabilities, and to foster good governance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":10},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":10},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":50},"theme5":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":10},"totalcommamt":"43,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"YZ,JA,JB,EZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"67,27,55,65,41","mjthemecode":"4,8,6,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20130917160144","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20130917160144","DocDate":"30-SEP-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2010110812182665","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010110812182665","DocDate":"16-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20100506021642","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100506021642","DocDate":"30-APR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20100401111142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20100401111142","DocDate":"31-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100211130748","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100211130748","DocDate":"19-JAN-2010"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
