The additional financing will help finance a funding gap and enable completion of original project activities. There will be no changes to the project's development objectives, results framework and key outcome indicators, and implementation arrangements. As the project is to reach more rural communities than originally envisaged, the project's impact will be enhanced. The program finances: (i) community mobilization, empowerment and capacity building; (ii) block grants to communities to implement sub-projects for reconstruction and development; and (iii) program implementation management support, including program monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood
