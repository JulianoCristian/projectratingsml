The project will have three components.. The National level nutrition activities component includes four sub-components: 1) program development and institution building, to develop national capacity in nutrition and to promote needed policy research and operation research; 2) information, education and communication (IEC) development to assess current behavioral aspects relevant to nutrition an develop appropriate messages and materials for use in IEC activities through inter-personal methods at the community level and through the mass media at the national level; 3) strengthening of existing nutition activities; and 4) project management, monitoring and evaluation. The community-based nutrition component focuses on growth monitoring and promotion activities with targeted and supervised supplementary feeding at the village level in community nutrition centers, which will serve as a locus for inter-personal IEC and mobilization of community actions to promote nutrition. The inter-sectoral nutrition program development will improve nutrition by emphasizing nutritional aspects of activities in various sectors and by supporting innovative actions with potential nutrition impact."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":2},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"59,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"JB,AZ,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,69,68,57","mjthemecode":"7,8,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":2},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000090341_20050707090711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050707090711","DocDate":"13-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02122704010386","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02122704010386","DocDate":"16-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123362281","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123362281","DocURL":"06-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123362281","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123362281","DocDate":"06-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23e95_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23e95_1_0","DocDate":"30-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019095047","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019095047","DocDate":"26-APR-1995"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
