There are five project components. The first reinforces human resources capacity by training school teachers, school administrators, state and local education agency staff, procurement and financial management staff, and television production staff. The second component improves the school environment by setting up focus schools provided with furniture and equipment whose attendance will be determined by local communities; and by funding self-help projects to promote increased access, equity, and quality. The third component improves the quality and availability of curriculum materials. The fourth component develops an enhanced information base for decisionmaking to lay the groundwork for universal basic education. The fifth component uses the mass media to increase HIV/AIDS awareness among school staff, children, and communities."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"55,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"JA,BC,BH,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,57,65,88","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":75},{"Name":"Education","Percent":19},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20080721033216","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080721033216","DocDate":"26-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050623094057","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050623094057","DocDate":"21-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201122766","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201122766","DocURL":"22-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201122766","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201122766","DocDate":"22-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00042605302968","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00042605302968","DocDate":"12-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99072205192563","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99072205192563","DocDate":"29-JUN-1999"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
