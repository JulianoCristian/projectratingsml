The plant will finish 16.6 million linear meters per year of fabrics of medium quality for shirting and suiting. The project would also demonstrate the feasibility of operating at a level of capacity utilization higher than currently practiced in the textile industry in Burma. The project includes consultancy services for assistance in design, engineering, implementation, commissioning services, upgrading the financial, accounting and management information systems and training of staff. The Government will also undertake a study of the textile sector which will focus on measures to improve the productivity of the existing plants, and prepare a long-term development strategy for the sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar!$!MM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"29,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MM","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925175349","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925175349","DocDate":"22-JAN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05df0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05df0_1_0","DocDate":"13-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101743","DocDate":"30-NOV-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901033078","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901033078","DocDate":"30-NOV-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Union of Myanmar"}},"facets":{}}
