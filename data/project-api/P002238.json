It focuses specifically on road maintenance, implementation of a pilot project of about 600 km of rural (communal) roads, and support for improved international access, including deregulation of international transport.  IDA will participate with other donors in the reconstruction of a 75-km section of two of the main roads remaining to be upgraded under the overall roads program.  For the transport sector, the project includes a small shipyard on Lake Kivu and support to improved vehicle safety inspection.  Institutional strengthening, assistance and professional training are included for the ministries concerned (MINITRAPE and MINITRANSCO), as well as to improve road safety and develop local road contractors.  The project will also provide funds for civil works, equipment, supplies, training, and technical assistance.
