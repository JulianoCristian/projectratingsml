The project will inter alia support:  (a) institutional strengthening to improve the National Watershed Development Program (regreening and reforestation) guidelines and policies, overall coordination and operational support; (b) development of the Upper Cimanuk watershed; and (c) investment support for the regreening and reforestation program.  The national institutional strengthening component will provide support for improvement of planning, management and natural resources information systems, the creation of a multi-disciplinary upland research program and training and extension.  The Upper Cimanuk Watershed Conservation and Development component will stabilize critical areas in the Upper Cimanuk watershed (West Java) by supporting the introduction of improved farming systems on 15,750 ha of arable land, combined with soil conservation practices, road upgrading and drainage rehabilitation.  The Cimanuk component will serve as the initial implementation area for the procedural changes and technical approaches promoted by the project under the national regreening and reforestation program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":79},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"sector4":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"56,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Crops"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"AH,BC,TA,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"83,78,79,82,85","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11,10,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":79},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00091205344550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00091205344550","DocDate":"23-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123000899","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123000899","DocURL":"10-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123000899","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123000899","DocDate":"10-DEC-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
