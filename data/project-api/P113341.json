There are four components to the project. The first component of the project is strengthening policies and procedures for school accreditation. This component will focus on improving the accreditation system of medical, dental, nursing, and midwifery schools to make it comparable to internationally recognized systems. The second component of the project is certification of graduates using a national competency-based examination. The project will support the establishment of an independent national evaluation center which will assure the standard of education quality. The third component of the project is results-based financial assistance package (FAP) for medical schools. Building on the agreements on accreditation and certification, the project will allocate FAP for selected medical schools to meet the accreditation standards. The fourth component of the project is project management. The project resources will finance incremental operating costs, project management consultant, office equipment, furniture and project monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
