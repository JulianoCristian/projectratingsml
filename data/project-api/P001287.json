The project is the least costly means of adding to the existing generating facilities to achieve this objective. A further objective is to strengthen the power industry in Kenya by maintaining the power industry's viability through sound institutions and management, and financial powers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion"}],"docty":"Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"PY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","code":"PY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3971201161202","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971201161202","DocDate":"30-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3971201161203","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971201161203","DocDate":"30-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924224419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924224419","DocDate":"29-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e97840_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97840_1_0","DocDate":"08-FEB-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9783e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9783e_1_0","DocDate":"08-FEB-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e9783d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9783d_1_0","DocDate":"08-FEB-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912590970","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912590970","DocDate":"31-JAN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902411531","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902411531","DocDate":"31-JAN-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
