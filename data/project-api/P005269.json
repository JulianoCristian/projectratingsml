It will thus facilitate the movement of key commodities such as phosphate, potash, fertilizer and cement, as well as general cargo.  The project will also contribute to institutional development in the transport sector, already initiated under the earlier Bank-financed transport project.  The highway conponent includes: (i) improvements to routine and periodic road maintenance programs; (ii) acquisition of traffic and payment-testing equipment; and (iii) construction of a 30-km alignment on the Aqaba-Amman road and a 6-km highway improvement spur from this road to the port.  The railway component includes: (i) extension of the Aqaba workshop; (ii) renewal of about 101 km of track; (iii) acquisition of track machinery, 90 phosphate wagons, and a breakdown crane; and (iv) rehabilitation of four locomotives.  In addition, the project includes technical assistance and training for highways, railways, and the port."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other transportation","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other transportation"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"JO","sectorcode":"TY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other transportation","code":"TY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006144417","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006144417","DocDate":"24-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716150550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716150550","DocDate":"30-JUN-1984"}],"countryname":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan"}},"facets":{}}
