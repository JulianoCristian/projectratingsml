Project components address: 1) Shanghai's wastewater management, by financing both collection, trunk sewers, pumping stations, wastewater treatment plants, as well as outfall and sludge treatment methods. Collection systems will include either separate wastewater and storm-water collection systems, or combined wastewater systems, that would include a main conveyor to the treatment plant, incorporating full secondary treatment of effluents discharged through existing outfalls, while sludge, and solid wastes will be disposed at selected landfills; 2) urban solid waste management, to establish environmentally cost-effective municipal solid waste management services in urban areas, by adopting user tariffs to ensure cost recovery of municipal services, as well as adopting a market-oriented institutional arrangement for the provision of municipal solid waste management services. On a pilot basis, a set of administrative, and economic market-based instruments to support waste recycling, will be introduced; 3) urban planning, and pilot upgrading, will assist in the planning for institutional, and administrative frameworks, focused on the planning, construction, and management goals for urban infrastructure improvements, implemented in a three-phase adaptable program lending; 4) the Upper Huangpu River catchment environmental management, to improve its environmental management, and protection of its water resources. To this end, support to policy development, and physical investments will be provided , comprising data collection, analysis of pol"},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
