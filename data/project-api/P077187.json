To support the development of IABIN, this Global Environment Facility (GEF) project seeks to develop an Internet-based, decentralized network that provides wider access to scientifically credible, biodiversity information currently existing in individual institutions, and agencies in the Americas, provide tools to draw knowledge from that wealth of resources, and in turn support sound decision-making concerning the conservation, and sustainable use of biodiversity. The project components will: 1) create the information infrastructure necessary to search, and access biodiversity data and information. To this end, IABIN will seek to develop a regional consensus on standards, and, promote interagency operations with other regional and global efforts, especially the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Under this component, the project will seek agreement on the use of standards and protocols to ensure compatibility of diverse data sources within the region. Areas requiring consensus on standards include: communications, taxonomic information, metadata, controlled vocabularies, other authorities, and record structures; 2) develop a formal Content Development Program, so as to support multilingual training, and provide technical leadership to IABIN countries, as they develop critical data and metadata; 3) improve connectivity between biological, and non-biological data, useful to decision-makers in the public and private sectors. The integration of natural, and social science data and information is increasingly recognized as vital to scientific research and societal decision making; 4) provide financial sustainability, but first, sources of recurring funding for the operation of the Secretariat and othe"},"country_namecode":"Latin America!$!6L","sector1":{"Name":"Information technology","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Information technology"}],"docty":"Project Paper,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"6L","sectorcode":"CA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,80,47","mjthemecode":"5,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Information technology","code":"CA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20110630004725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110630004725","DocDate":"29-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20110630004931","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110630004931","DocDate":"29-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022613222253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022613222253","DocDate":"26-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000014464_2010060909503536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010060909503536","DocDate":"15-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20040614142347","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040614142347","DocDate":"29-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20030624093815","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20030624093815","DocDate":"23-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20030616110421","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20030616110421","DocDate":"12-JUN-2003"}],"countryname":"Latin America"}},"facets":{}}
