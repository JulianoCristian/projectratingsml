The changes and rationale are as follows: 1) a revision of the scope and description of some project sub-components to respond to project, municipal and country realities, including the new education law, Avelino Sinani - Elizardo Perez , which was passed in December 2010; 2) a reallocation of funds among categories consistent with the increase in cost of construction, furniture and equipment and a consequent reduction in the cost and scope of project activities relating to the quality of education and institutional strengthening; 3) a revision of the results matrix to reflect the adjustments in project activities. New indicators have been introduced to monitor the number of direct project beneficiaries; and 4) a six-month extension of the closing date so that the remaining planned classrooms can be completed."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Bolivia: Proyecto de transformaci\u00f3n de la educaci\u00f3n secundaria</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>El Proyecto de transformaci\u00f3n de la educaci\u00f3n secundaria en Bolivia tiene por objeto apoyar la estrategia educativa del gobierno municipal, mediante las siguientes acciones: i) incrementar el acceso y garantizar la permanencia en la educaci\u00f3n secundaria de los j\u00f3venes y adolescentes de su jurisdicci\u00f3n; ii) mejorar la calidad y la pertinencia de la educaci\u00f3n primaria y secundaria, y iii) fortalecer la capacidad de gesti\u00f3n descentralizada del municipio de La Paz.
