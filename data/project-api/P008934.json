Beneficiaries are expected to be mostly small- and medium-scale firms (SMI), which offer the greatest potential of generating employment at a relatively low investment cost per job. To further increase the employment impact of the project, one-third of the Bank loan is earmarked for SSI investments, which are generally more labor-intensive than larger firms, with fixed assets after completion of the investment less than $350,000 if new, or $500,000 if for expansion. The project also envisages the provision of technical assistance, through the services of Turkish industrial consultants, to SYKB's sub-borrowers, with SYKB bearing 80 percent of the costs out of the Technical Assistance Fund. It will support sub-projects primarily in 23 priority urban centers, which account for over 75 percent of urban unemployment in Turkey."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e975fe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975fe_1_0","DocDate":"03-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e975fa_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975fa_1_0","DocDate":"03-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902365290","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902365290","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912515836","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912515836","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
