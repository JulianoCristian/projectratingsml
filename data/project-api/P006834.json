The project aims at strengthening Caja, the main financial intermediary for agricultural credit in Colombia, thereby helping to meet the rural sector's needs for financial services in a more efficient manner.  The project will comprise consultant services, training, office equipment and civil works to assist Caja in defining and implementing measures to improve operational efficiency, reduce its loan portfolio arrears, improve credit procedures, enhance its capacity to mobilize resources using market mechanisms, improve its accounting and management information systems, and rationalize and improve its branch network.  The main project benefit is that Caja will become a more efficient, competitive and self-sustaining financial intermediary."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other agriculture","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other agriculture"}],"docty":"Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"AY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other agriculture","code":"AY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"0000A0035_2010051411574104","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A0035_2010051411574104","DocDate":"10-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"0000A0035_2010042015263906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A0035_2010042015263906","DocDate":"10-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019123316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019123316","DocDate":"28-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042310115296","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042310115296","DocDate":"07-OCT-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926050052","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926050052","DocDate":"21-JAN-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
