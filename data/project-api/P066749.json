The project demonstrates the effectiveness of transparent, merit-based allocation of procedures and investigator autonomy in improving the quality and efficiency of scientific research and training. The project has two phases, the first being financed by a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL). The project has two components. The first builds the capacity of the new Ministry of science and Technology, with technical support to set up national science and technology policies; establishes and operates the Board of directors, Program Committee, and an Implementation and Management Unit; develops a proposal to scale-up and institutionalize the project; and supports monitoring and evaluation studies. The second component sets up a competitive fund for scientific excellence which conducts scientific research, expands doctoral and post-doctoral training programs; and supports networking and outreach as well as special activities to promote scientific excellence. Networking activities include research visits to establish formal and informal connections to high level institutions; coordinates appropriate Initiative-wide activities; supports exchange programs for researchers and students; and designs and delivers international, advanced courses."},"country_namecode":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela!$!VE","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":89},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"VE","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48,66","mjthemecode":"8,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":89},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050627102527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050627102527","DocDate":"20-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201464521","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201464521","DocURL":"15-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201464420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201464420","DocDate":"15-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201464420","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201464420","DocURL":"15-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201464521","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201464521","DocDate":"15-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00062405322362","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00062405322362","DocDate":"28-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00021605302624","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00021605302624","DocDate":"04-FEB-2000"}],"countryname":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela"}},"facets":{}}
