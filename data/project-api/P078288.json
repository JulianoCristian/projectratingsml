The program will focus on demobilization of ex-combatants, and help support their return into civilian life, and, facilitate the reallocation of Government expenditure from military, to social and economic sectors. It is expected the project will have a significant impact on poverty reduction, by establishing more secure conditions in rural areas, thus encouraging the resumption of productive lives in the rural economy, and, will further free additional national resources for investment in social, and economic sectors. Additionally, investments in human capital development of ex-combatants, will further enhance the implementation capacity of community-based development organizations. The main components include demobilization through specific modules, based on an identification card system, a program benefit card, and socioeconomic profiling, to provide transitional assistance in cash, or in-kind; reintegration, through the provision of counseling, and information for potential job opportunities, and assistance in securing employment, as well as educational, or skills improvements within vulnerable groups; and, institutional, and program development, supervised through a program coordinator at high Government levels, but whose implementation shall be the responsibility of a single civilian agency."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Angola!$!AO","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Technical Annex,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AO","sectorcode":"JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"88,51,58,54","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,7,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090805003016","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090805003016","DocDate":"25-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"0000A5900_2008082610204599","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A5900_2008082610204599","DocURL":"14-AUG-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000014464_2010052012371392","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010052012371392","DocDate":"15-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_03031504133611","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03031504133611","DocDate":"07-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03012304092031","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03012304092031","DocDate":"15-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0301090403297","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0301090403297","DocDate":"09-DEC-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Angola","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
