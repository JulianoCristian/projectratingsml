About 60 percent of the new plantings, mainly on very small holdings of less than 10 ha, will be by outgrowers who will receive extension services, input supplies and credit under the project. The project will develop a new 2000 ha nucleus estate at Guiglo, together with the first phase of an outgrowers program surrounding it, and a new 1500 ha estate at Go, to be run by Rubber Research Agency (RRA), of which 500 ha will be for experimental research purposes. In addition to bringing to the production stage the estates at Grand Bereby and Bettie, and earlier developed outgrower schemes, the project will develop a rubber processing factory at Bettie and extend the processing plant at Grand Bereby. Social infrastructure and worker's villages will be provided on the estates. The project will also include studies on the further development of the Ivorian rubber sub-sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire!$!CI","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"32,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CI","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925154042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925154042","DocDate":"23-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000020953_20081222114142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20081222114142","DocDate":"23-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101105","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101105","DocDate":"30-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901003750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901003750","DocDate":"30-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e999df_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e999df_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e999dd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e999dd_1_0","DocDate":"23-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333037_20100324011916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100324011916","DocDate":"01-JUN-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire"}},"facets":{}}
