The project would reduce costs and improve efficiency, thus assuring a satisfactory return to the country's sugar industry, and to the largest employer of labor apart from the Government itself."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Trinidad and Tobago!$!TT","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TT","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902200876","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902200876","DocDate":"31-MAR-1973"}],"countryname":"Republic of Trinidad and Tobago"}},"facets":{}}
