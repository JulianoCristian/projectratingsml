Forestry development will consist of the implementation of forest management plans; the provision of infrastructure, mostly roads; the planting of trees and forage shrubs; felling and thinning; and pest management. Livestock development will consist of increasing forage production and improving forage conservation; the acquisition of selected animals; the introduction of range management based on fixed stocking rates and on deferred and rotational grazing; the provision of infrastructure on the range as well as reseeding and fertilization of forage; the construction of animal health facilities and of breeding stations; and the provision of credit. Cropping development will comprise a reorganization and a reinforcement of existing extension services; problem-specific research linked with extension; the provision of credit; irrigation improvement of some 2,000 ha of small traditional perimeters; and construction of access roads.
