There are six project components. The first builds capacity within the Executive Secretariat to coordinate the National System, including the overall planning, coordination, and supervision of matters related to disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness, and response as well as improvement of the physical plant and equipment. It also aims at improving the National System's operational capacity, especially its emergency preparedness and response capacity. It finances consultants, procedural guides and legal agreements, and emergency response diagnostics. The second component develops a national mitigation program and strategy that involves a national policy for involuntary resettlement to reduce risk from natural disasters and a revision of the national building codes. The third component builds public awareness of disaster prevention by updating the formal education curricula, producing and disseminatng materials to the public, and training journalists and communications employees. The fourth component strengthens the local capacity for disaster risk management. The fifth component implements local vulnerability reduction measures including implementing sub-projects. The sixth component finances costs related to project administration."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Nicaragua!$!NI","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Reducci\u00f3n de la vulnerabilidad ante desastres naturales</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"13,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"NI","sectorcode":"JB,BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Urban development"],"themecode":"73,52","mjthemecode":"6,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":67},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":26},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090917215621","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090917215621","DocDate":"27-AUG-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060114442913","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060114442913","DocDate":"19-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201193771","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201193771","DocURL":"02-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01031705493864","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01031705493864","DocDate":"08-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99072307580050","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99072307580050","DocDate":"21-FEB-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Nicaragua"}},"facets":{}}
