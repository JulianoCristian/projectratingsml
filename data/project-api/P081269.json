The following are components to the project. Primary Education: 1) This component will finance 252 primary classrooms with related facilities including administrative block, kitchen, latrines, and standard classroom furniture. 2) This component will annually finance up to 15,000 bursaries to orphans and other disadvantaged children in upper primary and lower secondary grades. 3) this component will support the additional core primary textbooks needed to cater for new primary enrolment. 3) This component will finance the development of a secondary core textbook rental scheme and revolving fund, and the purchase of the initial start-up stock for the rental scheme. 4). This component will finance (a) a refresher course for primary teachers in core subjects once every two years and (b) annual training of primary inspectors and advisors. 5)  This component will finance the continuous training of school management (principals and their deputies, and primary management committees). 6) Distance Teacher Education Program.
