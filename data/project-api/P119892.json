The closing date for the GEAPP will be extended from August 31, 2011 until December 31, 2011. This trust Fund grant of US$ 7.5 million to the Republic of The Gambia (Recipient) was made available by the European Union Food Crisis Rapid Respond Facility Trust Fund under the Global Food Crisis Response Program (the grant), of which US$ 3.7 million remains undisbursed. The Grant became effective on March 1, 2010. Such overall project objectives remain unchanged and continue to be considered achievable as progress in project implementation remains satisfactory. The performance of the project coordination unit is also satisfactory. Furthermore, there has been no suspension of disbursement for this grant and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial reports. The extension is necessary to provide the recipient with adequate implementation time to complete all project activities and the achievement of the project's objectives, including the full rehabilitation of the 35 village seed storage facilities and three seed multiplication centers envisaged in the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of The Gambia!$!GM","sector1":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Global food crisis response","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"7,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Crops"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GM","sectorcode":"AH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0002411671","geoLocName":"Wuli","latitude":"13.5","longitude":"-14.08333","country":"GM"},{"geoLocId":"0002411712","geoLocName":"Upper Niumi District","latitude":"13.4","longitude":"-16.33333","country":"GM"},{"geoLocId":"0002412176","geoLocName":"Sandu","latitude":"13.41667","longitude":"-14.36667","country":"GM"},{"geoLocId":"0002412421","geoLocName":"Niani","latitude":"13.66667","longitude":"-14.91667","country":"GM"},{"geoLocId":"0002412423","geoLocName":"Niamina East","latitude":"13.63333","longitude":"-15.08333","country":"GM"},{"geoLocId":"0002412717","geoLocName":"Lower Niumi District","latitude":"13.53333","longitude":"-16.41667","country":"GM"},{"geoLocId":"0002413266","geoLocName":"Jarra West","latitude":"13.41667","longitude":"-15.53333","country":"GM"},{"geoLocId":"0002413477","geoLocName":"Foni Kansala","latitude":"13.21667","longitude":"-16.049999","country":"GM"},{"geoLocId":"0002413480","geoLocName":"Foni Bondali","latitude":"13.21667","longitude":"-15.93333","country":"GM"},{"geoLocId":"0002413481","geoLocName":"Foni Bintang-Karenai","latitude":"13.25","longitude":"-16.216669","country":"GM"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development"],"themecode":"91","mjthemecode":"10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Global food crisis response","code":"91"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120830011855","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120830011855","DocDate":"30-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011111917155548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011111917155548","DocDate":"19-NOV-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000386194_20110617000244","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110617000244","DocDate":"31-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000386194_20110616235825","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110616235825","DocDate":"31-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011032315363278","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011032315363278","DocDate":"23-MAR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000334955_20100618072708","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100618072708","DocDate":"01-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000262044_20100121143514","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100121143514","DocDate":"21-JAN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000262044_20091217154711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20091217154711","DocDate":"28-OCT-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of The Gambia"}},"facets":{}}
