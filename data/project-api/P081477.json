The Project objectives are to protect, and enhance the human capital of children in the poorest households, and, to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA), to assist in the implementation of the Special Hardship Case (SHC) program, its main social assistance program. The first component will assist through the provision of a Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program to enhance the existing SHC program. This will expand assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable groups, particularly targeting health and nutrition of children under six years old, and their education up to 18 years of age. The second component will strengthen institutional capacities, through technical assistance for policy planning, training provision and equipment, provision of computer hardware and software, and medical equipment and supplies. Finally, the last component entails cost, that includes the administrative, consulting, and monitoring and evaluation aspects of the project."},"country_namecode":"West Bank and
