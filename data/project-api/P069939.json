The project has four components. The public expenditure component addresses five elements of the public expenditure system, plus strengthening of the management of the Ministry of Finance itself: budget formulation; budget execution (treasury); macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting and analysis; accounting; procurement; and management of the MOF. The second component, the strengthening of human resource management, includes three sub-components: implementation of the recently enacted Civil Service Act; strengthening of the Department of Public Administration; and support of the establishment of an Albanian Institute of Public Administration. The third component, policy coordination, strengthens the capacity of civil service professionals to provide the council of ministers with policy analysis and support its coordination function. The last component ensures project management and implementation, including supporting all the required project administration capacities (accounting, audit, procurement, disbursement management, monitoring and evaluation) and supports several specific initiatives for monitoring and publicizing the intermediate impacts of the government's institutional and public administrative reform program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"8,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Working Paper,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"AL","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Rule of law","Economic management"],"themecode":"22,33,27,25,58","mjthemecode":"7,2,2,3,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","code":"22"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070820132837","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070820132837","DocDate":"24-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Working Paper (WP),  Vol.1","DocType":"WP","EntityID":"000334955_20081117042550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20081117042550","DocDate":"08-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201114232","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201114232","DocURL":"18-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00031505341937","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00031505341937","DocDate":"06-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00030805302248","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00030805302248","DocDate":"01-MAR-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Albania"}},"facets":{}}
