This will be achieved by improving educational opportunity and quality in lower secondary education and strengthening education sector management. The project will accomplish improvement of educational opportunity through: (i) expansion of lower secondary school enrollment; (ii) development of a preservice diploma teacher training program to train lower secondary teachers; and (iii) carrying out a feasibility study for the Solomon Islands College of Higher Education. Improvement of educational quality will be attained through the provision of: (i) equipment and teaching materials, including textbooks; (ii) in-service upgrading for lower secondary teachers; (iii) staff training, housing and consultants for the Curriculum Development Centre; and (iv) new staff and consultants for the Ministry of Education and Training (MET). Finally, the project will also promote improvement of education management through provision of: (i) staff and training for establishing an Implementation and Planning Unit in the MET; and (ii) consultants for the preparation of studies on teacher utilization and incentives."},"country_namecode":"Solomon Islands!$!SB","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"SB","sectorcode":"ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006160603","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006160603","DocDate":"09-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092429","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092429","DocDate":"30-APR-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36b45_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36b45_1_0","DocDate":"29-APR-1986"}],"countryname":"Solomon Islands"}},"facets":{}}
