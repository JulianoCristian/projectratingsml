This is the first in a series of three annual development policy operations (DPO) to assist the Government's reform program in support of Lesotho's Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRGS). The PRSC-I will support Government reform efforts in the following three areas: (i) achieving broad-based growth by improving the business environment and improving the quality of information for decisionmaking; (ii) enhancing the effectiveness of public expenditures by strengthening the links between the PRGS and the macroeconomic and budget framework, and strengthening public finance management; and (iii) improving access and quality of basic services through effective implementation of sectoral programs and empowerment of communities at all levels of Government. In parallel, Bank support directly enhancing Lesotho's growth potential is being addressed through on-going IDA investment projects in infrastructure (transport and water) and private sector development."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Lesotho!$!LS","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Ce descriptif de programme pr\u00e9sente le premier Don et cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 au Royaume du Lesotho.

Le PRSC-1 doit appuyer la politique de r\u00e9forme des pouvoirs publics dans les trois domaines suivants : i) permettre une croissance largement \u00e9tablie, en am\u00e9liorant le climat des affaires et la qualit\u00e9 des informations en vue de la prise de d\u00e9cision ; ii) am\u00e9liorer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses publiques, non seulement en consolidant les liens qui existent entre le PRGS et le cadre macro\u00e9conomique et budg\u00e9taire, mais \u00e9galement en renfor\u00e7ant la gestion des finances publiques ; et iii) am\u00e9liorer l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services essentiels, ainsi que leur qualit\u00e9, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de programmes sectoriels et l\u2019autonomisation des collectivit\u00e9s \u00e0 tous les niveaux des pouvoirs publics.
