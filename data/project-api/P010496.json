There are three components. The first, Management Development and Institutional Strengthening, strengthens planning, management, and implementation capacity at the state, district, and facility levels; and strengthens the health management information system (HMIS) and the capacity for surveillance of major communicable diseases. The second, Improving Service Quality, Access, and Effectiveness at the Secondary Level, upgrades area, sub-divisional, and district hospitals; and improves effectiveness of clinical, managerial, and support services at the facility level. The third component, Improving Access to Basic Health Services at the Community Level, selectively upgrades community health centers; promotes health services for tribal areas and disadvantaged groups; and improves referral mechanisms and strengthens linkages between the different tiers of the health care system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"76,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Other Health Study,Other Health Study,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BH,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"69,57,60,67","mjthemecode":"8,7,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Other Health Study (HLT),  Vol.1","DocType":"HLT","EntityID":"000333037_20141017162235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20141017162235","DocDate":"19-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Other Health Study (HLT),  Vol.2","DocType":"HLT","EntityID":"000333037_20141017163004","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20141017163004","DocDate":"19-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20061227102518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20061227102518","DocDate":"26-SEP-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000160016_20041007103349","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20041007103349","DocDate":"05-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200490027","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200490027","DocURL":"13-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200490329","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200490329","DocURL":"13-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980624142835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624142835","DocDate":"04-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929095316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929095316","DocDate":"05-NOV-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
