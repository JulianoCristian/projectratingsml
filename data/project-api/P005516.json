The AMRL will help Morocco promote a reform targeted towards: a) a National Asset Management Policy; and, b) building Management Systems for the public Health, Education and Higher Education sectors. While the cost of maintenance and asset management can be high in the short term, its return in the longer term is high. Thus, the project will finance the short-term reform costs, and help fill the budgetary gap during the period of adjustment. Improving public asset management will generate efficiency gains, and medium-long-term savings, and improve the maintenance of properties. It will also serve  to promote policy dialogue, partnership, and ownership, essential not only for the implementation of this operation, but also for the long-term reforms needed on overall budget and financial management. However, securing allocation of adequate resources for the purpose of public asset rationalization, and maintenance in future budget laws, remains the most difficult element of the operation, in view of the rigidity of the budget in Morocco. Nonetheless, this risk will be reduced as Morocco moves towards a medium term expenditure framework."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Program Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"BC,JB,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Human development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,25,65,67,30","mjthemecode":"2,8,8,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060724145521","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060724145521","DocDate":"29-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000090341_20060221105007","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060221105007","DocDate":"21-FEB-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123172274","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123172274","DocURL":"18-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123172274","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123172274","DocDate":"18-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02091904565391","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02091904565391","DocDate":"23-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20030515132418","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030515132418","DocDate":"08-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02050904024871","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02050904024871","DocDate":"24-APR-2002"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
