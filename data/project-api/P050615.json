This project, phase one of a comprehensive reform program consisting of sequenced events to be achieved over an eleven-year period, uses the Adaptable Program Lending (APL) instrument. The project aims to a) re-define the role and functions of the state; b) design appropriate institutions and systems to implement this role; and c) rationalize the existing structure and systems to meet the new design. The project has three different components: The first component reforms subvented agencies to make the public sector cost-effective and to reduce the financial burden on government budget by critically reviewing the mandates of mandated agencies--closing down those without a clear mandate, and restructuring those with a viable mandate. The second component restructures the central government--reviewing mandates and responsibilities, removing duplications and overlaps, developing new roles and missions, and realigning functions in line with the decentralization policy. The third component specifically targets systemic constraints in the public sector: it implements a human resource management system, a performance system, an incentive system, and a management information system as well as introduces private sector input and standards on government operations."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"14,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"30,25","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040622101703","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040622101703","DocDate":"27-FEB-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022415185249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022415185249","DocDate":"30-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99042205303723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99042205303723","DocDate":"06-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99040606000845","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99040606000845","DocDate":"02-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061012315250","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061012315250","DocDate":"25-APR-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
