Twenty-seven counties from the provinces of Hebei and Liaoning and the municipalities of Beijing and Qingdao have been identified and all of the subprojects have been prepared at the feasibility level. There are four project components: 1) Irrigation and drainage works and onfarm systems, including canal lining, low-pressure pipes, drains, wells, small structures, surface irrigation improvements, sprinkler systems, and micro-irrigation systems; 2) Agriculture support and services, including land-leveling, non-tillage in the dry season, deep plowing in the rainy season, and soil fertility improvements such as using green manure and stalk, organic and plastic mulching, cropping pattern adjustments, seeds improvement and development of drought resistent varieties, balanced fertilzation, and improved planting and cultivation techniques; 3) Forestry and environmental monitoring; and 4) Institutional development, including training, technical assistance and research as well as establishing and strengthening operation and maintenance entities made up mostly of water users."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
