The project accumulated significant cost savings. The Government of India (GoI)/Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) requested the utilization of these savings for an integrated disaster risk reduction program for highly vulnerable communities in the project area. The activities include: (a) an upgraded early warning system; (b) improved access to evacuation and cyclone shelters; (c) reconstruction of disaster-prone houses; and (d) protection of assets through insurance policy in identified vulnerable coastal locations. The changes constitute a first-order project restructuring aimed towards extending the project development impact by strengthening longer-term disaster preparedness and specifically reducing the vulnerability of coastal communities to a range of natural disasters. This marks a shift from the original response-based approach, required under the project in the immediate aftermath of the Tsunami, towards longer-term risk reduction in the project area."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":69},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry
