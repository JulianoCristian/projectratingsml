The restructuring will: (a) close the provincial water supply component, and transfer the remaining available funds to support: (i) the scaling-up of the sanitation component (part A, being implemented by the non-governmental organization (NGO) 'Center for Development' (CfD); and (ii) additional investments to expand water supply in the Peri-urban water supply component (part B, implemented by the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA), the PPWSA component); and (b) adjust the key performance indicators.
