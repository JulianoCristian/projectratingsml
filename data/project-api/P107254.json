There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is maternal and child health and nutrition. This component will strengthen the community based health system in order to expand and sustain the household and community Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (HWC-IMCI), as well as growth monitoring and promotion in villages already covered in Phase I. The second component of the project is early childhood care and education (ECCE). This component will aim at consolidating quality provision of ECCE services already established in Phase I, expanding cost effective ECCE services to cover all children in the target villages, and ensuring sustainability of interventions in target communities after the completion of Phase II. The third component of the project is project management, monitoring, evaluation, advocacy and strategic communication. This component will provide overall coordination and manage cross cutting issues of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and advocacy and strategic communications."},"country_namecode":"State of Eritrea!$!ER","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Deuxi\u00e8me Projet de d\u00e9veloppement int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de la petite enfance</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le second Projet int\u00e9gr\u00e9 pour le d\u00e9veloppement du jeune enfant en \u00c9rythr\u00e9e a pour objectif de d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la sant\u00e9, la nutrition et l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019enseignement pr\u00e9scolaire des enfants \u00e9rythr\u00e9ens \u00e2g\u00e9s de 6 ans et moins, dans les villages qui sont vis\u00e9s par le projet.
