The project will also provide funds for: (a) employment promotion through the development of commercial and industrial sites, business loans, and (b) assistance to the National Housing Authority (NHA), the Ministry of Human Settlements (MHS) and the Metro Manila Commission (MMC) in institutional development and training. The project is expected to benefit directly approximately 110,000 people in the urban poverty group in Metro Manila, and 78,000 in the three secondary cities. The primary risks are related to the fact that the Government's program has only recently been established. The project units in the regional cities were created only recently, and have not yet been tested. In addition, existing programs of NHA have strained NHA's financial and staff resources, and the local governments responsible for implementation are only now beginning to develop on effective working relationship with NHA on financial and technical matters."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"UH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban housing","code":"UH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190232039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190232039","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912395058","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912395058","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3e8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3e8_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
