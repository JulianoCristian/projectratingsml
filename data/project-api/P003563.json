The project is essentially a financial intermediation operation directed toward increasing supply constraints and strengthening the feed sub-sector infrastructure, and comprises six types of domestic feed ingredient or service capacity building sub-projects or components and one feed sub-sector strengthening component.  The six capacity building components include: 1) integrated feed and livestock production; 2) feed additives manufacture; 3) feed protein crop production; 4) feed processing equipment design and manufacture; 5) enhanced-protein feed product synthesis; and 6) feed commodity wholesale marketing."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
