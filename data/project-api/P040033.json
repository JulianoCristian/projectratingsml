The project will also support social sector grants to mitigate the social costs of adjustment, as well as high priority road and school maintenance and rehabilitation work to ensure that these physical assets do not deteriorate during the adjustment period.  The components of this project are (i) privatization of the state banks (Banco de Credito Real de Minas Gerais S. A. - CREDIREAL and Banco de Estado de Minas Gerais - BEMGE); (ii) sale and concessioning of Companhia Estadual de Gas de Minas Gerais - GASMIG); (iii) concessioning of two segments of state roads with a total of 460 kilometers; (iv) establishment of an adequate regulatory framework for the private provision of public services; and (v) fiscal performance consistent with the capital spending program and fiscal indicators cited in the state's Privatization Program Letter."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":23},"sector4":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"170,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"EZ,TA,YZ,FA,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Human development","Human development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,65,67,43","mjthemecode":"4,8,8,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":34},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":23},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":23},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980624085756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624085756","DocDate":"09-APR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184514","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184514","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
