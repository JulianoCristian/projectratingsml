Furthermore, the space utilization and energy efficiency of educational facilities will be improved, and institutional management capacity will be strengthened. The main components are: a) to achieve operating efficiency in school buildings, obtaining substantial reductions from recurrent expenditures. Essential repairs will generate savings in current expenditures, allowing benefiting municipalities to contribute a percentage of these savings for education spending. Further improvements are expected in physical facilities, in laboratories and equipment upgrading, as well as in the provision of in-service teacher training; b) to increase education quality, through the Ministry of Education and Science (MES) capacity building, for assessing and monitoring student achievements. Five sub-components will support education quality: national content and performance standards; national standardized assessment instruments; communications strategy and public relations; school self-improvement model; and, strengthening policy capacity; c) to ensure project management efficiency, consulting and training will be included in the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Latvia!$!LV","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":31},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"31,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"LV","sectorcode":"BC,EZ,EV,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"65,61,81","mjthemecode":"11,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":31},{"Name":"Education","Percent":31},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":13},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20050216144549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050216144549","DocDate":"11-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200410494","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200410494","DocDate":"19-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200410494","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200410494","DocURL":"19-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99042805372653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99042805372653","DocDate":"12-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911070478","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911070478","DocDate":"07-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052810572538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052810572538","DocDate":"14-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Latvia"}},"facets":{}}
