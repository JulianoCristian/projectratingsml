The project components include: 1) expansion of the water supply system, to cover water production systems, increasing water coverage, and replacing primary distribution mains. Mitigation of the water treatment sludge environmental impact, will include remote control systems. An Unaccounted-For-Water reduction plan will also be included; 2) the expansion of the sewerage system in the Cienaga Basin, will enhance the conveyance capacity of existing sewage collectors which currently drain to the basin. Secondary sewerage will be expanded within this part of the city. New pressure lines, pumping stations, and gravity collectors will be constructed in residential areas; 3) the construction of the main wastewater conveyance system, consisting of reinforced concrete pressure pipe; 4) construction of wastewater treatment installations; 5) construction of a submarine out-fall; 6) Industrial wastewater discharge control; and, 7) mitigation measures due to the environmental and social impacts of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de abastecimiento de
