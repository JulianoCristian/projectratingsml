This will facilitate better land-related investments and more productive and environmentally sustainable land use. The project has the following three components: Component 1) will complete land regularization within El Salvador. In the context of LAP II, regularization refers to the systematic and massive dissemination campaign, mapping, verification of rights, delimitation of properties, resolution of field conflicts, notification of results, transfer of information to Property Registry and Cadastre Information System (SIRyC), and legalization and/or titling of lands in areas of social interest. Component 2) will improve the execution of day-to-day registry and cadastre services at local level (e.g., registration of titles, cadastral certificate emissions). Component 3) although National Registry Center (CNR) will be the sole implementing agency, it will deal with various participating institutions and partners."},"country_namecode":"Republic of El Salvador!$!SV","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"40,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Indigenous Peoples Plan,Project Information Document","countrycode":"SV","sectorcode":"BG,BH,BC,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Rule of law","Rule of law","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83,75,36,34,73","mjthemecode":"9,3,3,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":80},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000333037_20080307014114","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080307014114","DocDate":"09-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010041412135202","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010041412135202","DocDate":"22-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20050224104205","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050224104205","DocDate":"15-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20050112102755","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050112102755","DocDate":"05-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20050111112239","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050111112239","DocDate":"15-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.2","DocType":"IP","EntityID":"000012009_20050112153828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050112153828","DocDate":"01-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20041013100904","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20041013100904","DocDate":"27-AUG-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of El Salvador"}},"facets":{}}
