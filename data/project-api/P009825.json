The project would construct a new container and bulk freight port with associated dredging of access channels at the Nhava Sheva site, about 20 kms distance from the existing, overcrowded Bombay port.  Also included is the necessary mechanical equipment, linkages to the Indian Railway (IR) network, land acquisition, staff housing, and training in port operations.  The new port is expected to move an annual volume of 250,000 containers and 3.7 million tons of bulk cargo (foodgrain and fertilizers) by 1993.  The project return is sensitive to traffic forecasts and delays in completion of the construction and commissioning of the port.  Traffic forecasts have been conservatively estimated, however, and adequate provision for additional financing of the NSPT's operations in the critical early years has been arranged."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99aa1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99aa1_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a9f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a9f_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902434626","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902434626","DocDate":"29-FEB-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
