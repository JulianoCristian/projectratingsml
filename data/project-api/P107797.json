The development objective is the enhancement of governance and accountability, and of financial stability, in the sector leading to better and more sustainable service provision. The benefits of the project are follows: (i) enhanced quality, transparency, and efficiency of power generation contracting processes leading to increased private investment on competitive terms; (ii) enhanced governance of corporative service providers, including through improved metering, billing and collection systems; (iii) accelerated development of regulatory capacity by strengthening the operations of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission; and (iv) reduction of commercial losses. The risks under this project are: (i) change in Government leading to change in policy; (ii) macro-fiscal deterioration that complicates energy pricing adjustments; (iii) inadequate investor interest to meet Bangladesh's power sector needs on affordable terms; (iv) labor strife that blocks governance reform, especially in the context of the corporatization process; and (v) service delivery problems, linked to both inadequate generation and natural gas shortages, that damage the credibility and legitimacy of the GOB reform program."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":83},"sector2":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":16},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"},{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"LZ,LT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,78,39,30","mjthemecode":"2,4,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":83},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20091021030906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20091021030906","DocDate":"25-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2008092315421359","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008092315421359","DocDate":"17-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2008092315421359","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008092315421359","DocURL":"17-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333038_20080602042247","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080602042247","DocDate":"14-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20080513113246","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080513113246","DocDate":"08-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000076092_20080418125325","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080418125325","DocDate":"07-APR-2008"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
