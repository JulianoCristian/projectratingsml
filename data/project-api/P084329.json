The Grant will finance block grants to village communities, consultants for community facilitation and sub- project preparation, consultants for program management and monitoring, capacity building and implementation support for the implementing ministry, and consultants for external evaluation.  The project benefits will be (i) the empowerment o f local communities through the establishment o f village level consultative decision making and representative local leadership as a basis for interaction within and between communities on the one hand, and with the administration and aid agencies on the other; and (ii) local level reconstruction, development, and capacity building leading to a decrease in poverty levels. Through these benefits, the project will also contribute to stability in Afghanistan. Likely risks are weak institutional capacity; a fragile security situation; elite capture o f benefits, and misuse o f funds. Appropriate mitigation measures have been proposed to address these risks.  The Credit i s expected t o be fully disbursed in a 33 month period."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and
