The project comprises the following components: 1) decentralization of the electric power corporation's (EEPCO) accounting system; 2) decentralization of part of EEPCO's billing system as a pilot, which requires branch office renovation, computer, software, and accessory installation, as well as other training and consulting services; 3) manpower development to support EEPCO's restructuring to give more control to regional management; 4) construction of the Gilgel Gibe hydroelectric plant to increase generation capacity; 5) establishment of a dam safety, maintenance management system, and optimization of water use; 6) strengthening rural energy capability by adapting technology and training research personnel overseas in various energy fields; 7) completion of the Woody Biomass inventory data collection and remote sensing survey indicating the extent and productivity of grazing lands and undertaking a livestock carrying capacity analysis; 8) studies including sector restructuring study, a generation expansion study, a tariff study, and a valuation of fixed assets; and 9) assistance with converting the state-owned utility (EEPCO) into a commercial operation, as well as other restructuring measures."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Renewable energy"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"LE,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,39,78,81,44","mjthemecode":"4,11,10,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":98},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20060727084037","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060727084037","DocDate":"29-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121302300","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121302300","DocURL":"25-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121302601","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121302601","DocDate":"25-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121302300","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121302300","DocDate":"25-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121302601","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121302601","DocURL":"25-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980203114907","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980203114907","DocDate":"13-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184641","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3971201161151","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971201161151","DocDate":"31-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3971201161152","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971201161152","DocDate":"31-JUL-1997"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
