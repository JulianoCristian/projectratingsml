This paper is to request a level two restructuring of the project. In particular it is requested to amend the project's results indicators, reallocate grant proceeds, acknowledge the withdrawal of a project partners as well as to adjust/cancel certain specific project activities. A reallocation of the International Development Association (IDA) credit and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant is necessary to allocate unallocated funds to categories where funds are needed to enable progress toward development and global environment objective. No reallocation is proposed for the PHRD grant. The reallocation has some differences with the reallocation attached in the Government of Mozambique (GoM) request. This difference originates from a careful recalculation of the project budget and comparison with the undisbursed balance which was carried out during the March 2011 project support
