The other objectives are: (1) pilot implementation of management reforms to improve public irrigation performance and to upgrade the government s capacity to improve irrigation services and command area management; (2) retrospectively mitigating the adverse impacts of land acquisition under the APII, and proactively provide economic rehabilitation for those families still to be affected by completing the Srisailam Right Branch Canal Project (SRBC) works; (3) ensuring the safety and sustainability of three dams supplying water to the project areas; (4) implementing a mandated regional program of environmental improvements, safeguards, and natural resource conservation; and (5) improving government monitoring and evaluation capacity for large irrigation projects. Six components are needed to achieve project objectives: (1) Irrigation Development and Rehabilitation Works-supporting completion of all SRBC civil works begun under   APII; and selected civil works under the Sriramasagar Project (SRSP); (2) Agricultural Services Programs-applying research and demonstrating irrigation practices and agronomy, establishing water users association, and providing training to staff and farmers;  (3) Resettlement and Rehabilitation Program-economically rehabilitating families adversely affected by acquiring past and proposed land for SRBC and SRSP works; (4) Environmental Management Plan-supporting India s mandated regional program of environmental safeguards and nature conservation in command area districts; (5) Dam Safety
