The project has made noteworthy progress in 2008, which continued in 2009. The last supervision mission recorded significant progress in all three project components and the rating was upgraded. The project is now at a phase when different activities under the three components start fitting together, allowing the Project to achieve its overall objective. Given the extension, end of project target dates for achieving final results will be adjusted accordingly. The extension is necessary to complete ongoing management information system (MIS) related activities, which are a key to attaining the project development objective (PDO). The key milestones established as conditions for considering project extension have been met, particularly in terms of completion of civil works and development of the MIS. The project's implementation schedule has been revised to allow completing it by the proposed closing date. This revised schedule puts project activities into a tight timeframe and leaves no room for delays. Recent payment delays by the national treasury affected income tax (IT) contracts execution. Therefore, the team agreed to reduce the minimum application size for payments directly from the loan account from USD1.8 million to USD200,000 for a six month period and already communicated this decision to the Borrower. This reduction will accelerate payments under large IT contracts. This will be the second extension for the project. The first extension was for 17 month reflecting far too short implementation period for the project that covers introduction of the new client intake model in more than 750 local welfare offices all over Ukraine.
