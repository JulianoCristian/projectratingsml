There are four project components. Component 1 provides support to district health authorities to improve service delivery and outreach. The medium-term goal is to reduce inequalities across and within districts, by addressing disparities in maternal and child health indicators in disadvantaged areas and among vulnerable groups. Component 2 aims at promoting synergy across selected central programs and their convergence at the provincial and district level. It also addresses some of the structural deficiencies in the hospital network. Component 3 strengthens the capacity for stewardship of the central health ministry and increasing the credibility, transparency and accountability of the public health system, particularly in the areas of policymaking, budget formulation and monitoring and evaluation. Component 4 supports project management for all activities, including the technical assistance needed to upgrade the District Health Authorities into Program Management Centers and the design and implementation of a Monitoring Information System (MIS) to supervise project implementation. This component would also support the collection of baseline, mid-term and end-line data and issue-specific studies related to seeking solutions to implementation problems."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":26},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social
