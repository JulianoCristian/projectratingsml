The project components include: (a) rehabilitation and development of the cashew subsector; (b) assistance to agricultural enterprises; and (c) specific subsectoral studies and surveys.  Under the first component, financing will be provided for: (a) equipment, incremental costs and technical assistance to agricultural extension, research, and cashew nut nurseries and to the state secretariat; (b) investment credit to commercial farmers and traders and for cashew processing factories.  Because women play a dominant role in agriculture and cashew marketing, a survey will be carried out to assess factors determining the agricultural productivity of women and measures to be taken to enhance benefits accruing to them.  Under the second component, financing for technical assistance, incremental costs, and equipment will be provided to develop a capacity within the Ministry of Agriculture to address the rehabilitation needs of agricultural enterprises and provide them with managerial and planning assistance and training.  The third component will finance studies and surveys."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"15,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"AB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,44","mjthemecode":"4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":85},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120582011","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120582011","DocURL":"24-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120582011","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120582011","DocDate":"24-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e085b6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e085b6_1_0","DocDate":"06-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928235819","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928235819","DocDate":"14-AUG-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique"}},"facets":{}}
