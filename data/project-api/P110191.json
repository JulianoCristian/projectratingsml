The 4 earlier DPLs from 2004 to 2007 constituted a program of annual, single tranche loans anchored to the previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The overall goal of the DPL-5 program is to help the Government of Indonesia (GoI) achieve its medium-term growth and poverty reduction objectives. The DPL-5 supports the GoI's reform efforts in the following objectives: (i) improve the investment climate; (ii) enhance public financial management and governance; and (iii) improve service delivery to the poor. The investment pillar is aligned to the CPS objective of enhancing the environment for private sector development to foster accelerated growth and poverty reduction and strengthen competitiveness and inclusiveness. The public financial management triggers are also designed to support another key policy area of the CPS on strengthening central government institutions and systems through increasing accountability and transparency in government financial management and to enhance public financial management and governance to increase the development impact of priority budget expenditures. Finally, improving the institutional capacity to better target poverty alleviation programs is a critical step to achieving the CPS objective of more efficient delivery of public services to reduce poverty levels and improve equity."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"SME Finance","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":43},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":7},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":7},"totalcommamt":"750,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"SME Finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Information Document,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"FH,FZ,JB,YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"41,54,25,40,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,4,2,6,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"SME Finance","code":"FH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":22},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":14},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":7},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20120325233036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120325233036","DocDate":"11-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2009032515420063","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009032515420063","DocURL":"10-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20081117100717","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20081117100717","DocDate":"11-NOV-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20081118002434","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20081118002434","DocDate":"07-NOV-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20080917101815","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080917101815","DocDate":"27-AUG-2008"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
