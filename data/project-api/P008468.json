The objectives of the project are to combine physical expansion and modernization of the network with institutional strengthening through technical assistance and training. The specific focus will be finalization of a strategy and implementation plan for digitalization and automatization of the network together with implementation of the first phase of that program.  The main elements of the project are: (a) construction of a digital overlay long-distance network with attendant connections to local networks and, directly, to large-volume customers; (b) strengthening of the commercial orientation and capacity of Magyar Tavkozlesi Vallalat (MTV) (e.g., by implementing the Management Information System (MIS), developing and implementing modern accounting systems, reorganizing operations along commercial lines, etc.); and (c) introducing a regulatory framework to encourage competition in selected portions of the telecommunications sector."},"country_namecode":"Hungary!$!HU","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Telecommunications"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"HU","sectorcode":"CT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Urban development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,39,78,71,44","mjthemecode":"4,9,10,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970909142121","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970909142121","DocDate":"30-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042011370986","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042011370986","DocDate":"29-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040512060787","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040512060787","DocDate":"29-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929152133","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929152133","DocDate":"13-SEP-1990"}],"countryname":"Hungary"}},"facets":{}}
