A level-two project restructuring is proposed to facilitate: (i) reallocation of the credit between unallocated funds and categories of expenditure for better utilization of funds; (ii) extension of the closing date from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011 (12 months) to permit time for implementation of several important activities to better achieve the development objectives, as well as facilitate a smoother preparation transition for the next program; and (iii) inclusion of some changes in the key performance indicators and targets which were agreed at the mid-term review to ensure consistency with newly available baseline data at that time."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
