The specific implementation objectives are: 1) in water resource management - to formulate an integrated, multisectoral strategy for the shared use of water by households, industry, and agriculture that will be coordinated with future development projects in these sectors; 2) in institutional capacity building - to strengthen the capacity of Management and Planning Unit for Water Resources to monitor aquifer exploitation, that of the newly established National Water Company of Senegal to formulate and enforce policy and strategy, and that of the National Office of Urban Sanitation to develop a strategy for urban and peri-urban sanitation improvement; 3) in urban water production and distribution - to reduce leakages in the Greater Dakar water distribution system and to increase the region's water production capacity; and 4) in urban sanitation - to increase the effectiveness of the existing Dakar sewerage system, develop sanitation in secondary towns, and promote the reuse of treated municipal wastewater for irrigation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"}],"docty":"Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"WA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"30,84,85","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"11,11,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":85},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000333037_20081026233710","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20081026233710","DocDate":"01-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009486_20050112094450","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009486_20050112094450","DocDate":"21-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121270383","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121270383","DocDate":"12-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121270383","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121270383","DocURL":"12-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e23f01_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23f01_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23f00_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23f00_1_0","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961008043600","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008043600","DocDate":"12-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019111457","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019111457","DocDate":"12-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110225","DocDate":"01-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110224","DocDate":"01-MAR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
