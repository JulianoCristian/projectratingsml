It would:  (a) replace the existing (delapidated) main canal with a parallel lined canal together with modern regulating and access structures; (b) modernize 43,000 ha of the distribution system with lined channels down to and including watercourses; and (c) construct augmentation tubewells on the lined distributaries.  In addition, it would:  (d) undertake a reconnaissance drainage survey of the UGC command area and a detailed drainage study and pilot works program within the distributary blocks to be modernized; (e) initiate construction of a modern canal communication system; (f) construct one small hydroelectric station and initiate the civil works of another station.  Furthermore, the project would:  (g) set up a water and land management institute; (h) strengthen the project organization, train staff and provide study tours, visits and technical assistance; and (i) provide vehicles, plant and equipment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"125,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019114818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019114818","DocDate":"07-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902443111","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902443111","DocDate":"31-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c3a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c3a_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05c38_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05c38_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAY-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
