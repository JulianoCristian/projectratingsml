The extension is thus necessary to complete seven works contracts and deliver one student combined seats contract for schools financed under the project. These contracts are small in size, less than US$405,000 equivalent, and will be completed as soon as the security condition stabilizes. The closing date was then extended from June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2011 and an Additional Financing (AF) credit for an amount of SDR18.8 million (US$29.84 million) was approved on April 22, 2008. The additional financing agreement was signed on July 1, 2008, and declared effective on August 19, 2008. The closing date of both credits was originally June 30, 2011.
