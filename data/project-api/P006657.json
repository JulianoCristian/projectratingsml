The project includes two components. Part A includes (a) reconstruction of earthquake-damaged container and general cargo berths at San Antonio and Valparaiso, and remodelling and expanding related backup areas; (b) construction of a new berth at the highly congested port of San Vicente; (c) rehabilitation of the Baron berth at Valparaiso; (d) technical assistance for institutional, engineering and other project-related studies; and (e) training.  Part B components comprise construction of fishing jetties, port access facilities, and construction of inland terminals.  The project brings no adverse environmental impact and will have aseismic design to prevent earthquake damage."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"71,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"BC,TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,39","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00010605594897","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00010605594897","DocDate":"21-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122485585","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122485585","DocURL":"21-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052010100884","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052010100884","DocDate":"21-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122485585","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122485585","DocDate":"21-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001204542","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001204542","DocDate":"21-NOV-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001204303","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001204303","DocDate":"21-NOV-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile"}},"facets":{}}
