There are three main components. The first funds capacity building for new or existing self-managed community-based organizations. Specifically, it helps form and develop common interest groups and self-help groups, and their support organizations; provides information, education, and communications support including awareness building campaigns and demonstrations in village communities on issues affecting social and/or economic activities of interest to the rural poor; aids capacity building of local governing councils to improve micro-planning, financial management, and sensitization to the needs of the poor; promotes skill enhancement for participating staff and nongovernmental organizations; and introduces a pilot program linking local groups to banking institutions. The second component funds demand-driven sub-projects which will improve access to public social services; generate income through investments; and build facilities like community halls, school facilities, connector roads, and water supply and waste disposal systems. The third component finances a package of inter-related activities involving both non-formal and formal education which addresses the twin problems of child labor, especially girl child laborers, and high school drop-out rates."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":27},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"111,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"}],"docty":"Working Paper,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"WZ,EZ,TA,BH,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"79,57,65,59","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"7,8,7,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":27},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":21},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Working Paper (WP),  Vol.1","DocType":"WP","EntityID":"000334955_20100215034425","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100215034425","DocDate":"01-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080813004547","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080813004547","DocDate":"26-JUL-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031110172200","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031110172200","DocDate":"12-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050612231301","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050612231301","DocDate":"12-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00032106061327","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00032106061327","DocDate":"31-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00032106061428","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00032106061428","DocDate":"31-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00032405341081","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00032405341081","DocDate":"20-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99111305444943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99111305444943","DocDate":"22-FEB-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of India","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
