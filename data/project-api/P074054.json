Priority expenditures in the emergency program, will support the creation of decentralized institutions, and the implementation of the national reconciliation agreement. The project aims at maintaining macroeconomic stability, and addressing urgent social needs, by financing imports, including petroleum, agricultural equipment, construction materials, and capital goods, while, foreign exchange will be provided to finance increased import requirements arising from the spending, generated by the economic recovery program. The program will target urgent public expenditures needed to alleviate poverty, and support the process of national reconciliation. Nonetheless, risks include a) the possibility that the national reconciliation process, could stall, or be reversed, though careful monitoring of the process, and the strong support by stakeholders, development partners, and international mediators has been confirmed, and, b) the Government's weak capacity to sustain economic recovery efforts, but technical assistance provision in expenditure management will mitigate this risk."},"country_namecode":"Union of the Comoros!$!KM","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Technical Annex","countrycode":"KM","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,56,23,26","mjthemecode":"2,1,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20030616161250","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20030616161250","DocDate":"20-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201244170","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201244170","DocURL":"10-SEP-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01072704145067","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072704145067","DocDate":"18-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_01071904124227","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01071904124227","DocDate":"11-JUL-2001"}],"countryname":"Union of the Comoros"}},"facets":{}}
