In Oran the project provides for the construction of a new surface water production system, a demineralization plant and the rehabilitation of the existing production facilities.  In Constantine it provides for the construction of new water production works and expansion of the distribution network, collection and treatment of wastewater for refuse in irrigation.  Technical assistance will be provided under the project to the recently established regional water companies to help them streamline their organization, operational procedures and financial systems.  It will also supply water for industrial and commercial development."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"262,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019114448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019114448","DocDate":"26-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094945","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094945","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
