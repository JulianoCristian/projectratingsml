The project has the following three components: Component 1) most commercial financiers in Bulgaria are reluctant to finance EE transactions due to their unfamiliarity with such projects and perceived weak client/project credit profiles. This facility will be used for credit enhancement purposes to share in the credit risk of EE finance transactions. Component 2) under this facility, sub-loans will be made on a commercial basis to creditworthy customers that will revolve with interest and principal payments into Bulgaria Energy Efficiency Fund (BEEF) for additional loans. Component 3) covers the following two broad areas: Capacity Building and Information Barrier Removal: to fund activities in initial project pipeline development and project evaluation, workshops and seminars for potential co-financiers and clients. Fund Administration: to finance set-up and running costs of the Fund during the first four years, including the salaries of Fund staff, when the Fund is not yet self-financing."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":45},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and
