Provision of water supply and sanitation (WSS), supported by essential hygiene and sanitation education, will improve the health status and productivity of the poor communities. The project serves about 2 million people living in selected rural and urban low-income communities in six provinces. Provincial level poverty status is the main consideration for selecting these provinces. The project comprises two broad components. The first component, water supply, provides safe water to about 2 million people in about 1,400 communities. This includes construction of piped systems (spring capture, groundwater, and surface) and non-piped systems (protected dug wells, protected springs, shallow and deep wells with hand pumps, rainwater collectors, and appropriate systems). About 10 percent of the water supply component provides for rehabilitation of existing facilities. The second component, sanitation, provides appropriate sanitation facilities to approximately 1.7 million people through a process of demonstration, training, and promotion to encourage beneficiary and private-sector participation in constructing and financing sanitation facilities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":53},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":18},"sector3":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":9},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Working Paper,Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"JA,BZ,WA,JB,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,78,59,84,63","mjthemecode":"8,11,7,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":53},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":18},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":14},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Working Paper (WP),  Vol.1","DocType":"WP","EntityID":"000334955_20091105043240","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20091105043240","DocDate":"01-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000094946_01071404014864","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01071404014864","DocDate":"20-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00092105321010","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00092105321010","DocDate":"16-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122592468","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122592468","DocURL":"12-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122592468","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122592468","DocDate":"12-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004185716","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004185716","DocDate":"27-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004185351","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004185351","DocDate":"26-MAY-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
