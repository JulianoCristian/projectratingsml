The project is the first phase of support for immunization, with a second project anticipated about two years after this project becomes effective. There are three project components. The first helps eradicate polio by supplying polio vaccine and funding social mobilization activities such as orientation and training, transport, information and education, surveys and evaluations, and other activities needed to assure coverage of the target population. The second component improves the quality of routine immunization. It addresses critical weaknesses in program management (such as monitoring, micro-planning, and training) and selectively upgrades cold chain and injection safety equipment, and improves disease surveillance capacity in selected laboratories. The third component supports activities required to develop a strategic framework to deal with vaccine-preventable diseases during the next 7-10 years."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"142,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,63,57,78","mjthemecode":"10,7,8,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060731101710","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060731101710","DocDate":"28-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201120752","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201120752","DocURL":"19-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201120953","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201120953","DocURL":"19-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00040805473680","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00040805473680","DocDate":"30-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00012505453557","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00012505453557","DocDate":"10-JAN-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
