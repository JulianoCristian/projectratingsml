Objectives include: (a) relatively faster growth of enrollment in economics/finance and postgraduate education; (b) broadening of present over-specialized curricula; (c) accelerated in-service training and promotion of younger faculty; (d) strengthening of experimental work and academic support services such as computer and audio-visual centers and libraries; (e) improvement in longer-term manpower planning, facilities planning and university resource utilization; and (f) introduction of project monitoring and evaluation. In support of the program, the project would help finance: (a) equipment and materials including books and journals related to engineering and economics/finance for about 35 subproject universities; and (b) technical assistance and equipment for five national programs comprising specialist services, fellowships, staff exchange, studies, and training centers."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5927\u5b66\u53d1\u5c55\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u4e3a\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u7d20\u8d28\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u624d\u961f\u4f0d\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u56fd\u5bb6\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5341\u5e74\u89c4\u5212\uff081985-1994\uff09\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8be5\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4e00\u671f\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e/\u91d1\u878d\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5ea6\u6539\u9769\uff0c\u5176\u5177\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u63a8\u52a8\u7ecf\u6d4e/\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u62db\u751f\u4eba\u6570\u8f83\u5feb\u589e\u957f\u53ca\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6559\u80b2\u8f83\u5feb\u53d1\u5c55\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u62d3\u5bbd\u73b0\u6709\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8303\u7574\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u52a0\u5feb\u5e74\u8f7b\u6559\u5e08\u5728\u804c\u57f9\u8bad\u6b65\u4f10\u548c\u664b\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u52a0\u5f3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u7535\u6559\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u7b49\u5b66\u4e60\u652f\u6301\u670d\u52a1\uff1b\uff085\uff09\u5b8c\u5584\u957f\u671f\u4eba\u624d\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8bbe\u65bd\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u5b66\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff1b\uff086\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u9879\u76ee\u76d1\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5236\u5ea6\u3002\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5341\u5e74\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u534f\u52a9\u6295\u8d44\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5185\u5bb9\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4e3a35\u6240\u5927\u5b66\u8d2d\u4e70\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8d44\u6599\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66/\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u6742\u5fd7\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ea7\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6280\u672f\u63f4\u52a9\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e13\u5bb6\u670d\u52a1\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u5956\u5b66\u91d1\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u4eba\u5458\u4ea4\u6d41\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u57f9\u8bad\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"145,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019112510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019112510","DocDate":"19-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151745","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904162525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904162525","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05cf8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05cf8_1_0","DocDate":"26-FEB-1985"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
