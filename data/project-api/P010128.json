The Primary Education Project will: (a) strengthen the teacher service through an extensive training program; (b) improve supervision; (c) provide instructional materials as well as technical assistance to develop new materials and curricula; and (d) finance the construction of class-rooms and teachers' residences. Project assistance will particularly be directed at provision of facilities and services that reach females and rural poverty groups. The selective provision of project elements will establish a basis for evaluation of their relative contribution to improve access, lower dropout rates, a better quality of instruction, pupil achievement, and reduced cost in the delivery of primary education."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924175731","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924175731","DocDate":"29-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924175629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924175629","DocDate":"19-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912430293","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912430293","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902323574","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902323574","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c62_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c62_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c61_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c61_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c60_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c60_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c5f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c5f_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c5e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c5e_1_0","DocDate":"29-MAR-1979"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
