Its specific objectives are to 1) stabilize the physical condition, arrest the further deterioration of the non-concessional national road network, and reduce the log-on economic costs for repairing and maintaining the national road network; 2) increase private sector participation; and 3) adapt the role of and further strengthen the national highways directorate's (DNV) capabilities for planning, contracting, and efficient supervision. The project has four components. The first three consist of civil works including rehabilitation and maintenance of the non-concessioned paved network including resurfacing and reconstruction. The fourth component covers technical assistance, training, and equipment to strengthen DNV's organizational capabilities both at central and regional levels and to support knowledge-based programs including making studies and issuing manuals as well as modernizing the sector library."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"450,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"78,44","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000020439_20071004084821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20071004084821","DocDate":"01-JUL-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060629105649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060629105649","DocDate":"16-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201391097","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201391097","DocURL":"20-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201390795","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201390795","DocDate":"20-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201390896","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201390896","DocDate":"20-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201390896","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201390896","DocURL":"20-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201390795","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201390795","DocURL":"20-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201391097","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201391097","DocDate":"20-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980319095932","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980319095932","DocDate":"20-FEB-1998"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
