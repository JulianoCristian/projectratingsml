Construction would include interchanges and spur roads for access to the new toll facility. The project would provide essential road capacity on the major route from the capital of Jakarta to virtually all of Java and thus provide substantial benefits to the regional economy. Also included in the project are consultancy services for toll road management and for regional transport planning. There are no unusual technical or other risks associated with this project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"85,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e976c7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976c7_1_0","DocDate":"08-SEP-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902381365","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902381365","DocDate":"31-AUG-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100429033524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100429033524","DocDate":"19-AUG-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
