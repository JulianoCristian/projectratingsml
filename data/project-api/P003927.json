To that end, the project consists of (a) special Maintenance works on about 400,000 ha of irrigated land, about 106,000 ha of reclaimed swamp land, and five river mouths, so that these can sustain efficient O&M in future.  In addition, the project entails (b) systematic introduction of efficient O&M on about 700,000 ha of irrigated land and 87,000 ha of swamp land; (c) completion of about 40 priority, GOI-funded on-going projects, selected on the basis of agreed technical and economic criteria; (d) pilot groundwater development through construction of some 900 tubewells for small farmers in primarily rainfed areas; and (e) support for policy reforms and institutional strengthening and training.  Lastly, the undertaking involves (f) technical assistance and studies in support of the above components."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"234,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007234556","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007234556","DocDate":"31-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926085110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926085110","DocDate":"08-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042816053144","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042816053144","DocDate":"15-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042816040143","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042816040143","DocDate":"09-AUG-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042816072845","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042816072845","DocDate":"05-AUG-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040515213246","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040515213246","DocDate":"03-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926085019","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926085019","DocDate":"15-OCT-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
