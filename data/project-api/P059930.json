There are three project components. The first revitalizes farmer groups and the organization of farmer networks; builds capacity of farmers to participate in and to lead extension activities; and promotes participatory extension methods and provides media and technology support. The second component extends the introduction of institutional and management reforms at the district level; builds the capacity of extension staff in the participating districts; and strengthens the extension support and delivery systems in participating districts. The third component improves the extension policy, conducts special studies, strengthens central extension support systems including degree and non-degree training, and provides technical assistance and project management support."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":46},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"18,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BC,JB,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,79,78","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":46},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":34},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20051221173906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051221173906","DocDate":"25-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99091105544761","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99091105544761","DocDate":"05-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99072205161860","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99072205161860","DocDate":"29-JUL-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
