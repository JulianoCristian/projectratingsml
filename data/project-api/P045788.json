There are four components. The first constructs main highways, expressways, and rural roads to serve the poor counties of agricultural areas in three regions. This component constructs civil works, electrical and mechanical works including interchanges, tolling stations, service areas, and management stations as well as tolling, monitoring, telecommunications, and power supply and lighting systems. The second component improves roads, improving all-weather access to villages and towns through all-weather roads and provision of non-motorized transport. The third component strengthens the capacity of communications departments to plan, construct, operate, and maintain the proposed highways through training and the provision of critical and technically appropriate equipment. The fourth component funds a highway safety program, which increases cooperation between the traffic police and the communication departments; analyses traffic accidents; launches a pilot program to treat accident black spots; develops traffic safety manuals and safety audit procedures; and provides equipment, technical assistance, and training."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
