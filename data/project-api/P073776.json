It is the third Bank loan to support the Government of  India's (GOI) National Highway Development Program (NHDP), which aims to upgrade 13,000 km of  core national highways network by 2007. The first two loans, namely the Third National Highway Project (TNHP) (rep. no. 20219)and Grand Trunk Road Improvement Project (GTRIP) (rep. no. 22169), were approved in June 2000 and June 2001, respectively. All three projects finance the upgrading of National Highway 2 between Delhi and Kolkata and support institutional strengthening actions.  There are three project components.   Component 1, bypass construction, funds the construction of  the 84.7 km bypass, which is located at the northern outskirts of  Allahabad City. The bypass will be an access controlled highway, with a 1 km bridge over the Ganga River. Toll plazas and rest areas will also be provided. Component 2 funds corridor management. Specifically, the component will fund the procurement of  private operators under performance based contracts for the operations and maintenance of  Ahmedabad-Vadodra Expressway or selected national highway stretches, and the procurement and installation of  toll collection systems and automatic traffic management systems. Component 3, institutional strengthening, funds independent and periodic surveys of  road users and road sector stakeholders during the project period, to determine the level of  their awareness, involvement and satisfaction with the delivery, management and operation of  national highways by the National Highways Authority of India."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
