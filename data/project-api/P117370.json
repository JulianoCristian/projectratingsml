The PRSC is aligned with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Zambia for the period 2008-2011. The CAS identifies direct budget support as the primary instrument to assist Zambia in achieving its reform program and maximizing the impact of its poverty reduction strategy. The PRSC process also provides a forum for ongoing policy dialogue with the government and other major stakeholders; it promotes coordination between the government and the donor community and complements the continuing efforts of other cooperating partners. As a result, economic growth has not generated the expanded employment opportunities and increased income necessary for further poverty reduction. Zambia must successfully diversify growth across labor-intensive, pro-poor sectors if the country is to make significant progress in achieving its poverty reduction goals."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":37},"theme5":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":12},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Program Document","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"BE,YZ,LT,BC,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Economic management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"21,27,39,25,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,4,2,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":13},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20130626110747","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130626110747","DocDate":"24-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000356161_20110301000115","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110301000115","DocDate":"22-FEB-2011"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
