The extension is necessary to allow the Ministry of Economy and Investment of South Kordofan (acting on behalf of the project implementing entity, the Government of South Kordofan) to utilize counterpart funds in the amount of US$4.5 million committed by the Government of South Kordofan and additional funding to be presented soon in the amount of US$14 million and to complete planned activities to achieve the original project objectives. Progress reported by the State Government suggests that project activities will be completed in accordance with the revised action plan. The task team closely assisted the project coordination unit in formulating this action plan, and is satisfied that the indicated activities and time-frame are feasible and will result in the achievement of the intended project objectives."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Sudan!$!SD","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"7,880,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Crops"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Paper,Project Paper,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"SD","sectorcode":"AH,AJ,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000372654","geoLocName":"Lake Keilak","latitude":"10.84549","longitude":"29.33976","country":"SD"},{"geoLocId":"0000372655","geoLocName":"Keilak","latitude":"10.83016","longitude":"29.3461","country":"SD"},{"geoLocId":"0000373141","geoLocName":"Kadugli","latitude":"11.01111","longitude":"29.71833","country":"SD"},{"geoLocId":"0000408661","geoLocName":"Southern Kordofan State","latitude":"11.26667","longitude":"30.83333","country":"SD"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,62,79","mjthemecode":"10,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":35},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":35},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011102911374189","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011102911374189","DocDate":"29-OCT-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011020616581366","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011020616581366","DocDate":"06-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2010081116071188","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010081116071188","DocDate":"26-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000262044_20100712112020","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100712112020","DocDate":"12-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20100702001703","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100702001703","DocDate":"24-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333037_20100702001427","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100702001427","DocDate":"23-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000323596_2008111110214544","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000323596_2008111110214544","DocURL":"11-NOV-2008"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Sudan"}},"facets":{}}
