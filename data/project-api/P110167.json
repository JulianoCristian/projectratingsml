The transitional part of the TSC reflects the transitional nature of the political situation. The TSC will support a subset of the CTG's wide-ranging reform agenda, which is heavily focused on tackling critical and long-festering weaknesses in core governance functions. Notably, the reforms have sought to strengthen and enhance the autonomy of important institutions of accountability such as the election commission and the anti-corruption commission. Other measures have included separation of the lower judiciary from the executive, preparation of the right to information legislation, and formation of the regulatory reforms commission to streamline business processes. The CTG is also deepening economic reforms in a number of areas, including trade liberalization, macroeconomic stability, and strengthening public financial management and tax mobilization. The recently concluded joint damage, loss and needs assessment has outlined a long-term strategy that integrates structural and nonstructural interventions in light of the lessons learned from the natural disasters over last two decades. Central to this strategy is a long term disaster risk reduction framework which has five strategic pillars: (a) risk identification and assessment; (b) strengthening and enhancing emergency preparedness; (c) institutional and community capacity building; (d) risk mitigation investments; and (e) introducing catastrophe risk financing in the longer term."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Aviation","Percent":6},"sector5":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Aviation"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"CT,TV,BG,YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Economic management","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"45,43,27,21,32","mjthemecode":"3,1,2,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Aviation","code":"TV"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":6},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20100330225753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100330225753","DocDate":"30-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2008100310352677","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008100310352677","DocDate":"17-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2008100310352677","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008100310352677","DocURL":"17-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20080606031132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080606031132","DocDate":"08-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20080501131018","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080501131018","DocDate":"28-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20080501130933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080501130933","DocDate":"29-MAR-2008"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
