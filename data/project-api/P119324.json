At the conclusion of the ERSG IV-V programmatic series, tangible progress with respect to each component of the reform program is expected, including: (i) measurable improvements in public finance management; (ii) measurable improvements in the environment for private sector development, with a focus on improved performance of the energy sector; (iii) progress in the liberalization of the productive sector, including the execution of the reform program in the coffee sector; and (iv) measurable progress towards coping with the effects of an ongoing fuel and food crisis."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Burundi!$!BI","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Cinqui\u00e8me don d\u2019appui aux r\u00e9formes \u00e9conomiques au Burundi</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le cinqui\u00e8me Don d\u2019appui aux r\u00e9formes \u00e9conomiques (ERSG- V) est le deuxi\u00e8me d\u2019une s\u00e9rie programmatique de deux op\u00e9rations (la premi\u00e8re op\u00e9ration de la s\u00e9rie, soit ERSG IV, a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre 2010), destin\u00e9e \u00e0 aider le Gouvernement du Burundi (GB) \u00e0 consolider les efforts r\u00e9cents pour transformer l\u2019\u00e9conomie du Burundi d\u2019un contexte postconflit vers une \u00e9conomie orient\u00e9e sur le d\u00e9veloppement durable.
