The project components cover the three main areas (policy, institutional, and physical investments) of Poland's 1996-2000 Road Investment Program (RIP). The first component, policy, comprises 1) adequate maintenance and strengthening of high priority roads, including bridges, and winter maintenance, with adequate budgets; 2) review and adjustment of road user charge levels and distribution between different user groups to balance costs and revenues; 3) further action on the road axle-load policy; and 4) establishment of a leasing policy to enhance and speed up privatization of local contractors. The second component calls for: 1) further restructuring, privatization, and development of the road contracting industry, focusing on improving managerial, financial and technical capacity, and in establishing professional associations to enhance their competitiveness; 2) improving the coordination, collaboration, and operation of government agencies on the ongoing road safety program; and 3) assisting the vehicle inspection center. The third component, infrastructure, consists of: 1) rebuilding, upgrading, realigning, and resurfacing priority road sections and their crossings through cities; 2) rebuilding and upgrading 2 bridges, and building 3 new major bridges; 3) constructing 12 bypasses around congested cities; 4) emergency reconstruction of flood-damaged high priority infrastructure; 5) acquiring road maintenance and road safety equipment, vehicles, and materials; and 6) technical assistance and training for the ongoing road safety program in management, planning, pavement and maintenance systems, environmental protection, m"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Urban development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,78,71,27","mjthemecode":"2,9,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20060522085526","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060522085526","DocDate":"25-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2006061412574036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2006061412574036","DocDate":"27-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3971126124129","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971126124129","DocDate":"07-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182251","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3980429110140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980429110140","DocDate":"01-JAN-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland"}},"facets":{}}
