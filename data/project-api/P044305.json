The Chad portion of the project has four components. The first finances construction of field and export systems including drilling of production wells and water re-injection wells; infrastructure facilities comprising a central treating facility, electric power generation plant, an airfield and office buildings; a pipeline and pumping station; and infrastructure upgrades. The second component designs and implements a sound petroleum revenue management program. The third component supports private investment and commercial financing. The fourth implements an environmental management plan. There are three components for the Cameroon project segment. The first constructs an export system also, including pipeline, pumping stations, and a floating storage and offloading vessel as well as upgrades infrastructure. The second component encourages private investment and commercial financing, while the third component implements an environmental management plan."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
