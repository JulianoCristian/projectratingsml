There are three project components: 1) This component will finance sub-project grants for three programs. The first program will improve technical quality of rural water supply projects and other components as well. The second program will pay more attention to economic analysis in appraisal, using cost effectiveness ratios and benefit analysis. The third program will alter the policies and procedures governing subproject eligibility, appraisal, and supervision. 2) This component will support the costs of staffing, managing, monitoring, reporting, and operating the Social Fund of the Kingdom of Cambodia (SFKC). 3) A portion of the credit will be set aside as unallocated to facilitate adjustments to out year disbursement category management."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Cambodia!$!KH","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Irrigation
