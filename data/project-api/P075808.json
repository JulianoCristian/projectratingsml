Through its two main components, the project will: 1) Improve program quality, aiming at the reform of the educational dimension of programs in the \"campagne generale,\" a broad initiative run by nongovernmental organizations, government departments, private industries, and local groups. To this end, curriculum content, and teaching methods will be reviewed, analyzed, and renovated, to improve learner participation, and performance. 2) Strengthen management of the educational system, by building the institutional capacity of the Program Management Division - DLCA - of the Literacy Department, essentially the provincial Literacy Coordinators of the Ministry of Labor, Vocational Training, Social Development and Solidarity, and of service providers. This will be achieved through a partnership-based approach, with measures that include training of government, and service provider personnel, as well as development of post-literacy strategies. The project will pursue regular evaluation of outcomes, and analysis of different aspects of the Literacy programs, so as to prepare to take successful innovations of scale."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"4,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"BC,EL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"59,65","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":80},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080808011259","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080808011259","DocDate":"05-AUG-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201511311","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201511311","DocURL":"07-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201511311","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201511311","DocDate":"07-FEB-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02100104010041","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02100104010041","DocDate":"12-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000334955_20090909042301","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090909042301","DocDate":"12-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02011804102534","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02011804102534","DocDate":"21-AUG-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01110204024948","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01110204024948","DocDate":"19-AUG-2002"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
