The primary program objective is to improve living conditions and stimulate economic growth in the Comoros, while protecting the environment through investments in basic infrastructure. There are three project components. The first, the transport component, assists Comoros with improving its road maintenance, safety, and management through three subcomponents: national and regional roads periodic maintenance, roads safety, and institutional strengthening. Specifically, these subcomponents will rehabilitate earthworks, including pothole repair, local reinforcement, resurfacing, and resealing; maintain and repair road shoulders, drainage works, and roadsides; finance the installation of traffic signals and signs and the stabilization of road embankments; and strengthen the capacity of the executing agency and privatize regional road maintenance centers, and provide technical assistance. The urban water supply component will support the rehabilitation and extension of urban water infrastructure, and support technical assistance to strengthen the management and operation of urban water utilities. The third component funds agency coordination and supports training on environmental management for government staff and others who design, implement, maintain, and operate project activities."},"country_namecode":"Union of the Comoros!$!KM","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":54},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":37},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"11,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"KM","sectorcode":"BC,WC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Urban development","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"78,71,26,39","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":54},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":37},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000160016_20031209114219","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20031209114219","DocDate":"31-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01021405375480","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01021405375480","DocDate":"02-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99081506041482","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99081506041482","DocDate":"22-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00102005304296","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00102005304296","DocDate":"31-DEC-1999"}],"countryname":"Union of the Comoros","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
