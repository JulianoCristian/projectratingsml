Specifically, the project through ABC would use project funds to provide subloans to households, cooperatives, collective enterprises, state-owned enterprises and state-collective partnerships for investments in tree crops, livestock, aquaculture and agro-processing.  This lending would be in six of China's poorer provinces: Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan in the southwest and Anhui, Henan and Hubei in the north central region.  The project's technical assistance component for institutional development would be used to strengthen ABC's  in-house staff training capability, and to conduct studies of ABC and the Rural Credit Cooperative (RCC) operations.  The focus of this institutional development program is to assist in the Government's effort to reshape ABC's role consistent with the ongoing reform of the financial system."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u7b2c\u4e09\u519c\u6751\u4fe1\u8d37\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u65e8\u5728\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u4fe1\u8d37\u523a\u6fc0\u519c\u4e1a\u589e\u957f\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u7ecf\u8425\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5236\u5ea6\u5efa\u8bbe\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u8bb2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u8be5\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5229\u7528\u9879\u76ee\u8d44\u91d1\uff0c\u5411\u519c\u6237\u3001\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u3001\u96c6\u4f53\u4f01\u4e1a\u3001\u56fd\u6709\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u96c6\u4f53\u8054\u8425\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b50\u8d37\u6b3e\uff0c\u8d44\u52a9\u679c\u6811\u6216\u8c46\u7c7b\u4f5c\u7269\u683d\u57f9\u3001\u755c\u7267\u517b\u6b96\u3001\u6c34\u4ea7\u517b\u6b96\u548c\u519c\u4ea7\u54c1\u52a0\u5de5\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u516d\u4e2a\u8f83\u8d2b\u56f0\u7701\u4efd\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u897f\u5357\u5730\u533a\u7684\u8d35\u5dde\u3001\u56db\u5ddd\u548c\u4e91\u5357\u4e09\u7701\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2d\u5317\u90e8\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5b89\u5fbd\u3001\u6cb3\u5357\u548c\u6e56\u5317\u4e09\u7701\u3002\u6280\u672f\u63f4\u52a9\u5b50\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5f00\u5c55\u5236\u5ea6\u5efa\u8bbe\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u5bf9\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u57f9\u8bad\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u5c55\u5173\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u519c\u6751\u4fe1\u7528\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u8fd0\u8425\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5236\u5ea6\u5efa\u8bbe\u6d3b\u52a8\u65e8\u5728\u534f\u52a9\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u6309\u7167\u73b0\u884c\u91d1\u878d\u4f53\u5236\u6539\u9769\u8981\u6c42\u8c03\u6574\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u804c\u80fd\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"170,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008044328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008044328","DocDate":"21-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120340368","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120340368","DocURL":"29-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120340368","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120340368","DocDate":"29-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120340167","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120340167","DocURL":"29-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120340167","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120340167","DocDate":"29-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08236_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08236_1_0","DocDate":"26-JAN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926134019","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926134019","DocDate":"28-DEC-1987"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
