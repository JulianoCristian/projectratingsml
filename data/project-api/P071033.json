The project is expected to cover about 2,700 existing tank systems in nine districts of Karnataka, instead of an estimated original scope of 2,000 tank systems. This increase is possible due to lower than expected investments per tank and gains in the SDR-US$ exchange rate, and despite a cancellation of SRD 16.58 million on June 30, 2005, which reduced the project credit amount from SDR 80 million to SDR 63.42 million. The cancelled amount was reallocated towards the Tsunami Emergency Reconstruction Project. Besides this increase in number of tanks, there are no changes to the project development objective, design, and scope of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
