The project has the following three components: Component 1) Promotion of sustainable growth in agricultural production. Under this component, the project finances (a) productive investments to promote processing, and marketing of farm and livestock products. The project finances demand-driven productive investments proposed by producer organizations and the technical assistance required for proper implementation, through a grant system with an up-front farmers' contribution of at least 20% of subproject cost as defined in the Project Implementation Manual, and (b) competitive research as demand-driven subprojects to support short-term (two to three years) applied research aimed at finding solutions to constraints on the productive investment subprojects, both cotton and non-cotton-related. The project complements support from the French Cooperation Agency and ADB. It finances small equipment, inputs, operational costs for the implementation of subprojects, training and study tours, and activities that support effective development of linkages between small farmers and agribusiness. Component 2) will finance jointly with French Cooperation Agency and ADB, (a) capacity strengthening of producer organizations, including cotton producer organizations; (b) specific support to cotton sector reform; and (c) public and private sector development. Component 3) supports: (a) the administration and management of the project, and (b) the monitoring and evaluation of project activities. The component finances the small works and equipment required to establish a National Project Coordination and Management Unit (NPCMU) and six Inter-Regional Coordination and Management Unit"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme4":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Resettlement Plan,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Resettlement Plan,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"TD","sectorcode":"YA,AH,AI,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Rural development","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"48,78,76,77","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,10,10,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":60},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":20},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20110810010157","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110810010157","DocDate":"25-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20031119112506","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20031119112506","DocDate":"11-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_02121004054029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02121004054029","DocDate":"30-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02112604013717","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02112604013717","DocDate":"20-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01112904013812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01112904013812","DocDate":"11-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.2","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000012009_20050209121516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050209121516","DocDate":"01-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000012009_20050209112139","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050209112139","DocDate":"01-NOV-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chad","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
