The components include: 1) the development of micro-enterprises to reduce unemployment in rural areas, and allow a comparison of the micro-credit approach, with the current cost of social assistance. Off-farm self-employment will be promoted, through the financing of grants covering social insurance premiums, micro-loans for rural micro-enterprises, advisory services for these enterprises, and technical assistance provision; 2) labor redeployment, through the financing of economic, and labor market surveys, and labor redeployment services. Education financing will improve the quality of teaching, of school equipment, and will support instructional computerization, while institutional development, training programs, and capacity building will strengthen local, and regional administrations; and, 3) technical infrastructure in rural areas, to stimulate private sector investments, facilitate the creation of non-farm jobs, and introduce market-oriented approaches in developing infrastructure networks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":23},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"120,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"FE,BH,TA,WC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"41,26,76,77","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,10,2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":23},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":23},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000011823_20060120161733","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000011823_20060120161733","DocDate":"09-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911060837","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911060837","DocDate":"03-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00032505302294","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00032505302294","DocDate":"11-APR-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
