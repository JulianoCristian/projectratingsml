The project will be implemented as a comprehensive program of capacity building, by improving the quality, impact, and sustainability of service provision schemes. Project components include: 1) provision of grants for the implementation of service delivery projects, to be implemented by lead NGOs, and Partnership Grant Managers, in partnership with smaller NGOs. These projects will target marginalized communities, through a mix of sectoral/regional, and community-based projects, to be implemented over a period of two years. Technical assistance (TA), and organizational capacity building will be provided as needed; 2) provision of grants by NGOs, and Development Grant Recipients (DGR), for implementation of projects, provided ability to manage quality projects was demonstrated during Phase I of the project. Grants awarded to DGRs will represent incremental support, which will significantly contribute to sustain project activities financed under Phase I of the project; 3) the Sector Support Program, to provide technical expertise at the sectoral level, and will promote information exchange, elaborate stronger sector's role in development, and, promote a dialogue for enhancing public, and nongovernmental service delivery programs; and, 4) TA, and monitoring and evaluation, to support capacity gaps in managerial areas of the partnership/development grants programs, and, to conduct overall program evaluations."},"country_namecode":"West Bank and Gaza!$!GZ","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GZ","sectorcode":"JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"87,51,58,57","mjthemecode":"7,7,6,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070504153443","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070504153443","DocDate":"03-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052416211723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052416211723","DocDate":"12-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060704095557","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060704095557","DocDate":"24-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01030107595476","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01030107595476","DocDate":"20-FEB-2001"}],"countryname":"West Bank and Gaza"}},"facets":{}}
