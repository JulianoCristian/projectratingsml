The project has three main components. The first component is an investment component aimed at protecting the existing infrastructure from decay and developing additional urgently needed social infrastructure. The program of labor intensive subprojects includes two types of operations: (a) public works including routine maintenance of roads, rehabilitation of drainage system; and urban infrastructure; and (b) public services, notably cleaning up spoiled urban areas as well as testing private management practices of waste collection. The second component is capacity building through training and technical support for the beneficiaries and small- and medium-sized enterprises aimed at: (a) enhancing the technical capacity of domestic construction contractors and local consultants; (b) improving the management of public infrastructure by local governments, and emphasizing maintenance of new construction; and (c) improving public procurements and contract management practices. The third component is a study component aimed at defining more broadly-based improvements in the urban infrastructure maintenance management; and the private sector participation as a support of the project in general and the preparation of the urban environment project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of The Gambia!$!GM","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"11,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"GM","sectorcode":"BC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Urban development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"74,73,57,27,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,7,9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":60},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121193912","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121193912","DocURL":"11-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121193912","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121193912","DocDate":"11-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121194113","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121194113","DocDate":"11-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121194113","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121194113","DocURL":"11-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b308_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b308_1_0","DocDate":"14-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b307_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b307_1_0","DocDate":"14-DEC-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of The Gambia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
