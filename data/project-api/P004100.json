It would promote a more competitive price formation mechanism by introducing auction sales, and foster reduction in marketing costs by shortening distribution channels, by reducing intra-market congestion, and by building the new market in a readily accessible location on the outskirts of Seoul. Realization of the project benefits will depend on improved standards of wholesale market management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902391389","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902391389","DocDate":"31-MAR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e9737a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9737a_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97374_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97374_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAR-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
