Its three main objectives will be to: (a) review instruments and related measures; (b) strengthen technology infrastructure and metrology services; and (c) expand and improve the specialized financing program of Fondo de Equipamiento Industrial (FONEI). These objectives will be achieved through five components. They include (i) industrial technology development analysis; (ii) strengthening of technology infrastructure; (iii) strengthening of metrology services; (iv) specialized finance for technology development investments of industrial enterprises; and (v) institutional strengthening of FONEI. The project will help accelerate industrial technology innovation, thereby helping private firms compete in domestic and export markets. Increased availability of funds on terms suitable for industrial technology development, selective use of Government subsidy, and improved assistance in identification and formulation of subprojects, are expected to result in more, larger, or earlier technological improvements in participating firms."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"48,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006230736","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006230736","DocDate":"30-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165349","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165349","DocDate":"31-JUL-1986"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
