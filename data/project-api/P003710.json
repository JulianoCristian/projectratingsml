The project will principally consist of the establishment and operation of: (i) a National Seeds Corporation (NSC) which will develop a mechanized and irrigated seed farm on part of the Government-owned Sukamandi area in West Java and be responsible for production, processing and marketing of seed; (ii) a semi-autonomous plant breeding station at Sukamandi as a branch of the Central Research Institute of Agriculture (CRIA) to ensure an adequate flow of high yielding plant varieties to support the NSC's seed production program; and (iii) a seeds control and certification service. Appropriate seeds legislation will be promulgated to establish standards for seed purity and certification."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"7,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de2fd8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de2fd8_1_0","DocDate":"11-MAY-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903182549","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903182549","DocDate":"30-APR-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903203459","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903203459","DocDate":"30-APR-1971"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
