It will also help finance consulting services for supervision of civil works, to prepare future highway rehabilitation and to develop a bridge improvement program, and technical assistance to strenghthen transport planning. The project has the dual objective of improving the integration of the northern area of the country and the links from neighboring Brazil to Montevideo, Uruguay's capital and major port, and setting in motion an institutional effort to strenghthen long-term programming and executing capacity of road rehabilitation and reconstruction as well as of transport planning and coordination. The procurement phase of the project presents no special risks. Past experience with similar projects in Uruguay shows that delays in project implementation of one or two years were common, mainly because of inadequate project management. To help overcome this problem, the proposed project includes strenghthening of civil works supervision by an experienced consultant firm."},"country_namecode":"Oriental Republic of Uruguay!$!UY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"26,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"UY","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000333038_20081110021506","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081110021506","DocDate":"10-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902324185","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902324185","DocDate":"30-APR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912431915","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912431915","DocDate":"30-APR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e487_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e487_1_0","DocDate":"17-APR-1979"}],"countryname":"Oriental Republic of Uruguay"}},"facets":{}}
