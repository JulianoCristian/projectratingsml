St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis are the first of the OECS countries to join the program. There are three main project components. The first increases equitable access and equity in secondary education, particularly in poor rural communities, by constructing a new secondary school in St. Kitts and providing equipment, furniture, and materials; and expanding the school meals program in secondary schools. The second component comprises 4 subcomponents, which 1) develop curriculum for Forms i-III and provide instructional guides, textbooks, ad other resource materials; train trainers/educators in select areas, including fellowships, and development of a coordinated teacher appraisal system; 2) establish learning resource centers, and expand and upgrade learning centers, including science and information technology labs; 3) elaborate program to support participation of disadvantaged students, and related teacher development in special education; and, 4) provide school-based improvement projects, and extra-curricular activities. The third component expands the education management information system, including networking of schools and EMIS training."},"country_namecode":"St. Kitts and Nevis!$!KN","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":64},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"KN","sectorcode":"BC,ET,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,57,66,65","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":64},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000350881_20100125101614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20100125101614","DocDate":"29-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031616254286","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031616254286","DocDate":"26-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20031111091449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20031111091449","DocDate":"15-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02091205205191","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02091205205191","DocDate":"28-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02041004080719","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02041004080719","DocDate":"30-NOV-2001"}],"countryname":"St. Kitts and Nevis"}},"facets":{}}
