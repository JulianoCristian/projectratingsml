This telecommunications project is intended to eliminate these constraints by rehabilitating key parts of the telecommunications network, and to maximize capacity utilization by removing bottlenecks and imbalances. A further objective is the institutional development of TPTC (Tanzanian Posts and Telecommunications Corporation).  To this  end, the proposed project comprises TPTC's 1986-1990 Investment Program including (a) rehabilitation of local cable networks and subscriber equipment; (b) marginal expansion and replacement of worn out or obsolete switching and transmission equipment; and (c) installation of transit exchanges and a satellite earthstation.  The project also provides for (d) upgrading maintenance facilities; (e) upgrading computer facilities and (f) strengthening TPTC's organizational structure and management systems."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"23,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"CC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","code":"CC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120293170","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120293170","DocURL":"16-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120293170","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120293170","DocDate":"16-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120293371","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120293371","DocURL":"16-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120293371","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120293371","DocDate":"16-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36c0f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36c0f_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36c0c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36c0c_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926072957","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926072957","DocDate":"07-MAY-1987"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
