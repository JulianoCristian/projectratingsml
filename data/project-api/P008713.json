This will be accomplished through construction of an irrigation and drainage system and related facilities. The project works will include construction of two main pumping stations, 60 repumping and pressure pumping stations and a storage lake. Distribution networks, soil reclamation and valley training will also be included. About 114 km of 110 kv and 20 kv power lines together with related transformer substations will be constructed to supply energy to the pumping stations. Equipment for operation and maintenance of irrigation and drainage works and farm machinery to intensify agriculture on the area to be irrigated will be supplied. The project is expected to increase the gross production value in the project area from a fluctuating annual average of about $35 million equivalent to a relatively stable annual average of about $83 million. Yield increases in various crops will range from 40 percent to over 210 percent and cropping intensity will increase about 19 percent."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e958f4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958f4_1_0","DocDate":"22-JAN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e958f3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958f3_1_0","DocDate":"22-JAN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902341482","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902341482","DocDate":"31-DEC-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191247583","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191247583","DocDate":"31-DEC-1979"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
