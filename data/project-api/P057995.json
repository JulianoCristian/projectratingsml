The proposed additional financing would help finance costs associated with some of the original Project activities which have experienced cost overruns. The additional financing would allow the Government to complete ongoing initiatives, thereby contributing towards the achievement o f the Project Development Objective (PDO) and the sustainability of the initiatives. Neither an expansion nor a scale-up of the original Project activities are proposed. The specific activities to be financed are the continuation of the: (i) establishment of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) and building local capacity in it s usage; (ii) establishment of the Gambia Revenue Authority (GRA) and strengthening its operational capacity; and (iii) streamlining of customs procedures and upgrading of the Automated System Customs Data Administration Information Technology (IT) System (ASYCUDA). The expected outcomes from these activities are improved public financial management, both for revenue and expenditures. Ongoing Project initiatives will become more effective and sustainable due to strengthened local capacity."},"country_namecode":"Republic of The Gambia!$!GM","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Paper,Procurement Plan,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GM","sectorcode":"FA,BG,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rule of law","Economic management","Economic management","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"28,22,23,32,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,3,1,1,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","code":"22"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090810002705","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090810002705","DocDate":"29-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20080305023829","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080305023829","DocDate":"12-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000021321_2008011609405119","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008011609405119","DocDate":"08-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000310607_20071011110834","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20071011110834","DocDate":"03-OCT-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20080521003316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080521003316","DocDate":"27-AUG-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201241954","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201241954","DocURL":"02-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01071404015070","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01071404015070","DocDate":"06-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99040606000846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99040606000846","DocDate":"23-MAR-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of The Gambia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
