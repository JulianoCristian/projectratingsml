This Rapid Response Program paper seeks approval of the Executive Directors to provide International Development Association (IDA) grant and credit in the amount of SDR 99.6 million (US$150 million equivalent) to the Republic of Malawi in support of its reform program. The program responds to an urgent request by the Government of Malawi (GoM) to support the ongoing macroeconomic stabilization program as well as measures which will mitigate the impacts of the wide range of reforms which are being currently implemented. Some of the key economic reforms include liberalizing Malawi's foreign exchange regime and significant fuel and power price adjustments to better cover costs of these essential commodities. The program is aligned with the ongoing Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and is also consistent with new World Bank Group CAS for Malawi (FY13-16) which is at an advanced stage of preparation. This document comprises an overview, which provides the context, rationale, and description of the program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Malawi \u2212 Subvention \u00e0 la Politique de d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019une intervention rapide</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>L\u2019objectif de d\u00e9veloppement du Programme d\u2019intervention d\u2019urgence du Malawi est de financer (i) l\u2019instauration et le maintien de la stabilit\u00e9 macro-\u00e9conomique et le r\u00e9tablissement du fonctionnement d\u2019une \u00e9conomie de march\u00e9 pour permettre un rebond rapide de la croissance et (ii) la protection des pauvres et des groupes les plus vuln\u00e9rables \u00e0 court terme tout en am\u00e9liorant la transparence des syst\u00e8mes de mise \u00e0 disposition.
