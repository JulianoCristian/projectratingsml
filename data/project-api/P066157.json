It is the Bank' assessment that a four month extension would be prudent to ensure the completion of all activities undertaken in the second round of the school improvement grants program and to allow loan proceeds to be fully disbursed. The Ministry of education and science has prepared an action plan for completion of the remaining activities reflecting the extension of four months. The plan has been closely reviewed by the Bank team during the supervision visit in the week of September 11, 2010 and has been found acceptable. There are no outstanding audits for this project. The World Bank concurred with borrower's request for one year extension dated March 31, 2009."},"country_namecode":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of!$!MK","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"theme1":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Brief,Brief,Brief,Brief,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MK","sectorcode":"BC,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"65,26","mjthemecode":"2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":40},{"Name":"Education","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20110801005922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110801005922","DocDate":"10-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20100927012923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20100927012923","DocDate":"23-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20100927012444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20100927012444","DocDate":"01-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150107125728","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150107125728","DocDate":"01-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150107132954","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150107132954","DocDate":"01-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150107132103","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150107132103","DocDate":"01-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150107130327","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150107130327","DocDate":"01-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004092715122375","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004092715122375","DocURL":"02-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20031210095506","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20031210095506","DocDate":"13-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060111504354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060111504354","DocDate":"10-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0206260400486","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0206260400486","DocDate":"21-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02062704164812","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02062704164812","DocDate":"21-JUN-2002"}],"countryname":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of"}},"facets":{}}
