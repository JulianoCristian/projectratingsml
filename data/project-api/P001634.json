The project also seeks to facilitate the expansion of regional trade, principally between Malawi and Tanzania and help develop Malawi's northern region.  With that in mind, the project includes improvement and rehabilitation of roads in Malawi and Tanzania; construction of dry-cargo and fuel storage transshipment facilities in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya in Tanzania; provision of fuel tank wagons  and tank containers to be used by Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) railway.  Further to this, the project provides for improvement of shipping services on Lake Malawi; construction of a border post and weighing station on the Malawi-Tanzania border; and related consultancies and technical assistance.  The project will benefit the entire population of Malawi through lower prices on a wide variety of imported products and through increased exports brought about by more competitive export prices."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other transportation","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"13,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other transportation"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"TY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other transportation","code":"TY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214134658","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214134658","DocDate":"06-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120343583","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120343583","DocURL":"06-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120343583","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120343583","DocDate":"06-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08251_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08251_1_0","DocDate":"23-FEB-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926034538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926034538","DocDate":"27-JAN-1988"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
