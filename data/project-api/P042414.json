In addition to providing specific actions in the targeted rural areas of the thirteen selected provinces, the project will amplify the impact of the other two projects under the SPP/BAJ. It will include the following components: 1) reinforcement of the National Agency for Labor Promotion's (Promotion Nationale) activities designed to alleviate poverty; 2) creation of institutional and technical tools needed to monitor and analyze social conditions and implementation of programs whose aim is to improve these conditions; and 3) assistance to a central government body to coordinate the various actions undertaken under the SPP and national social development strategy and to provide feedback to decisionmakers."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":79},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":21},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"28,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"BC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"51,61,54,76","mjthemecode":"10,6,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":79},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":21}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050523121646","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050523121646","DocDate":"07-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040615130815","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040615130815","DocDate":"03-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200241997","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200241997","DocURL":"27-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200242298","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200242298","DocURL":"27-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019161404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019161404","DocDate":"09-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
