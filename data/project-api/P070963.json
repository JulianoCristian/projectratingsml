The closing date has been extended from October 31, 2011 until December 31, 2013 to allow the government sufficient time to finalize all project activities. Proceeds have been reallocated largely because of the need to support carrying out student learning assessment on an enhanced sample of rural schools and the provision of feedback to the schools and operating costs, and the need to fund additional consultants supporting the provincial and national governments to implement the Project because it is being extended."},"country_namecode":"Argentine
