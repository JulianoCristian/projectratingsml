The first has five subcomponents: 1) It funds development and dissemination of clinical protocols and procedures, equipment, incremental costs, and health facility repair to help focus on providing systematic prenatal, obstetric, labor and delivery, and post-natal care; on improving well-child and new-born care; and on integrating sick child care for priority childhood illnesses. 2) It promotes pre-marital counseling and family health education materials. 3) It improves supervisory and monitoring support for maternal and child health services by funding management procedures and information systems. 4) It funds training including materials and equipment. 5) It provides a variety of poverty relief funds. The second component comprises four components, which improve and expand the policy environment to prevent and control STDs, improve interventions targeted at changing behavior and informing and educating the general public, improve the disease surveillance system, and improve management of blood transfusion services. The third component consists of project coordination and support."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
