Nonetheless, risks exist, namely: the uncertain political environment in the midst of a campaign for a presidential re-election; difficulty in controlling aggregate expenditure levels because of failure of key measures to contain them; institutional gaps that may remain after the public downsizing exercise, thus jeopardizing key roles, and responsibilities; external macroeconomic shocks; and, the current armed conflict."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"EZ,BG,BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Rule of law"],"themecode":"33,28,25,27,21","mjthemecode":"1,2,2,2,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":60},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20080623035431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080623035431","DocDate":"22-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060117174003","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060117174003","DocDate":"28-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010031816415704","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031816415704","DocURL":"04-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010031816415704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031816415704","DocDate":"04-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050304144257","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050304144257","DocDate":"25-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000090341_20050323132508","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050323132508","DocDate":"16-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20041018130159","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20041018130159","DocDate":"18-OCT-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
