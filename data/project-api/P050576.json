There are two main components. Component 1 establishes a national institutional framework to 1) deliver technical assistance for the design and evaluation of local multi-sectoral programs for low-income youth through the Ministry of youth and its collaborators (nongovernmental organizations, research organizations, foundations); 2) establish and operate a learning network to disseminate best practices; and 3) design and manage an evaluation system to monitor and assess results, and provide elements for scaling up. Component 2 supports the establishment of learning networks consisting of municipal committees which plan, implement, and disseminate best practice on the service integration schemes, and service provider agencies which deliver the new and/or improved services to low-income youth. Funded services include community and /or institutional support systems for education, employment promotion, health prevention and promotion, civic participation, cultural events, and conflict resolution and mediation skills."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":61},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government
