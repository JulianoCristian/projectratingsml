Main project outcomes will contribute to defend critical human development expenditure by the Government during the first year of the crisis; maintain the availability of critical economic inputs (particularly in rural areas), and support the economic recovery process; rehabilitate and create communal assets, using community labor within affected populations; and, provide income supplements, and protect private assets of affected populations. The main indicator of project impact would be reduced levels of out-migration of affected families from their homes. While the project will undoubtedly assist drought-affected populations through cash inputs, and macroeconomic stabilization, risks include weak management capacity, particularly at the community levels, which as stipulated, the use of existing, simple systems will be used to reach communities, and improve program impacts. Moreover, taking into consideration that the dependence on food aid among rural communities in food insecure areas, may be deepened, project aid in the provision of income, and infrastructure development, should support regeneration of productive assets."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Technical Annex,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"EZ,WZ,YA,JB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,55,68,52,54","mjthemecode":"6,6,8,6,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070816125432","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070816125432","DocDate":"22-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000310607_20071010095518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20071010095518","DocDate":"24-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051312002335","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051312002335","DocDate":"08-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_03031504133610","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03031504133610","DocDate":"06-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03040304022537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03040304022537","DocDate":"20-FEB-2003"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
