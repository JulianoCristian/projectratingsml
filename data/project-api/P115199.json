Like many other developing economies, Indonesia has had to cope with the immediate ripple effects of the turmoil and crisis of confidence that has disrupted the global financial system in the last few months, while at the same time preparing for an anticipated growth slowdown and continued tight liquidity in 2009. The government has responded proactively to the rapidly evolving situation and the Bank and other partners have assisted in and continue to support these efforts. The PESF represents an opportunity to provide enhanced support to an important client with a sustained record of prudent macroeconomic management and fiscal discipline at a time of increased stresses in global financial markets. The government has clearly indicated that it feels that the Bank's engagement on the policy dialogue is critical, both in terms of the substantive support provided as well as in terms of the signal it sends to the market and to Indonesia's bilateral and multilateral partners. At the same time, by helping Indonesia to meet its gross financing needs in the event that liquidity conditions do not ease, the PESF would ensure that Indonesia is able to maintain and even scale up public spending on critical infrastructure and human capital investments and social protection at a time when they are most likely to be needed."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":31},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":23},"sector4":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":21},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":34},"theme4":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":8},"theme5":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":8},"totalcommamt":"2,000,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"LS,FA,YZ,FZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Economic management","Trade and integration","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"29,45,24,40,42","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,4,1,5,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","code":"LS"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":31},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":23},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":23},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":15},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20120327003554","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120327003554","DocDate":"14-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2009111014153020","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009111014153020","DocDate":"04-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2009111014153020","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009111014153020","DocURL":"04-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20090210222217","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090210222217","DocDate":"02-FEB-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090203105218","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090203105218","DocDate":"14-JAN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090203101109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090203101109","DocDate":"16-DEC-2008"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
