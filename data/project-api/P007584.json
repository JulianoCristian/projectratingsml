The Chiapas Development Plan is designed to address the main constraints to the development of the State and to implement economic as well as social investments.  The areas of influence of the two proposed projects would fit well into the priority of the Chiapas Development Plan.  The proposed project would support the initial stages of this Plan through the execution of a rural roads construction, rehabilitation, improvement and maintenance program in coordination with other simultaneous social and economic development efforts. The project provides for:  (i) construction of about 1,000 km of rural roads; as well as (ii) rehabilitation and improvement of about 2,000 km of existing rural roads.  It furthermore includes (iii) consulting services and related technical support to carry out detailed engineering and to upgrade the administrative and implementation capabilities of the executing agency."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Rural roads","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"22,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Rural roads"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"TR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Rural roads","code":"TR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925213303","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925213303","DocDate":"01-MAR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702140219","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702140219","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
