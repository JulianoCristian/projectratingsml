It will provide for: (a) the installation of the second 400 MW generating set (Unit No. 2) at Suralaya with coal handling and ash disposal facilities for Unit No. 1 and Unit No. 2; (b) the construction of the 500 kV transmission lines from Suralaya to Semarang with 500 kV substations at Suralaya, Jakarta, Bandung and Semarang; (c) the provision of a simulator at Suralaya for the training of the operating staff; (d) the establishment of a Java system control center at Jakarta; and (e) the consulting services including training. No engineering risk is foreseen in the type of work involved in the project. Delays in land acquisition may occur. However, appropriate measures have been included in the project to prevent them. There is a possibility that coal may not be available from the Bukit Asam by the expected commission date of the Suralaya station, in which case it will be necessary to use fuel oil in the plant and the project has been designed to permit it."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"253,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e961fa_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961fa_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e961f8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961f8_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d0f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d0f_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902354045","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902354045","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912474277","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912474277","DocDate":"31-MAR-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
