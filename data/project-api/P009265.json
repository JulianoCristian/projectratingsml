Although included in the earlier project, Croatia will also participate with an improved road maintenance management component.  The project supports further development and rehabilitation of sections of the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH), rehabilitation of other primary routes, and improved road maintenance.  To that end, the project includes:  (i) a three year (1988-90) time-slice of the investment program of the ROs in Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Vojvodina; (ii) limited training and technical assistance and the provision of road monitoring equipment; (iii) a training program for the staff of ROs, maintenance enterprises and engineering institutions; and (iv) provision of equipment for road maintenance in Croatia. The main emphasis is on improvements and rehabilitation of the TYH in Vojvodina and Macedonia and the rehabilitation of other primary routes, including sections of the Adriatic Highway in Montenegro and Kosovo."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"68,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"007232806_2006112915192206","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007232806_2006112915192206","DocURL":"19-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"007232806_2006112915192206","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007232806_2006112915192206","DocDate":"19-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019182553","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019182553","DocDate":"27-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032216213107","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032216213107","DocDate":"30-SEP-1988"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
