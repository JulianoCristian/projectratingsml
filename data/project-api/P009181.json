Situated in one of the least developed yet most promising rural areas in the republic, the project will consist of the following components: (a) primary agricultural production: intensification of production of 12,000 individually-owned farms, extension of agricultural production on 9,500 hectares of the social sector land; (b) support services: an extension service, facilities to provide improved livestock and crop breeds and varieties, artificial insemination and machine repair services to individual farmers; and (c) agro-industries component: provision of processing capacity for meat, fruit, vegetables and barley. The project adopts an integrated approach, towards agriculture based on formal cooperation between the individual and social sectors. The individual sector will provide the bulk of the incremental growth of primary production while the social sector is expected to foster the growth of such production through provision of support services to individual farmers and diversify and expand processing facilities to absorb this produce. Incremental production under the project would consist of cereals, fruits, vegetables and livestock products."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"55,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925091517","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925091517","DocDate":"22-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e393_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e393_1_0","DocDate":"05-OCT-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e391_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e391_1_0","DocDate":"05-OCT-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e390_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e390_1_0","DocDate":"05-OCT-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902311932","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902311932","DocDate":"30-SEP-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912400376","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912400376","DocDate":"30-SEP-1978"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
