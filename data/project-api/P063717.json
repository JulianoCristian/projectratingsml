Component 2 has been divided into five complementary elements. The first focuses on implementation of maritime conventions and port state control. It identifies \"baseline\" conditions; identifies technical, commercial, institutional, and legal impediments to ratification; promotes ratification and recommends additional treaty protocols; establishes a regional system and the capacity for port state control; and prepares an assessment of self-financing mechanisms to reduce navigation risk and prevent and control maritime pollution. The second element formally establishes new traffic separation schemes and extends an existing one. The third element funds hydrographic surveys and navigation aids. The fourth element helps establish vessel traffic systems; and the fifth element assists oil spill prevention and management. Component 6, supporting integrated coastal zone management, has four complementary elements. It sets up a regional network of experts and funds workshops to enhance capability in ICZM; facilitates and expands information exchange, particularly the application of geographic information systems; helps implement model ICZM plans; and focuses on institutional capacities and applied training of personnel."},"country_namecode":"Red Sea and Gulf of Aden!$!5R","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":61},"sector2":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":39},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"5,610,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"5R","sectorcode":"TP,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"80,82,85,57,84","mjthemecode":"11,7,11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":61},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":39}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060117125333","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060117125333","DocDate":"29-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051810560697","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051810560697","DocDate":"21-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910534013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910534013","DocDate":"03-FEB-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911055924","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911055924","DocDate":"01-NOV-1998"}],"countryname":"Red Sea and Gulf of Aden"}},"facets":{}}
