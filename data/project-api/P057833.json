Project components include: The first component includes enforcement of emissions regulations for in-use vehicles, development of vehicular emissions and fuel standards, lubricant regulations, and pilots for vehicular pollution control. Control options will be discussed and developed with vehicle manufacturers to ease implementation. It should include improved quality of lube oil, pumpless lubrication, and regular engine maintenance. Alternative vehicular fuels such as compressed natural gas will be considered, and liquefied petroleum gas and diesel fuel emissions will be reduced, through enforcement of improved vehicular standards. A public awareness campaign will be conducted to raise the level of information and establish an environmental education program. The second component, essential air quality information and evaluation of pilot activities will include air quality monitoring in Dhaka, air quality laboratory upgrade, and four studies examining key issues affecting public health. The component includes provision of technical assistance, equipment supply, training, and the development of policies and strategies for quality assurance."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"4,710,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Social protection and risk management","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,82,74,55,73","mjthemecode":"9,6,9,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":55},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090106213200","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090106213200","DocDate":"23-NOV-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201151683","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201151683","DocURL":"09-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201151683","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201151683","DocDate":"09-AUG-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00090605390782","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00090605390782","DocDate":"25-JUL-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9903191107241","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903191107241","DocDate":"18-FEB-1999"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
