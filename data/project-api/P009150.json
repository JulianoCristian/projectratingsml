Only the first-class hotel will be open year-around. The site for the project is the small coastal promontory of Bernardin located to the west of the city of Portoroz and 1.5 km from the ancient walled city of Piran. Piran, an attraction in itself, offers a summer festival of traditional music and is within easy access by road and hovercraft from the major tourist centers of Trieste and Venice. As in Babin Kuk, the project concept of a nucleus hotel with annexes permits operational flexibility and offers potential economies. Management systems will be developed with the assistance of management consultants."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia!$!YU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other urban development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other urban development"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"YU","sectorcode":"UY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other urban development","code":"UY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903314658","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903314658","DocDate":"30-JUN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903184983","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903184983","DocDate":"30-JUN-1971"}],"countryname":"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"}},"facets":{}}
