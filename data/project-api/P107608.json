The restructuring will provide the recipient with an opportunity to cancel unused and uncommitted funds in the amount of SDR 732,772.86 from IDA Credit 46580 in the civil works category and reallocate funds of the IDA Grant H5200-KG between categories in amount of SDR 364,801.00 to cover expected overdraw in the civil works category based on final estimates by the Investment Project Implementation Group (IPIG) to address the increased cost of the contract OBI/AF2/CB-Cw-01 for rehabilitation of the Osh-Batken-Isfana road corridor (Nookat pass and sections of the corridor entering Osh city). The increase in civil works costs was due to the proposed upgrade of scope of works from asphalt overlay to full rehabilitation due to severe cracks and rutting of the existing pavement and the need to improve sustainability of investment in road infrastructure."},"country_namecode":"Kyrgyz Republic!$!KG","sector1":{"Name":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and
