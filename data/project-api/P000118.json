In support of Benin's population policy, the project will assist in the further development and expansion of the family planning program. The project will also support implementation of the three main reforms included in the national health sector strategy for the period 1995-1999. These reforms, aimed at improving the quality, coverage and efficiency of basic health services and at rendering the health system more accountable to the population are: 1) decentralization and strengthening of sector management and administration; 2) reconfiguration of the referral system and strengthening of its capacity to provide technical support services to primary health care and nutrition; and 3) expansion of the participation of multiple stakeholders, including beneficiaries, in the planning, implementation and evaluation of national health policy and programs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Benin!$!BJ","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"27,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BJ","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,67,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20030708155420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20030708155420","DocDate":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121262764","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121262764","DocURL":"02-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121262764","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121262764","DocDate":"02-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23e92_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23e92_1_0","DocDate":"30-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019100835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019100835","DocDate":"10-MAY-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Benin"}},"facets":{}}
