The focus would be on increased food crop production and improvements in coffee yields and quality. The project will include: (a) expansion and streamlining of Central Agricultural Cooperative Union of the Western Province (UCCAO) services, strengthening of cooperatives, modernization of coffee processing and marketing facilities; (b) provision of incremental inputs; and (c) supporting activities, including applied research, village water supply, feeder roads, soil conservation, reafforestation, bottomlands development, monitoring and evaluation. Technical assistance, fellowships and studies would also be provided. The project will support several key Government objectives: (i) reducing rural-urban income disparities and slowing down urban migration by raising smallholder productivity and improving rural living conditions; (ii) promoting national food self-sufficiency and generating additional export earnings; and (iii) decentralizing development by strengthening regional institutions."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cameroon!$!CM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"21,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CM","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99d02_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99d02_1_0","DocDate":"17-APR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99d00_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99d00_1_0","DocDate":"17-APR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902440460","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902440460","DocDate":"31-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901003751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901003751","DocDate":"31-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333037_20100324012941","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100324012941","DocDate":"29-MAR-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cameroon"}},"facets":{}}
