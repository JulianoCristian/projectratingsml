There are four project components. Component 1 re-orients education policy objectives and strategies through governance and administrative reform. The five sub-components consist of 1) a redefined vision and comprehensive integrated national education strategy; 2) revised governance, management, and decision-making mechanisms to achieve and support an education system that delivers basic skills, core emergencies, and essential learning for the knowledge economy; 3) an Education Decision Support System (EDSS) to facilitate efficient policy analysis and effective system management as well as to promote transparency; 4) comprehensive and coordinated educational research, policy analysis, and monitoring and evaluation activities; and 5) effective management and efficient coordination of educational investments directed towards reform efforts. Additionally, support will be provided to school-based innovations. Component 2 transforms education programs and practices for the knowledge economy. ITS three sub-components develop new curriculum and enhanced learning assessment; support the professional development of Ministry of Education personnel; and provide required resources to support effective learning. Component 3 is designed to ensure adequate provision of structurally safe school buildings and improved learning environment. The two sub-components replace structurally unsafe and overcrowded schools; and upgrade existing schools to support learning in the knowledge economy by providing computer and science labs. Component 4 promotes readiness for learning through early childhood education.
