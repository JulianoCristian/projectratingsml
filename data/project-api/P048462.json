The project consists of five components.  The agriculture component will finance the purchase of breeding cattle and provide an emergency supply of critically needed farm mechanization equipment.  The housing component will finance repairs to multi-story non-system built socially-owned apartment buildings.  The water and sanitation component will finance works to restore water supply and sewage services in 18 selected RS (Republika Srpska) municipalities.  The electric power component will finance repairs and rehabilitation to transmission lines and substations.  The implementation support component will finance the establishment and maintenance of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), which will implement the agriculture and housing components, and supervise ZVRS (Zavod za Vodoprivreda, RS) and Elektroprivreda RS in implementing the water and sanitation and electric power components."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":33},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Power","Percent":24},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"sector5":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"17,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Housing construction"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BA","sectorcode":"AZ,BC,LD,WZ,YC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,74,84,58,78","mjthemecode":"10,7,11,9,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":33},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":29},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":24},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000090341_20040409135523","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040409135523","DocDate":"19-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01072504014426","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072504014426","DocDate":"28-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123471823","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123471823","DocURL":"20-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123472528","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123472528","DocURL":"20-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3980203115416","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980203115416","DocDate":"31-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184028","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184028","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}},"facets":{}}
