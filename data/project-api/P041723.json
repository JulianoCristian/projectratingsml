The project has two 5-year phases and is supported through an Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The project has five main components in the first phase. The first component pilots a capital cost recovery mechanism; promotes private irrigation investments on large-scale schemes; improves irrigation infrastructure management; and promotes cost reduction by strengthening local private sector/nongovernmental organizational capacity. The second component sets up an autonomously managed road authority to conduct routine maintenance on the main network and feeder roads; and elaborates a national rural transport strategy. The third component helps construct water supply and sanitation facilities and provides community education activities. It also provides training to construct on-site sanitation systems for households, schools, and health centers; and improves sanitation conditions and hygienic practices. The capacity-building sub-component supports local governments, private sector/NGO providers, and public sector agencies. The fourth component implements environmental action plans. The fifth component sets up the agency for rural works and equipment (AGETIER)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":46},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":24},"sector3":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":16},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"115,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"BZ,TZ,WZ,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,57,39,78,83","mjthemecode":"11,10,4,7,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":46},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":24},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080805234027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080805234027","DocDate":"30-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123572332","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123572332","DocURL":"18-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200080657","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200080657","DocDate":"18-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200080456","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200080456","DocDate":"18-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123572533","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123572533","DocURL":"18-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00061705510769","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00061705510769","DocDate":"02-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00081005432369","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081005432369","DocDate":"31-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911050899","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911050899","DocDate":"19-MAY-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
