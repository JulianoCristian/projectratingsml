The project has four main components: 1) The participatory watershed development, and protection component will finance social mobilization, and institution building activities, to facilitate planning, and investment activities by local communities. Through an initial information dissemination, social and resource mapping will be conducted, to analyze gaps, evolving potential solutions, village transects, and a development plan. Physical treatment of sub-watersheds will be implemented, selected by the community, but within acceptable technical approaches. 2) Participatory farmer-driven research, and extension processes will be financed, to include a program of farm demonstrations, and farmer training, to introduce improved practices for agriculture, and horticulture. Moreover, silvi-pastoral treatments, extension improvement, and private participation in artificial insemination, and veterinary services will be included, in addition to capacity building, particularly in forestry-related institutions. Integrated pest management will be promoted through adaptive trials, and training. 3) The formation of beneficiary groups for additional income generation will be supported, through craft industries, carpentry, and other related enterprising. 4) Institutional strengthening will consist of: a) monitoring and evaluation, which includes additional environmental, and social assessments, and, the development of a geographic information system database; and, b) project management, and coordination."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":4},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"100,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Brief,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"BH,YW,AB,JB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,85,76,57","mjthemecode":"7,10,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":57},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":6},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":4},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000386194_20110722010551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110722010551","DocDate":"30-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000350881_20091016095551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20091016095551","DocDate":"28-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20080813234358","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080813234358","DocDate":"13-AUG-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000310607_20080227110543","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20080227110543","DocDate":"01-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01041811161346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01041811161346","DocDate":"31-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01041811161347","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01041811161347","DocDate":"31-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01060704095354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060704095354","DocDate":"29-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0010180533200","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0010180533200","DocDate":"03-NOV-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
