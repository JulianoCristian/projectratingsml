A secondary objective is that the new payments systems satisfy internationally accepted standards and core principles and thus ensure a high level of user confidence in the WAEMU financial systems. The project has five components: The project support component includes project management and monitoring, training, and procurement. The RTGS component establishes a real time gross settlement system at the regional level, which includes transaction monitoring, management of settlement accounts, management of transactions queues, exchange of information with participants, and intra-day liquidity management. The low value clearing component upgrades existing systems at the national and regional levels. The inter-bank card system develops a common bank card product, enabling use in any ATM or participating merchant's facility in the sub-region. The project includes a feasibility study on the use of e-money systems for small payments. For all three payments systems in this project, the BCEAO's telecommunications satellite network would be used to effect transactions with a degree of security and at low cost."},"country_namecode":"Africa!$!3A","sector1":{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":21},"theme1":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"9,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"3A","sectorcode":"CT,FA,FG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,34,42,47","mjthemecode":"5,4,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","code":"FG"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":57},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":22},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":21}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080704052903","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080704052903","DocDate":"29-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00051805410725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051805410725","DocDate":"16-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0010130548113","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0010130548113","DocDate":"26-SEP-2000"}],"countryname":"Africa"}},"facets":{}}
