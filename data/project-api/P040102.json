Achieving this objective will help Colombia to improve the quantity and quality of its infrastructure services through the development of an effective policy, regulatory framework, and adequate practices. The project will finance studies, consulting services, and training and equipment; ensure a consistent and effective legal and regulatory framework, including the environmental regulatory framework; and promote private participation and competition by addressing specific issues and removing constraints. The privatization component will identify and develop projects for potential private participation, structure deals, design model bidding documents and implement demonstration projects in priority sectors; develop models to make bidding procedures efficient and transparent; help develop institutional capacity within sector agencies to structure projects suitable for private participation; prepare environmental audits and evaluations for existing installations identified as having significant environmental impact; and carry out marketing and information dissemination activities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Power","Percent":14},"sector3":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"12,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"CT,WC,LD,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"44,40,43,34","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"3,4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":70},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":14},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":9},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050303102953","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050303102953","DocDate":"28-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183127","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200295126","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200295126","DocURL":"04-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200295126","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200295126","DocDate":"04-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3970625093823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625093823","DocDate":"31-JAN-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
