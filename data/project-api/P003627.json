It will assist institutional and infrastructure development in grain commodity markets where prices will be determined by market forces, and facilitate the expansion and improved efficiency of China's domestic and international grain trade through investments in critical infrastructure - in grain storage, bulk and bagged handling, and transport facilities - in four major grain production and/or consumption locales in the Northeast, Yangtze River area, Southwest, and the Beijing area.  The project will finance works, upgrading, and equipping of bulk handling facilities for five major grain port terminals, about 60 intermediate grain depots, about 300 primary grain depots, more than 1,400 bulk rail wagons, over 1,000 bulk trucks, 10 bulk grain vessels, and computers and telecommunications equipment for two wholesale/future markets, two training centres, and a Grain Marketing Information Center.  A substantial training and technical assistance component will support:  (a) design work, construction supervision, operation and commissioning of the grain handling facilities; and (b) implementation of the market development, Information Center, and Training Center component and policy reform aspects of the project."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
