The project will include the following components: 1) building of three large loading stations for septage disposal at sea under a private collection and disposal contract; 2) building of a pilot septage treatment plant; 3) rehabilitation of the Central and the Ayala sewerage systems, the Ayala treatment plant, and construction of about 10,000 individual sewer connections; and 4) provision of maintenance equipment, tools, spare parts and laboratory instruments.  Implementation support will include: 1) construction supervision and environmental monitoring and management assistance; 2) preparation of designs and documents for the follow-up expansion of the sewerage system and septage treatment plants; and 3) preparation of documents for the Third Manila Water Supply Project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the
