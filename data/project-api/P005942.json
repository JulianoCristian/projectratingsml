The project's main components include: (a) a refinery conversion scheme to convert annually a total of about 4.2 million tons (28 million barrels) of fuel oil from the La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo refineries to about 3.9 million tons (26 million barrels) of higher-value distillates and coke; (b) a plant operations improvement program; (c) a financial management improvement program; (d) a training program; and (e) an industrial energy audit of the major industrial enterprises in Argentina. The project enables Argentina to reduce imports of light and middle distillates; it will also strengthen YPF's internal management and help increase operational efficiency. The project faces no major risks, although possible commissioning problems and difficulties in initially attaining and maintaining a high operating rate cannot be ruled out."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"GS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","code":"GS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925065434","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925065434","DocDate":"01-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902380344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902380344","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191252417","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191252417","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
