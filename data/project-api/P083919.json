This will be achieved by supporting the integration of selected neighborhoods into the urban fabric of the capital city through carrying out reconstruction and rehabilitation of urban infrastructure and enhancing the managerial capacity of the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing (MUDH) and the Kabul Municipality (KM). The benefits flowing from the project will be measured both in terms of improved services in selected neighborhoods in Kabul and enhanced managerial capacity of the executing agencies. In Kabul upwards of 250,000 people will have access to basic urban services at a level not seen for 23 years. At the institutional level, both MUDH and KM will benefit from technical assistance and training designed to improve capacity to undertake their mandatory tasks. Risks include: 1) a deterioration in the security situation and a possible delay in the economic revitalization of  the country; 2) lack of  implementation capacity caused by many government staff having left or having not been exposed to modem technological developments; 3) logistical constraints including unreliable transportation, lack of accommodation and poor communications coupled with the security situation; and 4) potential tension between ethnic groups. The first risk is outside the scope of the project to control. The second and third risks are manageable with close supervision. The fourth risk will be mitigated through the unbiased selection of upgrading areas. The Credit is expected to be fully disbursed over a 48-month period."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection
