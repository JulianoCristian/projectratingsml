It would finance on-farm investment, incremental production inputs and technical assistance for: (i) approximately 2,570 small farmers who--either individually or as members of cooperatives--own 12 basic ha of land or less. A minimum of one third of the project's lending program would be earmarked for their use; (ii) about 750 medium-sized farmers and ranchers; and (iii) an estimated 90 agroindustrial enterprises. The project faces no special risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"36,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925045457","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925045457","DocDate":"22-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e95efc_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e95efc_1_0","DocDate":"09-SEP-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902360795","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902360795","DocDate":"31-AUG-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912481944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912481944","DocDate":"31-AUG-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile"}},"facets":{}}
