The operation will support a strategic set of policy reforms in private sector development, public sector management and social service delivery. The operation will also provide continuity of the reform initiated by the Bank's previous adjustment operations (SAC 1 and 2). Policy measures supported by this operation have a strong cross cutting emphasis on improving governance. The program is divided into two pillars with the following components: Pillar 1, Promoting Private Sector Development, is comprised of: Component 1, maintaining macroeconomic stability; Component 2, improve investment climate through reform of licensing and inspections, increasing transparency of the privatization process and promoting market competition; and Component 3, reforming regulatory frameworks through separating policy making and regulation function in key strategic sectors (i.e. aviation, cotton and energy). Pillar 2, Improving Public Sector Management and Public Service Delivery, is comprised of Component 1, public sector management reform through restructuring core public institutions, reforming civil service management and the wage system, strengthening the medium-term expenditure framework; and Component 2, improving social service delivery in health and education."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Aviation","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":13},"sector5":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Aviation"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General energy sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Agreement,Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"TJ","sectorcode":"LZ,JA,TV,YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Rural development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,47,77,27,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,10,5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Aviation","code":"TV"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":23},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":14},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":13},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20100503033256","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100503033256","DocDate":"23-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333038_20080602032941","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080602032941","DocDate":"12-OCT-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"007037413_2006101115070613","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007037413_2006101115070613","DocDate":"27-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"007037413_2006101115070613","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=007037413_2006101115070613","DocURL":"27-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20060616122237","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060616122237","DocDate":"15-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000090341_20051201134027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20051201134027","DocDate":"18-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050411104619","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050411104619","DocDate":"23-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20050413134450","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050413134450","DocDate":"23-MAR-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tajikistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
