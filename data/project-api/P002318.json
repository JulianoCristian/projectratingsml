This will be achieved through crop development activities, and by strengthening and support of existing rural development institutions, improvements in applied research, training of extension workers, and rehabilitation of essential rural infrastructure. The project's main quantifiable benefit would derive from expected incremental production of cotton, food crops and livestock products. Unquantifiable benefits would include better financial management of Cotton Development Agency (SODEFITEX), enhancement of its capability to plan and implement development activities, and social benefits from the research, maize-processing, village health, and water supply components."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"16,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925160952","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925160952","DocDate":"24-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000333038_20090219040007","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090219040007","DocDate":"24-NOV-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05db6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05db6_1_0","DocDate":"02-AUG-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05db4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05db4_1_0","DocDate":"02-AUG-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101320","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101320","DocDate":"31-JUL-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901014067","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901014067","DocDate":"31-JUL-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333037_20100324020857","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100324020857","DocDate":"08-JUL-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
