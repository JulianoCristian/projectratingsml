The project comprises: (a) construction of 38 new wells; (b) repair of 102 existing wells; (c) establishment of two units to maintain 821 wells in the main livestock producing areas; and, (d) strengthening of the Livestock Development Unit established by UNDP in 1969. The project would play a very important part in the Government's efforts to boost its livestock industry and, thereby, increase its foreign exchange earnings. The estimated foreign exchange cost of the project is about $2 million, of which the proposed total credit would finance about $1.6 million and the UNDP about $0.4 million. The IDA would in addition finance about $0.6 million of local costs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"2,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TD","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912534310","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912534310","DocDate":"12-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902181570","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902181570","DocDate":"29-FEB-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de309d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de309d_1_0","DocDate":"15-FEB-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dec535_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dec535_1_0","DocDate":"15-FEB-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903201325","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903201325","DocDate":"24-JAN-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000386194_20111223014721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20111223014721","DocDate":"24-JAN-1972"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chad"}},"facets":{}}
