The proposed credit is the first structural adjustment operation to support policy and institutional reforms as outlined in the new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was discussed by the Board on March 9, 2004. At that time Zambia was judged to be in the low case scenario of the CAS. Since the discussion at the Board, improvements have been made in macroeconomic management as reflected by conclusion of an IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) plus progress towards HIPC completion and key governance issues."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"CT,LZ,BE,FZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Economic management","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,23,43,38,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,4,4,1,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":10},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070116100840","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070116100840","DocDate":"28-DEC-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000160016_20051221184001","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051221184001","DocDate":"14-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010031116064087","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031116064087","DocURL":"16-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000090341_20041119132408","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041119132408","DocDate":"12-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20040526155332","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040526155332","DocDate":"18-APR-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
