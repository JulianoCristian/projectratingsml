The project has two components: 1) water resources management, to provide the necessary technical and financial resources to strengthen the State of Bahia's basins and user level institutions to effectively manage water resources; and 2) infrastructure investments, to finance the construction and rehabilitation of water resources storage and distribution infrastructure in the Itapicuru River Basin."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":66},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"51,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"JB,BH,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,78,85,57,82","mjthemecode":"11,7,11,10,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":66},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20060726145050","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060726145050","DocDate":"28-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200335290","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200335290","DocURL":"04-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200334988","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200334988","DocURL":"04-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184317","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184317","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980313101622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980313101622","DocDate":"20-AUG-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3981005100144","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3981005100144","DocDate":"30-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3981005100142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3981005100142","DocDate":"30-APR-1997"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
