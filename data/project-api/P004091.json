The project has been designed to reach out into communities with primary care services, particularly maternal and child health and family planning, identifying those most at risk and referring them to facilities for more specialized care. The major components are: (a) improving the delivery of health and family planning services by strengthening and expanding the delivery network; (b) increasing demand for services by strengthening and expanding information, education and communication activities in health and family planning; and (c) improving the program's evaluation and administration capacities. The principal beneficiaries will be mothers and children, primarily in rural areas, who do not now have access to services. It is estimated that about 10 million people would be provided primary health care services under the project thus lowering fertility, mortality and morbidity. The age structure of the population and the lack of responsiveness of the women, particularly in rural areas, to the programs proposed could jeopardize the efforts to attain the goals of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Targeted health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Targeted health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"HT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Targeted health","code":"HT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924222703","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924222703","DocDate":"29-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924222622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924222622","DocDate":"25-OCT-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e958c3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958c3_1_0","DocDate":"11-DEC-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902335754","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902335754","DocDate":"30-NOV-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912472449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912472449","DocDate":"30-NOV-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
