The Project objectives are to: (1) have a modest though quick impact on the incomes of some of the poor; and (2) develop capacity at the national and local level to implement participatory approaches to poverty alleviation.  The Project's two components are: scaling-up of on-going nongovernmental organization poverty alleviation programs; and developing the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund (TASIF). The first component further consists of: (1) assisting returned families in the self-help reconstruction of their homes ; (2) expanding existing services and extending activities of the micro-credit program to other districts; (3) strengthening the capacity of social services to support female-headed households with access to and ownership of agricultural assets, and with grants for day-are centers and schools; (4) expanding the agricultural reform program; and increasing staple food crop production; and (5) continued sponsoring of these activities, if they or similar programs modeled after them are successful.  The development of the Social Investment Fund has two sub-components.  In the first, TASIF will be developed by providing equipment, vehicles, salaries, operating costs, training, technical assistance, and financing for monitoring and evaluation.  The second sub-component implements pilot micro-projects in order to train staff and test and modify the targeting, promotion, appraisal, approval, supervision, monitoring and evaluating procedures written in the operational manual."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":31},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":17},"sector5":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Housing construction"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"TJ","sectorcode":"WZ,AZ,JB,FE,YC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"59,78,58,57,54","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,7,7,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":31},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":22},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":17},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":17},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02071204031915","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071204031915","DocDate":"24-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182857","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182857","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031009452780","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031009452780","DocDate":"28-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970716145336","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716145336","DocDate":"10-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052616211782","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052616211782","DocDate":"01-OCT-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052616235181","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052616235181","DocDate":"01-OCT-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tajikistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
