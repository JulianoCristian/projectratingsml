There are three components. The first finances support activities, some of which are ongoing such as initial estimates of entities and systems at risk; an assessment of common approaches, tools, and methodologies to be used; a publicity campaign using various media; acquisition, provision, and training in the use of tools and methodologies; and development of common administrative systems. The second component provides technical assistance to agencies to carry out Y2K diagnostics, technical and impact analysis, preparing implementation plans, preparing terms of reference and supervision of consulting firms, and preparing equipment specifications. The third component funds activities typical of a project's coordination and administration."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Modernizaci\u00f3n estatal</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"30,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48","mjthemecode":"5,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080911012407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080911012407","DocDate":"30-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000012009_20051205103117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051205103117","DocDate":"09-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201421429","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201421429","DocURL":"29-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201421630","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201421630","DocURL":"29-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201421731","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201421731","DocURL":"29-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910530795","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910530795","DocDate":"24-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703525026","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703525026","DocDate":"31-OCT-1998"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic"}},"facets":{}}
