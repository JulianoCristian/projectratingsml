The project would consist of the construction or expansion, and equipment of three primary school teacher training colleges, a secondary school teacher training college, fifteen general secondary schools, four technical schools, and a post-secondary agricultural college. The project would also include technical assistance to provide experts to reinforce the Ministry of Education's planning services and specialist teachers in such subjects as engineering and farm management. The project would be carried out by a Project Unit within the Ministry of Education. The Chief of the Unit and the Project Architect have already been appointed by the Government and are acceptable to the Association. The Government has undertaken to make available promptly all lands required for the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cameroon!$!CM","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CM","sectorcode":"ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da56d9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da56d9_1_0","DocDate":"04-SEP-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de30b1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de30b1_1_0","DocDate":"04-SEP-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b0b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b0b_1_0","DocDate":"04-SEP-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05bb0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05bb0_1_0","DocDate":"04-SEP-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e8c3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e8c3_1_0","DocDate":"04-SEP-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903162144","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903162144","DocDate":"19-AUG-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20111226024718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20111226024718","DocDate":"17-JUL-1969"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cameroon"}},"facets":{}}
