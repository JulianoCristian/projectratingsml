It would also provide treatment facilities for 6.1 cubic m/sec of industrial wastes. It would include: connection of 550,000 households to the sewerage system; construction of 5,500 km of sewage collectors; 60 km of sewage interceptors; 10 sewage pumping stations; and three secondary sewage treatment plants with an aggregate initial capacity of 14.5 cubic m/sec. The project would also include 8,620 man-months of consultancy services for preparation of final engineering and bidding documents; supervision and administration of construction; start up of operations of the treatment plants and pumping stations; monitoring of industrial effluents; and personnel training. About 40% of the beneficiaries would be low-income urban dwellers. The project faces no special risks although delays in the implementation could occur as a result of its magnitude and technical complexity."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"110,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sewerage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"WS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925091426","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925091426","DocDate":"18-NOV-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f69_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f69_1_0","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f68_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f68_1_0","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902294161","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902294161","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912332372","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912332372","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
