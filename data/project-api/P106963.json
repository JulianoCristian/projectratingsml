Its development objectives are to improve the environment for private sector development, and to improve overall functioning of the public sector and the delivery of key public services. The program is divided into two pillars each with several components with pillar one promoting private sector development. First component is to maintain macroeconomic stability; second component is to improve investment climate through reform of licensing and inspections, increasing transparency of the privatization process and promoting market competition; and third component is to reform regulatory frameworks by separating policy making from regulatory functions in key strategic sectors (aviation, cotton, and energy). Pillar two: improve public sector management and public service delivery. First component is public sector management reform through restructuring of core public institutions, reforms of civil service management and wage system, strengthening of the medium-term expenditure framework; and second component is improving social service delivery in health and education."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Aviation","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":43},"theme4":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Aviation"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Other Environmental Study,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"TJ","sectorcode":"JA,TV,YZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"67,40,25,27","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,4,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Aviation","code":"TV"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":43},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":29},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":14},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20100503033256","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100503033256","DocDate":"23-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2009082511581597","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009082511581597","DocDate":"21-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2009082511581597","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009082511581597","DocURL":"21-APR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20090306030047","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090306030047","DocDate":"02-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090605165019","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090605165019","DocDate":"10-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Other Environmental Study (ENS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ENS","EntityID":"000333038_20080617041000","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080617041000","DocDate":"15-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000333038_20081211235017","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081211235017","DocDate":"20-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20080220123025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080220123025","DocDate":"20-FEB-2008"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tajikistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
