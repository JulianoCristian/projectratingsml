The credit will help finance a part of the Government's costs associated with the rapid return of the IDPs, largely ethnic Tamils, to their place of origin, in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka and restore their social and economic life which was destroyed during the internal armed conflict that lasted nearly 30 years'. The Government's plan envisages the return of the IDPs in five phases. Phase one is largely complete and phase two is ongoing and nearing completion. The Government has requested the Bank to finance high priority activities related to phases three and four. The project is expected to reach a total of about 100,000 IDPs."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Other social
