The project is designed to help the Government achieve better outcomes in public resource management by: 1) strengthening program budgets, linking allocations to specific sector objectives, strategies, and action plans; 2) improving service delivery in education, health, and rural development; and, 3) strengthening the fiduciary framework, to promote accountability, and transparency in the use of public funds, including external aid. Nonetheless, the main risks to this operation, and its reform program, come from political instability, vested interests, and fiduciary and institutional issues. However, to minimize those risks, reforms are being implemented in a sensitive context, and in participation with opposition parties in the political dialogue; and, notwithstanding vested interests, and fiduciary risks regarding the use of public funds, such should be mitigated to a substantial extent by the design, and content of the project, given that the supported, main reform measures, will have been taken prior to Board presentation, and, by the fact that substantial technical support will be provided."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BF","sectorcode":"EP,AZ,JA,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"53,78,82,27,40","mjthemecode":"4,2,11,10,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20090428001014","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090428001014","DocDate":"30-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009486_20050127111803","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009486_20050127111803","DocDate":"29-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201320996","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201320996","DocURL":"16-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000094946_0206260400473","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0206260400473","DocDate":"20-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02060504060690","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02060504060690","DocDate":"31-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0203010409597","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0203010409597","DocDate":"25-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01111604032523","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01111604032523","DocDate":"31-OCT-2001"}],"countryname":"Burkina Faso"}},"facets":{}}
