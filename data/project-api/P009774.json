The two weirs are in danger of collapsing and continued supply of irrigation water would avert the danger of a sharp decline in agricultural production in the area. It would safeguard farm incomes and employment for the area's agricultural labor force. The project consists of the construction of two new barrages, which would replace the old weirs across the Mahanadi River and its branch, the Birupa River. The head regulators for the three irrigation canals taking off from the barrages would be replaced by new structures. The project would also include the development of a Drainage Master Plan for the entire Mahanadi delta, including the implementation of selected works identified under the Master Plan, a program of water management pilot operations and the construction of staff accommodation and other buildings required for the supervision and management of the project. The risk associated with the project, apart from those normally inherent in irrigation projects in India, is that one or both of the old weirs might collapse while the new barrages are being constructed."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"83,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e04265_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04265_1_0","DocDate":"02-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04263_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04263_1_0","DocDate":"02-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902362627","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902362627","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912511769","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912511769","DocDate":"31-OCT-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
