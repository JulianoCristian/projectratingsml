PRSC-1 will support the policies and reforms aimed at improving the living conditions of the population by promoting growth, incomes and employment, accelerating human resource development, and strengthening governance and public sector management as spelled out in the country's GPRS. The first PRSC would lay the ground for helping the country to attack poverty in a comprehensive manner. It is envisaged that there will be further single-tranche PRSCs in FY04 and FY05, respectively   PRSC-1 is expected to provide a series of benefits. The main and ultimate benefit is the human progress towards the Millennium Development Goals expected from the growth and service delivery outcomes of the implementation of the program supported by this operation. In addition, there are two intermediate benefits. The first is helping maintain macroeconomic stability by contributing to the closing of the external financing gap. The second is enabling Government to generate the funds required to execute GPRS policies and programs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"125,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"JB,YZ,EZ,JA,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"87,53,65,27,67","mjthemecode":"8,2,8,6,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070531135706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070531135706","DocDate":"17-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20041228140441","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041228140441","DocDate":"14-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20030604172304","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030604172304","DocDate":"29-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000094946_03050904040941","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03050904040941","DocDate":"29-APR-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
