Given the cross-sectoral nature of this project, the strategic framework will be widely supported, namely, through the promotion of labor-intensive macroeconomic growth, and increased private sector investments. The components will: 1) provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG), and the Local Government Finance Commission Secretariat, for capacity building and policy development, as both institutions strive to become operational. Under the decentralization policy, MoLG will mentor local governments, in line with the Constitution, and the Local Governments Act of 1997. Computerized databases will provide the required linkages for adequate information communications; 2) finance basic services delivery investments, and capacity building, through grants from the Central Government to the local governments; 3) support and test, alternative basic services delivery for the Kampala City Council, implemented through reorganization, private financing, and improved management practices; and, 4) support program management, monitoring/evaluation, and, future program formulation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":77},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":16},"sector3":{"Name":"Solid waste management","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"80,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Solid waste management"},{"Name":"Sewerage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"WS,WB,BC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Urban development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,73,25","mjthemecode":"2,9,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Solid waste management","code":"WB"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":77},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":16},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":6},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20041203100801","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041203100801","DocDate":"23-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121325579","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121325579","DocURL":"22-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121325780","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121325780","DocDate":"22-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121325579","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121325579","DocDate":"22-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121325780","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121325780","DocURL":"22-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0002050530266","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0002050530266","DocDate":"31-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99111105303285","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99111105303285","DocDate":"28-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99061607121941","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99061607121941","DocDate":"25-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052610565011","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052610565011","DocDate":"03-DEC-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
