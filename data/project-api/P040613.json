The additional financing will support further investment in the eight initially planned output areas, without any change in the program development objectives or design. Selected priority activities will be expanded to increase the availability of essential health care services, ensuring increased access for the disadvantaged. The additional financing is also an opportunity to accelerate investment in key stewardship functions such as monitoring and evaluation, as well as accountability and transparency in the sector. Progress on these fronts will build confidence across the board and facilitate Nepal in mobilizing stakeholders and ultimately resources in the context of the next phase of the Nepal health sector program due to start in 2010.  The additional financing seeks to achieve: (i) enhanced availability of and access to essential services supported by expanded activities in public private partnerships, human resources management, and logistics; and (ii) rapid progress on key stewardship functions such as monitoring and evaluation, accountability and transparency. The eight output areas will continue to be financed and monitored as originally planned."},"country_namecode":"Nepal!$!NP","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":86},"sector2":{"Name":"Central
