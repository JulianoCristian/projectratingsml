There are three project components. The first component finances as a pilot a number of demand-driven, community or small-producer initiatives, which aim to improve the forms and conditions in which indigenous peoples produce and sell their products and services. This component also includes grant financing of pre-investment studies, technical assistance, small works, goods and operational costs for investments. The second component supports institutional strengthening and training of national level indigenous/campesino organizations and their regional organizations. Activities to be strengthened include operational monitoring, collection of basic information needed for the learning process, participatory evaluation, and feedback into the poverty reduction strategy's social control mechanism. Assistance and training funded by this component covers the hiring of consultants, training and consultation workshops for project evaluation and learning and for PRS adjustment, specialists to coordinate the monitoring and learning process, designing and operating a monitoring and evaluation system, and contracting for an independent impact evaluation study. The third component funds project coordination, financial administration, market and demand studies, and equipment."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":29},"sector2":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade","Percent":22},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"BC,YY,YW,AH,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"53,60,59,57,76","mjthemecode":"10,7,7,7,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Other domestic and international trade","code":"YY"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":29},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":22},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":22},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":22},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060522115838","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060522115838","DocDate":"18-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01030805353961","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01030805353961","DocDate":"25-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00021605302522","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00021605302522","DocDate":"18-DEC-2000"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
