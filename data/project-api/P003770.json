The project will also expand the data collection and planning base for future water resources development. The project consists of two construction components: the Cipamingkis irrigation system (7,600 ha); preliminary works on the Jragung Dam, which will benefit 10,500 ha; and studies and investigations under a Hydrologic Measurement Program and Cimanuk River Water Management Program. The project will ultimately benefit about 36,000 families and will increase rice production by nearly 35,000 tons per year.
