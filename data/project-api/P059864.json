The project contains five components: 1) This component will provide institutional development support to Project Management Unit (PMU) No.18 and Provincial Departments of Transport to implement the project. This includes a training program to Provincial PMUs in project management and monitoring, technical aspects of road rehabilitation and maintenance, contract management, environmental screening of rural roads, and resettlement and land acquisition. 2) This component will strengthen Ministry of Transport's (MOT) capacity to provide strategic leadership in the rural transport sub-sector. It will help MOT to further develop the rural transport strategy, formulate and implement rural transport policy, and provide the strategic direction of the sub-sector. 3) The component will include the rehabilitation of district, commune, and some provincial roads in the project provinces. 4) This component will support the Rural Transport Unit in developing guidelines for maintenance planning and implementation. 5) This component will provide training to the local construction industry."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"103,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Resettlement Plan","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"BH,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rural development","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"26,78,44","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070731101740","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070731101740","DocDate":"27-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201102683","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201102683","DocURL":"24-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99120405314220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99120405314220","DocDate":"24-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703531967","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703531967","DocDate":"19-OCT-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1","DocType":"RPL","EntityID":"000094946_00032106085339","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00032106085339","DocDate":"17-FEB-1999"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
