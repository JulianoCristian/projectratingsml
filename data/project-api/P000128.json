After considering various schemes, the consultants have recommended the proposed project as the least-cost solution to the urgent problem at Lobatse and the longer-term improvement of the water supply system in both towns. A raw water pumping station and treatment plant would be built at Gaborone to serve both Gaborone and Lobatse. A 32-mile pipeline would be built from Gaborone to Nuane, where the water will be pumped into the existing transmission line to the Lobatse distribution system. Main extensions and reservoirs would be constructed in Gaborone and Lobatse. The project would include office and laboratory equipment and equipment for pipe laying, metering and testing, vehicles and laborers' housing. Technical assistance would be provided under the project to establish an appropriate accounting and budgeting system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Botswana!$!BW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"3,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BW","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101911445275","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101911445275","DocDate":"30-DEC-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081da5776_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da5776_1_0","DocDate":"02-FEB-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da5774_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da5774_1_0","DocDate":"02-FEB-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903180316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903180316","DocDate":"31-JAN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903331737","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903331737","DocDate":"31-JAN-1971"}],"countryname":"Republic of Botswana"}},"facets":{}}
