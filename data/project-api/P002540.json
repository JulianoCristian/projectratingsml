It hopes to generate income and employment opportunities for low income, underemployed and unemployed urban and rural households through education. In order to carry out these objectives, a Social and Infrastructure Fund (SIF) will be established. The project will help provide the necessary financing for the SIF, support subprojects in the startup phase and assure funding of subsequent phases. Typical subprojects will be health, education, water supply and markets. SIF will vigorously encourage private initiative by providing investment capital and facilitating entry conditions into profitable private operations. All sponsoring agencies, including individual borrowers in the private sector will receive technical assistance from the SIF. Operations will be monitored through action plans, periodic reports & qualitative surveys in order to ensure that resources are reaching target beneficiaries and achieving desired socio economic goals."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Prin!$!ST","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":20},"sector2":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":23},"theme5":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ST","sectorcode":"FE,EZ,JA,YW,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Human development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,64,51,54,65","mjthemecode":"8,6,6,8,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102525","DocDate":"13-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120492491","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120492491","DocURL":"19-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120492491","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120492491","DocDate":"19-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120492792","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120492792","DocDate":"19-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120492792","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120492792","DocURL":"19-JUL-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08041_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08041_1_0","DocDate":"14-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927221116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927221116","DocDate":"15-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927220947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927220947","DocDate":"15-MAY-1989"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Prin"}},"facets":{}}
