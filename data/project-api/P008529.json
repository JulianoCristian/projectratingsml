These reforms will pave the way for improved intermediation through the banking sector. The credit component of the loan will act as an incentive to the development of intermediation at the medium- and long-term end of the maturity spectrum. The project will have three components: 1) a credit line component that will provide resources for commercial banks to make medium- and long-term loans to recently privatized and other private sector Latvian enterprises for investment and related permanent working needs; 2) an institutional development component that will support the Latvian Privatization Agency by financing an accelerated privatization track through open auctions, and to also support the development of a Project Management Unit and a Technical Unit; and 3) a financial infrastructure investment component for computer hardware and software for payments system development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Latvia!$!LV","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":85},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LV","sectorcode":"FG,BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,44,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","code":"FG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":85},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0006130535021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0006130535021","DocDate":"14-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200153346","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200153346","DocURL":"09-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200153447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200153447","DocDate":"09-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200153044","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200153044","DocDate":"09-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200153145","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200153145","DocURL":"09-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200153346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200153346","DocDate":"09-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3d0c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3d0c_1_0","DocDate":"20-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006082212","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006082212","DocDate":"16-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006081952","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006081952","DocDate":"16-AUG-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Latvia"}},"facets":{}}
