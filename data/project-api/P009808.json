The project will build significant institutional, financial and legislative reforms already underway to strengthen metropolitan agencies and municipal governments and other institutions responsible for urban planning, management and operation. At the same time, the project will substantially increase the availability of urban services, focusing on investments to provide minimum basic needs at affordable prices. Emphasis will be given to alleviate sectoral and spatial investment imbalances between the \"metrocore\" (Calcutta and Howrah) and the remainder of the CMA, to complete and complement earlier investments so that maximum benefits can be derived, and to improve cost recovery and financial management policies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"147,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban management"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"UM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban management","code":"UM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901014680","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901014680","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228cdf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228cdf_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e05d37_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05d37_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05d31_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05d31_1_0","DocDate":"19-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902420533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902420533","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
