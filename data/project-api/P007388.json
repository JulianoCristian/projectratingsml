Achievement of these objectives will remove bottlenecks to trade, reduce transportation costs, attract private investment to the transport sector (reducing the need for public funding) and help redirect the focus of the state away from the provision of services. The project has three main components: (1) the policy component is reflected in the Government's transport sector policy declaration, which spells out a medium-term strategy for the sector, and in the related action plans specifying the measures to be taken to address the most important sector issues; (2) the investment component will finance a time slice of the Government's 1993-1996 Transport Sector Investment Program; and (3) a institutional development technical assistance component."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and
