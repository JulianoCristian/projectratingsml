The purpose of this restructuring is to further clarify the definition of incremental operating costs in the project\u0092s legal agreements, at the request of the project implementing Entity. Achievement of development objectives and implementation progress are rated satisfactory. Access to telecommunications services, particularly mobile telephony and internet, continues to improve in Solomon Islands (the \u0091recipient\u0092), with mobile penetration approaching 60 percent as of October 2013. Following a successful transition from a monopolistic to a competitive market there are now five active service providers, including Solomon Telekom Ltd (STL, the incumbent), Bemobile, the second mobile service provider which became active in August 2010, as well as three new entrants in 2012. An independent regulator, the Telecommunications Commission of the Solomon Islands (TCSI, also referred to as the project implementing entity), has been established and is
