The project comprises the first stage (1981-85) of Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica's (CORELCA) 15-year Rural Electrification Program to expand and improve electricity supply in the main villages throughout the Region. The project consists of: (a) provision of electricity supply to about 120 rural villages; (b) rehabilitation of old, deteriorated distribution networks in six villages; (c) interconnection with the CORELCA system of twenty-five villages now dependent upon unreliable and costly local diesel generation; (d) a training program to strengthen the technical skills of CORELCA and the Electrificadoras' staff; and (e) a study to help minimize heavy power losses in the Electrificadoras' distribution systems."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"36,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925075558","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925075558","DocDate":"18-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902374299","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902374299","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912535629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912535629","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e972eb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e972eb_1_0","DocDate":"21-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e972ea_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e972ea_1_0","DocDate":"21-MAY-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
