It will provide for the procurement of construction equipment, construction of civil works by contractors, and supervision of construction by consultants. The project's principal beneficiaries will include producers and consumers as well as users of bus transport in the project area who will benefit from more efficient road services resulting from lower vehicle operating costs. The formulation of the project reflects lessons learned from the First Highway Project (Credit 408-BD) and the risks are accordingly small."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924165957","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924165957","DocDate":"30-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912464793","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912464793","DocDate":"31-DEC-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd1b9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd1b9_1_0","DocDate":"13-DEC-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902335957","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902335957","DocDate":"30-NOV-1979"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
