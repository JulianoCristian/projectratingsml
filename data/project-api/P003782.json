The proposed project would: (a) upgrade 12 existing agricultural development schools and three existing in-service training centers; and (b) establish five new agricultural development schools and 7 new in-service training centers. The majority of these centers and schools would be located in provinces outside Java. In addition, the project would introduce courses in animal health and rural home improvement in all agricultural development schools and training centers. The project would develop and introduce an agricultural management training program and includes fellowships and technical assistance for management, training, procurement, preparation of future education projects, middle-level agricultural manpower surveys, and tracer studies. The main benefit of the project would be to help ease the shortage of qualified middle-level agricultural manpower."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"42,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924213039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924213039","DocDate":"19-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902324389","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902324389","DocDate":"30-APR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912423363","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912423363","DocDate":"30-APR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e491_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e491_1_0","DocDate":"24-APR-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
