The project will strengthen mining sector institutions through: 1) support to the Minerals Commission to improve its organizational structure; expand its promotional activities; formulate regulations and amend existing legislation; develop guidelines and standards for environmental monitoring and control; 2) support the Mines Department to carry out its inspection, monitoring and enforcement responsibilities; 3) support the Geological Survey to improve its geological information base; 4) support to the Ministry of Energy and Mines to carry out its policy planning and coordination role. The project will also provide assistance to small-scale mining enterprises through: 1) pilot testing of identified modules of small-scale mining equipment for improving both productivity and yields; 2) a program to make better geological information available to small-scale miners through the assistance of geologists to delineate recoverable ore bodies; 3) improvements in the sector framework for small scale mining operations (SSM); and 4) reclamation and rehabilitation of priority areas degraded through past SSM activities as a pilot exercise."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Mining and other extractive","Percent":37},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":23},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"12,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Mining and other extractive"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"JB,LB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"41,33,83,48,40","mjthemecode":"4,5,11,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Mining and other extractive","code":"LB"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":37},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":23}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000094946_03081404004344","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03081404004344","DocDate":"01-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02070304084467","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02070304084467","DocDate":"12-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121264474","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121264474","DocURL":"25-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121264474","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121264474","DocDate":"25-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23ec0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23ec0_1_0","DocDate":"13-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019101227","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019101227","DocDate":"19-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135502","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135502","DocDate":"31-JAN-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
