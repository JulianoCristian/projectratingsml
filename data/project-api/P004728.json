The type of activities eligible for financing would be broadly based and include medium- and long-term agricultural lending countrywide and short-term lending for a pilot scheme in the North and Northeast, which intends to provide credit/extension packages to small farmers. Jointly financed with IFAD, the Bank loan aims to finance term lending countrywide, while IFAD funds would be restricted to financing term lending in the North and Northeast to small farmers engaged in food production and short-term lending under the pilot scheme. Providing additional resources to BAAC through this project, would boost the level of economic activity in rural areas and thereby contribute towards employment generation, poverty alleviation and increased rural production."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"70,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925171454","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925171454","DocDate":"30-DEC-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902413370","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902413370","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901013147","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901013147","DocDate":"31-MAY-1983"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
