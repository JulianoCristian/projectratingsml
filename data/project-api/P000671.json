Other needed improvements such as extension and marketing service, credit, land registration and further infrastructural improvements to assist the development of about 320,000 ha of additional cultivable land, would have to wait until further studies are completed. The proposed project includes financing for these studies which are expected to provide the basis for a second phase agricultural project."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"3,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190316579","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190316579","DocDate":"30-APR-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810190320006","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190320006","DocDate":"30-APR-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da5ab9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da5ab9_1_0","DocDate":"28-APR-1970"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
