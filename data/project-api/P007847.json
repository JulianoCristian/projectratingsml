Special emphasis will be placed on gender and indigenous aspects. Specific operational goals include: creating capacity at the local level to organize, self-diagnose problems, plan activities, seek out and negotiate assistance, and act to resolve priority quality of life issues; (2) establishing a demand-driven financing mechanism operating in high poverty areas and providing matching grants to communities; and (3) promoting long-term conservation and sustainable use of Panama's biodiversity resources. To meet these objectives, the project will finance three components: (a) sustainable rural development, promoting community training, organization, planning, and investment; (b) biodiversity conservation, financing research and planning and environmental impact assessment and monitoring, capacity building for participants and institutional strengthening in environmental impact assessment processes; and (c) activities contributing to biodiversity conservation and sustainable use; and (c) coordination of the two components by a unit also financed to provide technical assistance and studies related to rural development and natural resources management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Panama!$!PA","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":46},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":26},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"22,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"PA","sectorcode":"AZ,BC,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,79,80,77","mjthemecode":"10,11,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":46},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":26}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050103110851","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050103110851","DocDate":"26-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200303456","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200303456","DocURL":"08-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200303456","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200303456","DocDate":"08-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200303557","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200303557","DocDate":"08-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200303557","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200303557","DocURL":"08-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182258","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102903","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102903","DocDate":"14-APR-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061614200105","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061614200105","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Panama"}},"facets":{}}
