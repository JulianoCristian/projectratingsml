The main objectives of the project are to : a) provide road links necessary for the development and integration of the Selebi-Phikwe area and its hinterland; b) strengthen the capacity of the RD to organize and carry out effective road maintenance at the increased level mandated by the expansion of the road network; and c) improve road planning and programming capability in anticipation of the seventh National Development Plan in 1991. Project components comprise the following : 1) construction of the Sefophe-Martin's Drift road, 134 km, to bitumen standard, and village access roads; 2) construction of the Bobonong-Lekkerpoet road, 66 km, including two short access roads to the villages of Molalatau and Mathathane; and 3) consulting services for construction supervision and for preparation of a study for a new maintenance management / organization system for roads, combined with a network planning study."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Botswana!$!BW","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"14,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"BW","sectorcode":"TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development"],"themecode":"78","mjthemecode":"10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625093615","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625093615","DocDate":"31-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929035617","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929035617","DocDate":"07-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929035424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929035424","DocDate":"07-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_99040705592964","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99040705592964","DocDate":"31-MAY-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Botswana"}},"facets":{}}
