The programmatic DPO continue to address governance issues in the forestry and mining sectors and improve environmental management. Currently forestry, wildlife, and mining are a key to Ghana's economy and share common challenges, including revenues that are not well captured and large numbers of people dependent on the sector for their livelihood. In addition, environmental policy needs to be strengthened to effectively control pollution, and to reduce long-term negative health and economic impacts due to environmental degradation and climate change. Ghana has recognized the need to address these important issues. The 2006-2009 Second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) has the overarching goals of sustaining economic growth of at least six percent per year to attain middle-income country status and surpass the 2015 millennium development goal of halving poverty levels to 26 percent of the population and reducing inequalities. The expected outcomes at the end of the DPO series include: (i) improved management of government revenues and finances in the forestry and mining sectors; (ii) reduced illegal logging; (iii) reduced social conflict in forestry and mining communities; and (iv) integration of environmental considerations into policy formulation and implementation across government, including risks associated with climate change."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","Percent":33},"sector2":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":18},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":10},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":18},"theme4":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":18},"theme5":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":36},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"AZ,YW,AT,LS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,80,81,79,77","mjthemecode":"10,10,11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","code":"LS"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":33},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":33},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":17},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000442464_20140718092837","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20140718092837","DocDate":"30-JUN-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20120112013538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120112013538","DocDate":"28-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010050714273874","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010050714273874","DocDate":"14-AUG-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333038_20090703001422","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090703001422","DocDate":"04-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000013944_20090528193434","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000013944_20090528193434","DocDate":"04-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090107151004","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090107151004","DocDate":"07-JAN-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
