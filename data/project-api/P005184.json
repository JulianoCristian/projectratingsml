The project also includes the establishment of about 1,900 small sheep and poultry farms and the improvement of 5,500 hectares of range land for livestock production. Project works are expected to be completed by March 21, 1972, which is the end of Iranian calendar year 1350. Work on a limited part of the project has been proceeding since 1964 but in view of the complexity of the problems involved a detailed program for the whole project was not completed until the end of 1966. Full development of the newly irrigated land is expected to be achieved within about ten years and to result in an increase in net farm output of about $16 million a year."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Iran!$!IR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"22,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IR","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912375580","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912375580","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903021551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903021551","DocDate":"31-AUG-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903491687","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903491687","DocDate":"31-AUG-1967"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Iran"}},"facets":{}}
