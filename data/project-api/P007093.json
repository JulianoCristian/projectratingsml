The project, to be carried out over seven years, will: (a) establish a program for medium- and long-term loans through the Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF) and private banks to finance on-farm investments for crop and livestock production, and marketing infrastructure at the farm level; and (b) provide institutional strengthening to BNF.  This latter component is aimed at strengthening the capability of the Departments of Credit and Finance.  It will also train BNF staff, both locally and abroad, in the areas of:  savings mobilization, credit promotion, programming and planning, accounting, auditing, reporting, project formulation and subloan appraisal, approval and supervision."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"48,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961219133143","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219133143","DocDate":"28-JUN-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
