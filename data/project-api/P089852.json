(See report no. 27627 (PGD)) The overall program of World Bank support includes three sector adjustment and development policy loans and a US$7.7 million Housing and Urban Technical Assistance Loan. The program supports the Government's efforts to improve national policies and institutions for housing and urban development; make the federal housing system more efficient by designing and implementing a unified system of subsidies to facilitate access to housing by low- and moderate-income families; bolster systems for housing loans and savings and move them down-market; strengthen urban real property registries and rights; coordinate and support physical and social investments in poor neighborhoods; increase the supply of and access to urban land for poor people and improve this market's functioning; and increase capacity to prevent and manage the damage caused by natural disasters. This second loan in the series provides continued support for the Government's program, which has made strong progress towards its outlined goals. In particular, HUDPL-II will support five main areas: 1) Reforming the operation and structure of federal housing subsidies. 2) Developing new financing mechanisms for home purchases, improvements, and additions for low- and moderate-income populations. 3) Expanding the program for modernizing property registries. 4) Strengthening the slum upgrading program. 5) Expanding low- and moderate-income land development."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Housing finance","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Central
