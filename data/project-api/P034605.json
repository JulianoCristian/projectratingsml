The project will achieve these objectives through the following components. The first component will seek to strengthen financial sector operation and regulation through: a) support to the Central Bank in banking supervision through regulatory advice, training and equipment; b) support the Central Bank in improving monetary management through assistance in developing procedures and related staff training; and c) support in restructuring of state-owned financial institutions. The second component seeks, through privatization, to transfer public ownership of a majority of public enterprises to private hands and in this manner, to also stimulate investment. The third component aims to strengthen the business environment through support to the Office of GO-INVEST (the Guyana Office Investment) with training of staff to help simplify procedures for foreign investors, and b) consultant support in the development of regulations under the Companies Act and training of staff of the Registry of Companies to strengthen its capacity to implement this Act."},"country_namecode":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana!$!GY","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":45},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"3,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"GY","sectorcode":"FA,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Economic management","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,43,23,44","mjthemecode":"4,1,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":55},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":45}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20040721113550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040721113550","DocDate":"15-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00012505382050","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00012505382050","DocDate":"25-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123344614","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123344614","DocURL":"11-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123344614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123344614","DocDate":"11-JAN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b452_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b452_1_0","DocDate":"15-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961007145652","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007145652","DocDate":"22-NOV-1994"}],"countryname":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana"}},"facets":{}}
