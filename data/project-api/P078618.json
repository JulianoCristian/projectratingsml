The overall objective of  this operation is to deepen, broaden, and sustain the reforms underway in the areas of public administration and fiscal management. The operation builds on the reforms initiated under the Emergency Public Administration Projects (EPAP) of the International Development Association to improve the GOA'S own fiduciary standards. Deepening and broadening these reforms is critical for poverty reduction assistance to be effective. The operation supports on-going reforms to strengthen the budget process, increase the administrative capacity of  line ministries and sub-national governments, develop revenue policy and administration, and improve civil service effectiveness. The operation also supports the implementation of  reforms that lead to a more efficient allocation of  fiscal resources in the areas of  human development (health, basic education and social protection) and private sector development (investment climate, financial sector, and state-owned enterprises). More comprehensive, thematic reforms in human and private sector development will require support through other instruments, including sectoral operations and technical assistance. The first Credit would be released in one tranche upon Credit effectiveness."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government
