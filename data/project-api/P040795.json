These measures are made up of general social benefits from existing general income support programs, and special severance packages anticipated for PKP layoffs. The second component will support the Labor Redeployment Programs, which are made up of re-qualification training as well as professional and social advice and other forms of professional guidance. These include general labor redeployment programs, and special labor redeployment programs anticipated for PKP layoffs.
