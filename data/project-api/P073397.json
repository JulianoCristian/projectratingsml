The project will, at the national level, support the development of a coordinated and consistent legal and institutional framework for environmental and water resources management. The project comprises of four components, namely: habitat and species conservation and management; establishment of final water rights; implementation of an updated environmental management plan; and institutional strengthening. While the project will improve the Government's capacity to manage a threatened ecosystem, major risks are associated with increased power demands in Tanzania, which may limit the Tanzania Electric Supply Company's ability to provide sufficient bypass water flows necessary to conserve the Gorge ecosystem, as well as long-term risks associated with drought management."},"country_namecode":"United
