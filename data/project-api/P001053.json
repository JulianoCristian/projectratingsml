First, work plans will be prepared for forestry protection and management with a view to a) reducing deterioration and regenerating the humid and dry forests, b) increasing wood product self-sufficiency, c) creating employment in forest industries, and d) increasing government revenues from commercial use of forests. To protect the humid forests from encroachment, an inventory of land rights will be undertaken, as a pilot operation. Second, an integrated fisheries management system will be introduced, aimed at a) protecting fisheries resources, b) strengthening and implementing transparent licensing procedures for industrial fisheries, c) maintaining a sustainable yield, and d) increasing government revenues. The project will comprise three major components : the protection and management of the natural forests (humid and dry), a pilot operation aimed at registering land rights in the humid forest, and the management of offshore fisheries."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"sector2":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":53},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":30},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"8,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"BG,AZ,AT,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"86,25","mjthemecode":"2,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":53},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970909142433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970909142433","DocDate":"18-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120511641","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120511641","DocURL":"09-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120511641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120511641","DocDate":"09-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120511942","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120511942","DocDate":"09-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120511942","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120511942","DocURL":"09-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0847f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0847f_1_0","DocDate":"24-OCT-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928001727","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928001727","DocDate":"08-SEP-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928001502","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928001502","DocDate":"08-SEP-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
