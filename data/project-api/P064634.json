Achievement of these objectives will remove bottlenecks to trade, reduce transportation costs, attract private investment to the transport sector (reducing the need for public funding) and help redirect the focus of the state away from the provision of services. The project has three main components: (1) the policy component is reflected in the Government's transport sector policy declaration, which spells out a medium-term strategy for the sector, and in the related action plans specifying the measures to be taken to address the most important sector issues; (2) the investment component will finance a time slice of the Government's 1993-1996 Transport Sector Investment Program; and (3) a institutional development technical assistance component."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Aviation","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Aviation"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"TV,BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"45,39,52","mjthemecode":"6,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Aviation","code":"TV"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":67},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20040614181654","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040614181654","DocDate":"27-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02062904010140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02062904010140","DocDate":"31-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911065471","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911065471","DocDate":"16-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003132241","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003132241","DocDate":"31-JAN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003132410","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003132410","DocDate":"11-JAN-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras"}},"facets":{}}
