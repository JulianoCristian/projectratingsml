There are four main project components. The first improves a road section connecting the Northern Highway to the Western Highway. The second component implements road maintenance by contract as part of a pilot project at one or more of seven districts and strengthens the maintenance department of the ministry of works and transport. It also finances technical assistance, vehicles and computer equipment, physical works, and supervision for a pilot project. The third component supports the improvement of the drainage system for selected municipalities. The fourth component finances technical assistance comprising studies, engineering services, and training staff at the Ministry of works and Transport."},"country_namecode":"Belize!$!BZ","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"13,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Flood protection"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BZ","sectorcode":"BC,WD,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,85,39","mjthemecode":"4,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":50},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20080721025859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080721025859","DocDate":"23-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060403090030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060403090030","DocDate":"27-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000012009_20040916154053","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040916154053","DocDate":"06-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200433000","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200433000","DocURL":"08-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052009513695","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052009513695","DocDate":"08-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200433000","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200433000","DocDate":"08-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00081705302260","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081705302260","DocDate":"16-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00031705301880","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00031705301880","DocDate":"30-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00031705301881","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00031705301881","DocDate":"30-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703531968","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703531968","DocDate":"25-SEP-1998"}],"countryname":"Belize"}},"facets":{}}
