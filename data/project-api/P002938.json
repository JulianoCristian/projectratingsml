It will provide financial assistance to support four broad sets of activities.  First, the project will support the institutional development of the National Agricultural Research System.  It will finance the activities of the National Agricultural Research Organization Board and Secretariat, develop and implement improved administrative, evaluative and priority-setting systems for research programs, and upgrade the capacity of researchers to implement the priority research programs.  Second, the project will support the rehabilitation of research institutes at Serere, Tororo, Jinja and Kifu, and provide the requisite vehicles and research equipment.  Third, it will support the implementation of the high-priority research programs by providing payments for incremental recurrent operating costs, including salaries and allowances under the newly introduced Terms and Conditions of Service for research.  Fourth, the project will support strengthening agricultural education and training capabilities at Makerere University.  Especially, it will support the domestic and foreign based education of degree candidates and staff, the upgrade of facilities and equipment at three faculties and improved curricula for the programs at the Colleges of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":62},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":38},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"25,040,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,77,25","mjthemecode":"2,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":62},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":38}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20050628111902","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050628111902","DocDate":"14-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01042508503043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01042508503043","DocDate":"30-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121143194","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121143194","DocURL":"26-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121143395","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121143395","DocDate":"26-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121143194","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121143194","DocDate":"26-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121143395","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121143395","DocURL":"26-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1222f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1222f_1_0","DocDate":"15-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1222d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1222d_1_0","DocDate":"15-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003085728","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003085728","DocDate":"23-NOV-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003085404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003085404","DocDate":"23-NOV-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
