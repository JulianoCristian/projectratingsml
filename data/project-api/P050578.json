There are four project components. The first enhances educational access and quality by 1) financing research and evaluation of innovative educational models, strategies, and curriculum for grades K-12; and disseminates the results of this work; 2) pilot testing and evaluation of the programs of \"Telesecundaria' and \"Aceleracion del Aprendizaje\"; and 3) designing reforms of pre-service teacher training programs and providing equipment and training materials. At the local level, this component funds sub-projects which may support reforming in-service teacher education programs, creating/strengthening education demand through targeted information campaigns, creating incentive schemes to increase school coverage, and implementing projects linking school learning with productivity. The second component provides technical assistance to strengthen the education ministry's capacity for project implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and knowledge management; supports the formation of strategic partnerships; and builds the capacity of municipalities to create education plans and improve school governance. The third component supports the ministry's role in reinforcing participatory and democratic forms of school governance and developing social capital and civic values. The fourth component strengthens information systems and designs, implements, and evaluates pilot projects."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"JB,EV,BZ,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Urban development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,65,73,25,78","mjthemecode":"10,2,9,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":42},{"Name":"Education","Percent":21},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17},{"Name":"Education","Percent":11},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070820093159","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070820093159","DocDate":"15-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20060508124241","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060508124241","DocDate":"01-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201531903","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201531903","DocURL":"20-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00032505302190","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00032505302190","DocDate":"10-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703532069","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703532069","DocDate":"08-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060311283530","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060311283530","DocDate":"20-JUL-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
