The project now proposed for Bank financing would include civil works to extend the powerhouse to ten units, and the installation of unit 4 complete and of embedded parts for units 5 to 10. It would also provide for consulting services for engineering and supervision during procurement and construction. The basic powerhouse construction would be completed during 1969-72. Unit 4, the first in the expansion program, would come into service in 1973; the remaining six units would be erected one each year commencing in 1975. The resulting power capacity would meet the market forcast for Guri through 1980."},"country_namecode":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela!$!VE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"31,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"VE","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903154727","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903154727","DocDate":"30-JUN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67e1f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67e1f_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67e1e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67e1e_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1969"}],"countryname":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela"}},"facets":{}}
