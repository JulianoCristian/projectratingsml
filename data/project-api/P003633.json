The project will include priority tasks that are part of an agreed Medium Term Policy Action Program of sector reform for 1994-97, thus helping develop conditions for increasing competition and private participation.  The government expects the reforms will enable sustained rapid sector development as needed to overcome widespread telecommunications shortages which result in high costs throughout the economy and impede effective implementation of development programs in other productive and social sectors.  In the course of helping the government achieve these objectives, the project will finance investments in modern technology for fiber optic long distance links connecting eleven provinces and local digital switching in three provinces."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u7535\u4fe1\u53d1\u5c55\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5e2e\u52a9\u53d1\u5c55\u73b0\u4ee3\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\u7535\u4fe1\u884c\u4e1a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9010\u6b65\u6839\u636e\u5e02\u573a\u529b\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\u30021994-1997\u5e74\u7535\u4fe1\u884c\u4e1a\u6539\u9769\u4e2d\u671f\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u5df2\u7ecf\u4e16\u884c\u548c\u6574\u4e2a\u653f\u5e9c\u8ba4\u53ef\uff0c\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u5de5\u4f5c\u5373\u662f\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5c06\u5e2e\u52a9\u8425\u9020\u589e\u5f3a\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u79c1\u8425\u90e8\u95e8\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5e0c\u671b\u6539\u9769\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u4e1a\u8fc5\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u7535\u4fe1\u670d\u52a1\u666e\u904d\u77ed\u7f3a\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u56e0\u670d\u52a1\u77ed\u7f3a\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u6574\u4e2a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9886\u57df\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5176\u5b83\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u8ff0\u76ee\u6807\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u8d44\u52a9\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6280\u672f\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u9014\u5149\u7ea4\u7535\u7f06\u5c0611\u7701\u53ca3\u7701\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u6570\u5b57\u4ea4\u6362\u7cfb\u7edf\u8054\u901a\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"BG,CT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,34,40","mjthemecode":"4,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01033105303021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01033105303021","DocDate":"13-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007072339","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007072339","DocDate":"30-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123015063","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123015063","DocURL":"25-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123015063","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123015063","DocDate":"25-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99d82_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99d82_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1993"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
