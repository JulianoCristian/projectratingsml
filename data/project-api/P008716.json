It would include construction of three ports on the canal (at Cernavoda, Medgidea, and Basarabi), two locks and their operating equipment (at Cernavoda and Agigea), related ancillary works and equipment (such as service roads, rail connections, utilities, buildings, signalling and control systems), and replacement, reconstruction or relocation of existing transport, irrigation and other facilities affected by the construction of the canal. The benefits for the Romanian economy of using its low cost energy saving inland waterway system more fully for large volumes of bulk cargo movement would be considerable as would the benefits generated from savings in ocean freight costs as a result of using large bulk carriers. The project would also benefit other Danubian countries, and would become an integral part of the European waterway system when the Rhine-Main-Danube canal is completed in 1984. It would also help accelerate economic development in the relatively poor Dobrogea region through which the canal runs, and provide local irrigation and power benefits."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924224052","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924224052","DocDate":"23-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e958f1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958f1_1_0","DocDate":"22-JAN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e958f0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e958f0_1_0","DocDate":"22-JAN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902341584","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902341584","DocDate":"31-DEC-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912473159","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912473159","DocDate":"31-DEC-1979"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
