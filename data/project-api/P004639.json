The project includes about 95 percent of the capital investment program for sewerage in Singapore during the period 1968 through June 1972. Parts of the sewerage program still under construction in 1968 but nearing completion under contracts awarded in the past few years are not included in the project. The project does include some contracts already awarded and the proposed loan would finance about US$250,000 for payments to be made after the date of the proposed loan on contracts awarded in 1968, provided they conform to the Bank's requirements for procurement."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Singapore!$!SG","sector1":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sewerage"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"SG","sectorcode":"WS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67b1d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67b1d_1_0","DocDate":"01-JUL-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190306352","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190306352","DocDate":"30-JUN-1968"}],"countryname":"Republic of Singapore"}},"facets":{}}
