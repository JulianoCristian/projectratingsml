In particular, HEDPP aims to strengthen governance, rationalize financing, improve the quality of teaching and research, improve accountability for performance, and enhance transparency in financial management within the higher education sector. The Higher Education Development Policy - First Operation (HEDPO1) will be the first in a programmatic series of three single-tranche Development Policy Credits (DPCs) to support the sustained implementation of selected elements of the Government's reform agenda. The policy matrix (annex two) and monitoring framework (annex three) describe the main areas of the program along with the expected outcomes. In particular, it indicates the relevant prior actions and benchmarks for HEDPO1, as well as policy triggers and benchmarks for the following two operations (HEDP02 and HEDP03)."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":30},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":70},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"66,27","mjthemecode":"2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000477144_20141231105847","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000477144_20141231105847","DocDate":"24-DEC-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010041915001199","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010041915001199","DocDate":"21-AUG-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000350881_20090626113049","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20090626113049","DocDate":"23-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090309100532","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090309100532","DocDate":"03-MAR-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000160016_20080514112806","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20080514112806","DocDate":"28-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20071023114143","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20071023114143","DocDate":"19-APR-2007"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}},"facets":{}}
