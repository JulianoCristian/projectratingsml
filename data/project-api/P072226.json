The additional financing will extend the new integrated and decentralized approach to HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health services in ten health districts in five regions, in addition to the capital city, Ndjamena. This approach decentralizes oversight to local governments, involves community-based organization in service delivery, and expands the use of mobile teams to reach isolated villages. It will also introduce a results-based financing (RBF) approach to improve maternal and child health outcomes that will be piloted in two additional regions. Lastly, the additional financing will strengthen monitoring and evaluation, including data collection, analysis, and the use of national household based surveys, and medical waste management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":18},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government
