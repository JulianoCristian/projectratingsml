The Program objectives and its subsequent phases will contribute to the reduction of HIV infections, and mitigate the socio-economic impact of the epidemic in the Great Lakes Region, by developing regional collaboration, and implementing interventions that can add value to the efforts of each individual country. This project will thus establish HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and mitigation programs for mobile, and vulnerable groups such as refugees, transport sector workers, and highly affected/infected populations within the region states, and, enhance prospects for coordinated approaches addressing HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment and mitigation among the States. Project components are as follows. The first component, support to refugees, and displaced persons will provide services to a limited number of such populations, and could include the full range of prevention, care, treatment and mitigation, namely through provision of services and goods (very little civil works, primarily rehabilitation is envisioned). Component 2 - Support to HIV/AIDS related networks concerns transport networking, and will focus on a) long-haul workers and those communities and groups associated with them, and, b) on two principal transmission corridors, namely Mombasa-Nairobi-Kampala-Kigali-Bujumbura-Bukavu-Goma, and, Dar es Salaam-Dodoma-Kigali-Bujumbura-Bukavu-Goma. This component will provide important reinforcement of national, and under-funded regional advocacy efforts to reduce the stigma of those infected and affected; and, engage in the sharing and testing
