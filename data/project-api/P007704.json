Specific objectives are to : a) upgrade the quality of high level skills training and middle level technician training; b) selectively expand the range of CONALEP's training activities in key sectors; and c) strengthen the administration of CONALEP.  The project would achieve these objectives through the implementation of three components.  The first includes quality improvements in the area of teacher training, advance technology pre-service training, and high level in-service training in eight selected centers.  The second component encompasses expansion of training activities, including the initiation of a modular program in the evening.  The third component involves increasing efficiency and includes measures such as strengthening CONALEP's cost accounting/recovery systems; improving the efficiency of student flows and graduate placement; and development of a communications network."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":82},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":18},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"152,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BC,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Human development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"65,66,51","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":82},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":18}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00030905341065","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00030905341065","DocDate":"30-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122453402","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122453402","DocURL":"14-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122453402","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122453402","DocDate":"14-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122452598","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122452598","DocURL":"14-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122452799","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122452799","DocURL":"14-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122453000","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122453000","DocURL":"14-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122453201","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122453201","DocURL":"14-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122453000","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122453000","DocDate":"14-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122453201","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122453201","DocDate":"14-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122452598","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122452598","DocDate":"14-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122452799","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122452799","DocDate":"14-OCT-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001055149","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001055149","DocDate":"31-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001054949","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001054949","DocDate":"31-MAY-1991"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
