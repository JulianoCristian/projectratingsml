While the PRSC-4 support will translate primarily into funding for the implementation of the GPRS II, particular attention is given leveraging the poverty emphasis of several sector focused operations by ensuring appropriate expenditure allocation (level and structure) and by addressing some of the financing implications of proposed policy actions. The PRSC-4 also focuses on cross-cutting issues related to private sector development and the strengthening of institutions, ranging from issues related to governance, public sector reform, decentralization and public financial management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Quatri\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-4)</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le quatri\u00e8me Cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSC-4) au Ghana s\u2019articulera autour de trois composantes principales du nouvel agenda de r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 : (i) croissance acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e men\u00e9e par le secteur priv\u00e9, (ii) vigoureux d\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines et (iii) bonne gouvernance et responsabilit\u00e9 civique.
