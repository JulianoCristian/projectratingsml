Secondary objectives include improving the quality and efficiency of secondary and higher education and strengthening education sector planning and management.  To achieve these objectives, the project supports policy measures:  (a) in primary education to contain costs, diversify sources of financing, and reduce inequities between urban and rural areas, and between boys and girls; (b) in secondary education to improve internal efficiency; and (c) in sector planning and management, to decentralize education planning, administration and supervision to the regional and departmental levels.  In addition, the project will finance investments designed to:  (a) expand access to primary education and improve its quality and efficiency; (b) improve the quality and efficiency of secondary and higher education; and (c) strengthen sector planning and management capacities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":83},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"sector3":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"ET,ES,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,59,65,78","mjthemecode":"10,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":83},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01032805411660","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032805411660","DocDate":"05-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121153422","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121153422","DocDate":"30-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121153422","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121153422","DocURL":"30-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1229b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1229b_1_0","DocDate":"18-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003090446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003090446","DocDate":"11-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003090121","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003090121","DocDate":"11-FEB-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
