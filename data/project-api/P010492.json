High fertility is part of a web of poor social indicators in Pakistan, tied to slow progress in the social sectors as well as poverty. The best way to slow population growth will be to build demand for smaller families through improvements in education and economic opportunity, especially for women, and in children's survival prospects, while supplying better family planning information and services so that couples can more easily limit fertility. Family planning will then become a more appealing option. Pakistan's Social Action Program, which covers primary education, primary health care, population, and rural water supply, will address both \"demand\" and \"supply\" aspects of family planning. The Population Welfare Program Project will contribute mainly by strengthening supply of family planning information and services, to meet the demand that already exists. It will thus complement other Social Action (SAP) programs and projects in education and health as well as broader efforts to promote economic opportunity that will generate further demand."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":73},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":16},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"65,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"JB,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"69,65,59,78,63","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,10,7,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":73},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00082605462750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082605462750","DocDate":"28-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123351132","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123351132","DocURL":"07-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123351233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123351233","DocDate":"07-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123351132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123351132","DocDate":"07-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123351233","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123351233","DocURL":"07-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b496_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b496_1_0","DocDate":"14-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b494_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b494_1_0","DocDate":"14-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007101246","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007101246","DocDate":"10-FEB-1995"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
