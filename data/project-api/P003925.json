The credit aspect of the project provides for general purpose financing in all sectors while the technical assistance element seeks to enable BRI to (i) develop its capacity to design, implement and analyze studies for monitoring and evaluation and (ii) improve the capability of BRI's field auditors and supervisory staff.
