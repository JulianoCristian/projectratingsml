This project is in its seventh year of implementation and has had many difficulties.  It was restructured in May 2007.  Nevertheless its performance declined in 2008 and 2009, the main reason being deficiencies in project management and coordination during the period when the implementing agency the Tianjin Municipal Construction and Administration Commission (TCAC) was restructured and replaced with a new agency, the Tianjin Municipal Urban Rural Construction and Transport Commission (TURCTC). The Ministry of Finance, by letter dated February 18, 2011, has requested the following changes to the project:  (i) changes to the scope, description and location for some components; (ii) extending the closing date of the project by 12 months to June 30, 2012; (iii) reallocating loan proceeds among various categories; (iv) increasing the disbursement percentage for the works categories to 100 percent  retroactive to June 1, 2010; and, (v) updating the name of the project implementing agency to reflect organizational changes within the Tianjin Municipal government.  The changes increase the total project cost from US$303.1 million to US$371.4 million. The project outcome indicators are not impacted by the changes since all components cancelled from the loan have been completed using counterpart funding."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
