The project will comprise five major components: 1) water demand management to conserve water at the household level through a program of consumer awareness initiatives, through repairs to in-home plumbing, valves, taps and other fittings, and by rationalizing water use through meter installations and the implementation of a progressive water tariff; 2) operations and maintenance improvements to increase the amount of water available from the distribution system through a program of leak detection and repair, workshop and equipment acquisition, and at least a one year inventory of selected replacement valves and pipes; 3) supply improvements to improve the quantity and quality of water from the treatment works and enhancing the reliability of the distribution network ; 4) institutional capacity building to reorganize the water utility into a joint stock company; consolidating its offices; purchasing and installing new computers with new software; and developing training programs; and 5) preparation and implementation of a national policy framework for the water sector and preparing a regional master plan."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Azerbaijan!$!AZ","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"61,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sewerage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AZ","sectorcode":"WS,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development"],"themecode":"71","mjthemecode":"9,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":94},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20061011094516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061011094516","DocDate":"30-AUG-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01071204092423","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01071204092423","DocDate":"30-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01060104462861","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01060104462861","DocDate":"14-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123364295","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123364295","DocURL":"06-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123364094","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123364094","DocURL":"06-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123363993","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123363993","DocURL":"06-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123364396","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123364396","DocURL":"06-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123364396","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123364396","DocDate":"06-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123364094","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123364094","DocDate":"06-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123363993","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123363993","DocDate":"06-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123364295","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123364295","DocDate":"06-JUL-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e23ee5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23ee5_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23ee3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23ee3_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019105012","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019105012","DocDate":"06-JUN-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Azerbaijan"}},"facets":{}}
