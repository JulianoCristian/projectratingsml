The power distribution component will promote the expansion and rehabilitation of the urban distribution networks in JEPCO's and IDECO's concession areas and the electrification of 20 villages in the Governorates of Amman and Balka and 55 villages in the Governorate of Irbid. Other project components consist of petroleum exploration, energy conservation, sources for renewable energy, and energy planning. These components will provide consultant services, training and the acquisition of equipment to improve knowledge and development in the power subsector. The renewable energy component will specifically encourage development of alternative energy sources such as solar energy."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"JO","sectorcode":"PY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","code":"PY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925180542","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925180542","DocDate":"14-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a7a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a7a_1_0","DocDate":"20-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a79_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a79_1_0","DocDate":"20-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a78_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a78_1_0","DocDate":"20-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a76_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a76_1_0","DocDate":"20-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101757","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101757","DocDate":"30-NOV-1983"}],"countryname":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan"}},"facets":{}}
