It consists of: (i) the expansion of bulk water production and transmission facilities along the Mid-Atlantic Coast. These additional facilities will include the construction of two booster pumping stations along the existing transmission pipeline, a raw water pumping station with a capacity of 5 m3/sec., a 2.83 km pressure main linking the pumping station at the foot of the Bou Regreg dam with the treatment plant, a 5 m3/sec. treatment plant, a 2 km transmission main to Rabat, and an 82 km transmission main to Casablanca; (ii) the expansion of bulk water production and transmission facilities for the Greater Agadir area. This component will include: (a) equipping the existing Ahmar Boudhar well field with pumps and ancillary equipment; (b) constructing a transmission pipeline to Agadir and a treatment plant at Sidi Bou Shab; and (c) installing power transmission lines to the well field and the treatment station; (iii) funds for credit facilities to finance house connections of the low-income population in the project area; and (iv) studies. The implementation of the project does not pose any special risks."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"49,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924214916","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924214916","DocDate":"08-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924214832","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924214832","DocDate":"16-OCT-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e904_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e904_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e902_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e902_1_0","DocDate":"07-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902331357","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902331357","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333037_20111202003544","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20111202003544","DocDate":"01-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
