It would expand the rural education system and the teacher training facilities for instructors in rural education. The project would also provide training for three categories of workers presently in short supply in Upper Volta: project managers, building construction foremen and road and equipment maintenance personnel. Project supported improvements are expected to benefit the education of all those in the rural education system, approximately 22,000 at the beginning of the project."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"14,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BF","sectorcode":"EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924170626","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924170626","DocDate":"24-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902334425","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902334425","DocDate":"31-OCT-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd0c5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd0c5_1_0","DocDate":"23-OCT-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912424576","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912424576","DocDate":"30-SEP-1979"}],"countryname":"Burkina Faso"}},"facets":{}}
