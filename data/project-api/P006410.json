To that end, the proposed project comprises:  (i) civil works for the rehabilitation and periodic maintenance of State highways and associated consultant services for engineering design and construction supervision; (ii) equipment rehabilitation; (iii) a training program; and (iv) technical assistance for studies related to State transport policy, planning and operations, and highway management and research. Quantifiable project benefits will accrue to the economy at large, through vehicle operating costs savings.  In addition, intensified staff training and other institutional measures supported by the technical assistance are expected to improve the overall efficiency of the management and operations of the State transport sector and, in particular, the highway subsector."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"174,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BH,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39","mjthemecode":"4,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214161516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214161516","DocDate":"24-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042316415577","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042316415577","DocDate":"03-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032211502679","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032211502679","DocDate":"11-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091724","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091724","DocDate":"31-MAY-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926035513","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926035513","DocDate":"20-JAN-1987"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
