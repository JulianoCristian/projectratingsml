The project components are: 1: The Technical Assistance (TA) component of the GeoFund will address information and capacity barriers that retard the use of RER and geothermal energy. Assistance will be provided for: a) Region-wide and country specific capacity building to improve understanding of the nature of barriers and to find ways to remove them; b) Region-wide and country specific policy reviews concerning energy demand and use and amendments to legislation favorable to geothermal energy; and c) Project preparation and implementation. 2: Direct Investment Funding (DIF) will support project developers through providing low-cost loans, straight grants, or contingent grants where refund of a grant may be required under certain circumstances or the disbursement will be tied to fulfillment of pre-determined milestones. 3: The Geological Risk Insurance (GRI) component will help to mitigate the geological risks associated with geothermal energy exploration and operation."},"country_namecode":"Europe and Central Asia!$!7E","sector1":{"Name":"Other Renewable Energy","Percent":88},"sector2":{"Name":"Thermal Power Generation","Percent":6},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"4,530,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other Renewable Energy"},{"Name":"Thermal Power Generation"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"7E","sectorcode":"BC,LG,LR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,84,82,81","mjthemecode":"11,11,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other Renewable Energy","code":"LR"},{"name":"Thermal Power Generation","code":"LG"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":88},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":6},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000356161_20130319154040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130319154040","DocDate":"01-AUG-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20101001012715","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20101001012715","DocDate":"30-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000020953_20080430140214","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20080430140214","DocDate":"04-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000021321_2010052014573024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2010052014573024","DocDate":"21-NOV-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000090341_20061031114550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061031114550","DocDate":"24-OCT-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000090341_20061016142913","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061016142913","DocDate":"08-SEP-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20060627162846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060627162846","DocDate":"15-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20060606113959","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20060606113959","DocDate":"01-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20060912154203","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20060912154203","DocDate":"10-MAY-2006"}],"countryname":"Europe and Central Asia"}},"facets":{}}
