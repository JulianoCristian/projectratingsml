The project has a core component enhanced by two small supplementary components: (1) Restructuring services, the main component, comprises a direct credit line of the Ministry of Finance to about 250-270 eligible private enterprises to improve their operations and to obtain new market-based financing. (2) The restructuring promotion component will reinforce the core component by soliciting demand, improving the quality of enterprise sub-projects, supporting a marketing program, and developing targeted short workshops. (3) The market information improvement component will finance the development and dissemination of a database of domestic consulting firms, which will reinforce the core component by facilitating teaming arrangements between foreign and domestic consulting firms and transfers of skills and know-how to domestic firms."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"85,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,44","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050515140996","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050515140996","DocDate":"06-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102801","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102801","DocDate":"12-MAY-1997"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
