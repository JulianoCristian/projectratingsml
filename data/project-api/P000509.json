The central objective of the health program is to increase access of the population to quality basic health care focusing particularly on the most vulnerable groups of the population - children and women of child bearing age. Within the above framework, the Health and Safe Motherhood Project will support the development and implementation of policies and investments designed to: 1) strengthen capability at the central level to support regional health services; 2) provide assistance for health, nutritional and family planning services to the regions of Guera and Tandjile by establishing a network of district health facilities and by implementing skills upgrading programs for health personnel; 3) support the development and implementation of a national drug policy by developing the planning and management capacity of the Division of Pharmacy and creating a Central Purchasing Agency for essential and generic drugs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":61},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":39},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"18,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TD","sectorcode":"JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Rural development","Human development"],"themecode":"69,78,67,25","mjthemecode":"2,8,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":61},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":39}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02070904064050","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02070904064050","DocDate":"19-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121225791","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121225791","DocDate":"30-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121225791","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121225791","DocURL":"30-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b3cb_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b3cb_1_0","DocDate":"14-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006074410","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006074410","DocDate":"13-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006074708","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006074708","DocDate":"13-APR-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chad"}},"facets":{}}
