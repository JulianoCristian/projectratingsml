The current administration, in office since June 2004, has made good progress in moving forward its reform agenda, but emerging challenges associated with present global economic conditions compounded by the debt profile could threaten gains or hinder continued progress. The government's program for the period 2004-2009 was built on three main pillars: (i) accelerating broad-based, equitable economic growth and increase employment; (ii) improving equity through building human capital and expanding access to socioeconomic infrastructure, assets and markets; and (iii) enhancing security and reducing vulnerability. As a result of good performance, and despite a difficult political situation, progress has been made in each of these priority areas, with development targets being exceeded in many instances. In the medium-term, however, the country faces pressures on the fiscal front particularly in 2011 as a result of the unfavorable debt profile that year, in turn affecting the country's ability to make continued steady socio-economic progress in the medium-term."},"country_namecode":"Republic of El Salvador!$!SV","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":14},"sector4":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"450,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"SV","sectorcode":"EP,ES,JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"28,54,65,21,27","mjthemecode":"2,1,8,6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":57},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15},{"Name":"Education","Percent":14},{"Name":"Education","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120201233911","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120201233911","DocDate":"22-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011020817183889","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011020817183889","DocDate":"08-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000334955_20101015022242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20101015022242","DocDate":"29-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2009082511452563","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009082511452563","DocURL":"29-JAN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2009082511452563","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009082511452563","DocDate":"29-JAN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000350881_20090625110630","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20090625110630","DocDate":"10-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20081216121049","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20081216121049","DocDate":"09-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20081125104834","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20081125104834","DocDate":"13-NOV-2008"}],"countryname":"Republic of El Salvador"}},"facets":{}}
