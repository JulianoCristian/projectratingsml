Key agricultural development components comprise a land administration program, consisting of a new leasehold titling system, cadastral mapping and land surveying; strengthening of the Department of Agriculture's extension and land services; and agricultural planning, including market research and investment promotion.  The sugar industry component would support the engagement of a small management team to keep the mill operating, and to introduce much needed operational improvements."},"country_namecode":"St. Kitts and Nevis!$!KN","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":53},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":47},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"3,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KN","sectorcode":"BC,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Rural development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"36,75,25,43","mjthemecode":"4,2,10,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":53},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":47}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00020405360573","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00020405360573","DocDate":"07-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123283663","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283663","DocURL":"14-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123283462","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283462","DocURL":"14-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123283764","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283764","DocURL":"14-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123283663","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283663","DocDate":"14-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123283764","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283764","DocDate":"14-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123283462","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123283462","DocDate":"14-JUN-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929135053","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929135053","DocDate":"01-MAY-1991"}],"countryname":"St. Kitts and Nevis"}},"facets":{}}
