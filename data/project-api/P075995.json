The project has four components. The first component has two subcomponents. It promotes mitigation measures for reducing nutrient loads in water bodies. This component provides grants to entrepreneurs and enterprises under the Rural Investment and Services Project (RISP) for investing in environmentally sustainable agricultural practices; and trains rural advisory service providers in several nutrient reduction practices, including crop nutrient management, conservation tillage practices, crop rotation and tree planting o f buffer strips etc. The first component also promotes improving watershed management practices, particularly manure management practices, environmentally-friendly agricultural practices, shrub and tree planting, wetland restoration and sustainable management practices, and the monitoring of soil, water quality, and environmental impacts. The second component strengthens national policy, regulatory enforcement and national capacity. The third component supports public information campaigns and a replication strategy. The fourth component finances project management and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"General
