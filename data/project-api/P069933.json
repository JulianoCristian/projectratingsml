This project has four main components. 1) High Risk Group Interventions will limit the transmission of HIV infection among those populations with the highest prevalence of risk behaviors and from those groups to the general population. 2) Communications and Advocacy will create support for the HIV/AIDS prevention program by i) raising awareness, knowledge, and understanding among the general population about HIV/AIDS/STDs (sexually transmitted diseases); ii) encouraging the mobilization of resources and commitment for the implementation of the STD/AIDS Program; and iii) reducing stigmatization of HIV/AIDS affected people. 3) Blood Safety will facilitate the expansion of safe-blood initiatives. 4) Project Support and Institutional Strengthening will strengthen the STD/AIDS Program technical and managerial capacity with the aim of facilitating the rapid scaling up of HIV/AIDS prevention activities; monitor the progress of the STD/AIDS Program at large; evaluate the impact of these interventions; and conduct research that will enhance the impact of the STD/AIDS Program."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Executive Director's Statement,Executive Director's Statement,Executive Director's Statement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,57,69,88","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080730013730","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080730013730","DocDate":"10-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201172370","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201172370","DocURL":"26-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201172370","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201172370","DocDate":"26-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Executive Director's Statement (Executive Director's Statement),  Vol.1","DocType":"Executive Director's Statement","EntityID":"000456286_20140409165928","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20140409165928","DocDate":"11-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Executive Director's Statement (Executive Director's Statement),  Vol.1","DocType":"Executive Director's Statement","EntityID":"000456286_20140409165610","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20140409165610","DocDate":"11-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Executive Director's Statement (Executive Director's Statement),  Vol.1","DocType":"Executive Director's Statement","EntityID":"000456286_20140409165739","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20140409165739","DocDate":"11-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00112805302444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112805302444","DocDate":"17-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00051105313620","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051105313620","DocDate":"17-MAR-2000"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
