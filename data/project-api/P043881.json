The primary objectives of the project are to achieve, and increase the economic use of irrigation though changes the Land Reclamation Agency's (LRA's) behavior, to increase agricultural productivity in the project area. Through the following components, the project will: 1) rehabilitate main distribution systems in two stages, within which the schemes to be rehabilitated would be chosen based on the likely long-term economic viability. The criteria for schemes selection are: static pumping head (less than 70m), advanced state of water user associations (WUAs) development, and system transfer, strong demand, secure water sources, and, no environmental, nor social impediments; 2) support institutional reform in land reclamation, specifically through technical assistance (TA) and equipment to develop an appropriate management information system (MIS) system, supported by international and national specialists, for the Land Reclamation Agency (LRA) staff. In addition, TA will support the preparation of a business, and asset disposal plan, focusing on those elements with commercial potential. The component will also support the Land Reclamation Directorate within the Ministry of Agriculture - MAFWE - by assisting with the development of procedures to review service charges, and performance monitoring, and, in developing a database for monitoring WUAs development. Further training and TA will be provided to WUAs; 3) support technologies for reducing energy consumption for irrigation, through a technical study that confirm its economic and financial viability.
