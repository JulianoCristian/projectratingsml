This strategy would lead to substantial increases in food production and a reduction in the economy's vulnerability to price changes and market constraints on coffee, thereby assisting the country in reducing overproduction and costly stock build-up of coffee.  The project would accelerate significantly the borrower's ongoing diversification efforts and help make diversification a more self-sustaining process through provision of:  (i) credit for agricultural production, processing and marketing; and (ii) related support services, including technical assistance, applied agricultural research and a price and marketing information system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other agriculture","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other agriculture"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"AY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other agriculture","code":"AY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716150523","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716150523","DocDate":"30-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99af7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99af7_1_0","DocDate":"27-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e99af6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99af6_1_0","DocDate":"27-JUN-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
