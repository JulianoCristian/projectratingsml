To assist in achieving this goal, the primary objective of the project is to improve and strengthen national and local institutions engaged in the planning, financing, design, and operation of urban transport systems.  In addition, the project will help to increase the efficiency of traffic and transport operations, to preserve the urban transport infrastructure through better maintenance and consequently to assist in reducing user costs and deferring new transport investments.  The project is also expected to contribute to poverty alleviation by facilitating access to public transport by the poor.  The project consists of two parts:  a) an institutional development and policy program; and b) an infrastructure and equipment investment program at the municipal level.  Part A consists of the following components:  (i) an institutional strengthening program for the National Urban Transport Fund (FONTUR); (ii) an institutional strengthening program at the municipal level; (iii) a national urban transport sector training program; (iv) a traffic police program; (v) policy studies; and (vi) preparation of city subprojects.  Part B will provide resources to individual municipalities for urban transport subprojects.  Municipal subprojects will comprise investments in traffic and transport infrastructure and equipment, and associated maintenance programs."},"country_namecode":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela!$!VE","sector1":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":71},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"VE","sectorcode":"BH,BC,TZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Urban development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,73,71","mjthemecode":"9,9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":71},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03011404020926","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03011404020926","DocDate":"24-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200120317","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200120317","DocURL":"28-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200120418","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200120418","DocURL":"28-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200120619","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200120619","DocURL":"28-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200120116","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200120116","DocURL":"28-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200120720","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200120720","DocURL":"28-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200120619","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200120619","DocDate":"28-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200120116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200120116","DocDate":"28-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200120317","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200120317","DocDate":"28-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200120418","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200120418","DocDate":"28-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200120720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200120720","DocDate":"28-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003205251","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003205251","DocDate":"30-SEP-1993"}],"countryname":"Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela"}},"facets":{}}
