The principle project goals are to: (a) adopt multiple-use management of forest lands; (b) involve local people in managing the forest to meet their basic requirements, as well as in increasing the level of economic activity through social forestry practices; (c) rehabilitate degraded forests to maintain their economic and environmental benefits; and (d) improve the planning and implementation capacity of government organizations. The project consists of four components: (i) national forest management involving the planning and management of selected forests by the government; (ii) social forestry involving rural communities in managing forest areas allocated to them, and improving farm output by introducing tree planting on private lands; (iii) afforestation/reforestation involving rehabilitation of degraded forests on government lands; and (iv) institutional strengthening including support for improved planning and policy development, training and capacity building of the Department of Forestry (DOF) at the field as well as central level."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Bhutan!$!BT","sector1":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"5,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"BT","sectorcode":"BZ,AT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,25,76,82,79","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,11,10,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030520131741","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030520131741","DocDate":"28-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123320298","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123320298","DocURL":"11-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123320298","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123320298","DocDate":"11-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123320499","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123320499","DocDate":"11-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123320499","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123320499","DocURL":"11-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e12670_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e12670_1_0","DocDate":"06-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004062442","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004062442","DocDate":"07-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004062634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004062634","DocDate":"07-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135339","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135339","DocDate":"24-JUN-1992"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Bhutan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
