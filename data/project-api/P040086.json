The project components are four. The first strengthens second and third tier indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian membership organizations in 1) subproject participatory planning, preparation, implementation, and maintenance; 2) financial management and administration; 3) cultural patrimony; and 4) human resources development, including basic legal training. This component focuses on seven small ethnic groups in danger of extinction, and also finances goods and equipment and incremental operating costs. The second component 1) titles and regularizes land tenure rights in productive, forestry, and protected areas; 2) purchases land; 3) diagnoses and elaborates an action plan for community-owned irrigation systems; and 4) supports a program of legal reforms. It also strengthens public sector agencies. The third component finances demand-driven small-scale investments in natural resources management; community-based economic infrastructure; social infrastructure; and economic projects and micro-enterprises.
