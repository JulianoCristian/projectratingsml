Annual enrollment is expected to total about 560. Project components would include civil works related to campus development, together with the provision of furnishings, equipment and vehicles. Management of the Institute would be contracted to an international firm or consortium of firms experienced in management training. This firm would provide 24 man-years of technical assistance to fill six senior staff positions at the Institute. In addition, it would be responsible for establishing and operating the Institute, recruiting senior staff, training Nigerian teaching staff and establishing an evaluation system. Another project component would consist of fellowships for training up to 24 teaching staff outside Nigeria. In addition, 25 man-months of support consultant services would be contracted to assist with course development work, evaluate program results and advise on future development of the facilities."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other agriculture","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"9,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other agriculture"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"AY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other agriculture","code":"AY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e478_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e478_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e976a5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976a5_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e976a4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976a4_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e976a0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976a0_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e9769f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9769f_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912194235","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912194235","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902313761","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902313761","DocDate":"31-MAY-1979"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
