The primary objectives of the project are to: 1) rehabilitate basic small-scale infrastructure that can result in immediate improvements of the living conditions of the poorest among the population; 2) strengthen the capacity of private, small-scale contractors and other micro-businesses so that they can benefit directly or indirectly from contracts financed by the Armenian Social Investment Fund (ASIF), and build the capacity of local government staff and communities so that they can prepare and implement small projects; 3) generate employment through financing of labor-intensive public works; and 4) build greater capacity for policy makers to monitor and analyze trends in the level and structure of poverty in Armenia. The project has four components: 1) financing of ASIF microprojects to support the rehabilitation of small-scale infrastructure; 2) institutional support for the ASIF; 3) capacity building of small contractors, implementing agencies and communities; and 4) support to the government for monitoring the living standards of the population."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Armenia!$!AM","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":7},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AM","sectorcode":"JB,BH,YZ,BC,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Urban development","Rural development","Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"41,53,78,71,54","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,9,10,6,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":68},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01061404093081","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01061404093081","DocDate":"08-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123375746","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123375746","DocURL":"15-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123375746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123375746","DocDate":"15-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23f49_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23f49_1_0","DocDate":"09-NOV-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019114047","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019114047","DocDate":"23-OCT-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Armenia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
