The stripped gas would be principally as fuel for electric power generation and cement manufacture where it would replace fuel oil and high value diesel oil and as a feed stock for a fertilizer plant where it would replace naphtha. Specifically the project would consist of: (i) three gas gathering stations for associated gas, (ii) a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and condensate recovery plant, (iii) compression facilities and pipelines and related services, (iv) sector studies, training and technical assistance; and (v) engineering and consulting services for a Cairo gas distribution project."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"75,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"GS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","code":"GS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924215542","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924215542","DocDate":"30-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902332072","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902332072","DocDate":"30-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e92c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e92c_1_0","DocDate":"19-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e92b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e92b_1_0","DocDate":"19-JUN-1979"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
