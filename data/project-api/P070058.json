The components will: 1) support the establishment, and strengthening of regulatory entities; revise tariff structures; develop financial models, regulatory accounting, and auditing information systems, and, develop a competitiveness environment to foster private sector involvement across sectors. Standard procedures will be implemented to reflect environmental concerns, and, strategies will be designed to increase access to the poor. Training programs will include study tours, seminars, and workshops; 2) develop additional regulation, and expand the previous component work, specifically for the water, and sanitation sector, including the preparation of medium sized concessions; 3) support the energy sector, focusing on the electricity, gas, and petroleum sub-sectors, by strengthening regulatory accounting. A strategic expansion of electricity quality services to the poor will be implemented. Gas operational regulations will be expanded, and, the petroleum liberalization of the downstream market should increase competition; 4) strengthen the regulatory oversight of anti-competitive, and market foreclosure practices in the telecommunications sector, and, design policy schemes to foster efficient provision of universal postal services; and, 5) assist in the internal reform of the National Railroad Authority, and, design integrated rail regulations, including interconnection aspects, and traffic control."},"country_namecode":"Oriental Republic of
