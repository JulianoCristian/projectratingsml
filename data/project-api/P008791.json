The PAL program reflects the Government's overarching objectives of establishing solid economic growth, reducing poverty and joining the European Union. These objectives will be addressed by focusing on five key, cross-cutting themes: establishing public sector accountability; instilling financial discipline; instituting regulatory reforms; following good social and environment risk management practices; and ensuring property rights. In addition, the PAL provides continuity with previous adjustment operations b y ensuring sustained progress on the structural reforms begun under Private Sector Adjustment Loans 1 and 2, while at the same time introducing a new program of phased public sector and regulatory reforms that emphasizes institutional development and effective implementation. The program is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on reforming core public sector institutions and processes. The second targets the public- private interface and regulation of markets."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"TZ,FZ,YZ,LZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,34,27,25,43","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,2,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080730013536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080730013536","DocDate":"24-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060103093659","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060103093659","DocDate":"05-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010031816302467","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031816302467","DocURL":"27-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010031816302467","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031816302467","DocDate":"27-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20040826152854","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040826152854","DocDate":"06-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000012009_20040716151522","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040716151522","DocDate":"26-FEB-2004"}],"countryname":"Romania","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
