It would provide for the installation of two 500 MW coal/oil-fired units and associated auxiliary equipment; coal handling and storage facilities, fuel oil tanks, ash system and storage area; a fuel unloading dock for ships of up to 100,000 DWT displacement; a pumping station and a 17 km steel pipe to transport fresh water to the station; and a 160 km double circuit, 345 KV transmission line between the power station and Seoul, and related terminal substations and management consulting services. The project will enable KECO to meet part of the increased demand of the interconnected system from 1984. It is expected that the project will help to improve KECO's planning, organization, finances and the structure of electricity rates. An important benefit is the introduction of advanced technology to Korea, through the participation of local manufacturers in association with foreign companies, in the manufacture of some of the main equipment. No major risks are expected to be encountered during the construction of the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"115,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Thermal"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"PT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Thermal","code":"PT"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924223721","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924223721","DocDate":"31-DEC-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b0822b8b27_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0822b8b27_1_0","DocDate":"12-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b0822b8b26_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0822b8b26_1_0","DocDate":"12-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902340568","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902340568","DocDate":"30-NOV-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912473260","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912473260","DocDate":"30-NOV-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
