As a consequence of about 15 years of civil disturbances, the area has suffered not only a high loss of life but also the destruction of essential infrastructure and a precipitous decline in social services.  Moreover, it has yet to receive development assistance comparable to that provided in Southern Uganda.  The project will provide support for the short and medium-term reconstruction of essential economic and social infrastructure for the resumption of productive activities in the Region.  It will contribute to poverty alleviation and address the particular concerns of women.  It will provide assistance in seven sectors:  agriculture, education, feeder roads, highways, telecommunications, urban, and water supply and sanitation.  It will also include a community action progam providing a social fund for community-initiated micro projects in Arua, Moyo, and Nebbi Districts and assistance to strengthen the capacity of local government agencies to plan and manage the long-term reconstruction and rehabilitation program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"71,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"AB,WC,CT,JB,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Human development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,65,78,62,77","mjthemecode":"10,7,10,8,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":43},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":28},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":17},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":7},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99061606182126","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99061606182126","DocDate":"30-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121093988","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121093988","DocURL":"12-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121094089","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121094089","DocDate":"12-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121093988","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121093988","DocDate":"12-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121094089","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121094089","DocURL":"12-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e394e6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e394e6_1_0","DocDate":"05-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e394e4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e394e4_1_0","DocDate":"05-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002101229","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002101229","DocDate":"06-APR-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
