The project aims to assist the Government of Nigeria to achieve its goal of interrupting transmission of wild poliovirus by the end of 2003 and sustaining these efforts throughout the period 2003-05, through effective oral polio vaccine (OPV) coverage of the target population. There are three project components. The first component provides adequate supplies of OPV for eradication campaigns, and immunizes all children under five years of age. Vaccines will be procured through UNICEF for the supplementary immunization activities carried out during 2003 and 2004 and first quarter of 2005. The second component, supplemental operations, comprises three main areas: cold chain, social mobilization, and training. These are integral to the success of the program as the major operational strategy is to reach every child (0-59 months) through a house-to-house delivery of OPV. Special attention is given to insure coverage of hard to reach and/or resistant populations. The third component provides support for epidemiological and laboratory surveillance. An Expert Review Committee of national and international experts meets periodically to assess progress. It produces an analysis of the situation of polio eradication in Nigeria and detailed recommendations intended to provide strategic directions to the eradication activities in the coming period."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Child
