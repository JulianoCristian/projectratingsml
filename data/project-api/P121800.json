The policy areas that are included in the proposed DPL promote low-carbon development for: (1) increasing renewable energy supply, promoting energy efficiency through cogeneration, reducing gas flaring and venting, and piloting the reform of the rural agricultural electricity subsidy; (2) improving the efficiency of the vehicle fleet and road transport operations in Mexico; (3) strengthening the market for energy-efficient housing; and (4) mainstreaming climate change considerations into land-use and forestry activities. In addition, the proposed operation will contribute to the efforts of the Mexico government to: (i) facilitate Mexico's involvement in the international carbon market, and (ii) implement Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), in particular the ones adopted in the PECC."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":37},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":19},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"401,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Housing construction"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Summary of Discussion,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"YC,AT,TZ,LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,82,84","mjthemecode":"11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":37},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":25},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20130724104142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130724104142","DocDate":"30-APR-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012070916375343","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012070916375343","DocDate":"09-JUL-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011081011200998","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011081011200998","DocDate":"10-AUG-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022219051662","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022219051662","DocDate":"22-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000362596_2011041116083127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000362596_2011041116083127","DocDate":"08-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000334955_20101125015424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20101125015424","DocDate":"23-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000350881_20101102100039","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20101102100039","DocDate":"25-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000003596_20101013085817","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000003596_20101013085817","DocDate":"12-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100909095054","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100909095054","DocDate":"27-AUG-2010"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
