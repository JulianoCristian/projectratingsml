The project consists of three components. First, provincial subprojects will include: a) essential health care interventions; b) developing new health care organization, financing and developing managerial models to create provincial integrated delivery systems; c) institutional strengthening to reorganize and enhance the capacity of health facilities; and d) training and continuing education of health personnel. Second, the policy development studies component will finance workshops and study tours to assess the feasibility of additional policy and institutional reforms. Third, the project administration component will finance the administrative and operating costs of the Project Coordination Unit."},"country_namecode":"Dominican Republic!$!DO","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"DO","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,69,57,67,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":94},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20041230093754","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041230093754","DocDate":"23-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123151585","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123151585","DocURL":"09-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123151384","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123151384","DocDate":"09-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123151183","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123151183","DocURL":"09-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123151384","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123151384","DocURL":"09-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123151585","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123151585","DocDate":"09-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123151183","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123151183","DocDate":"09-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980217140157","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980217140157","DocDate":"15-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184634","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Dominican Republic"}},"facets":{}}
