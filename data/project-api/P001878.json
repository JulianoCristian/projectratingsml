Direct investments in the tea factories, MTDA offices, stores, equipment, and tea plantings account for nearly 90 percent of the project costs. The remaining costs would be expatriate salaries and other administration expenses of MTDA. The proposed IDA credit would finance US$5.2 million (three-fourths of total project costs) representing the estimated foreign exchange component of US$2.4 million (34 percent of total costs) and US$2.8 million of local costs. Government would finance the remaining US$1.7 million of local costs (one fourth of total costs)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mauritius!$!MU","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"MU","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912572677","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912572677","DocDate":"31-DEC-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903181431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903181431","DocDate":"31-MAR-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903202444","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903202444","DocDate":"31-MAR-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081de2fc3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de2fc3_1_0","DocDate":"30-MAR-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de2cec_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de2cec_1_0","DocDate":"30-MAR-1971"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mauritius"}},"facets":{}}
