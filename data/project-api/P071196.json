The project will finance the Government's purchases of electricity, and associated fuel from short-term independent power producers, and fuel suppliers while the power supply crisis lasts. The project will also finance working capital requirements, for fuel purchases arising from the drought-induced changes in the power generation mix, between hydro, and technical sources, and from reduced revenues caused by local shedding. The project will be beneficial in preventing severe economic contraction, and in providing fast-track reforms in power transmission, and distribution systems, to create a more competitive, and private sector-led system, as agreed under the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Nonetheless, risks include the potential of unrealized net revenues from the domestic share of project financing, which is to be derived from the collection from final consumers; possible coordination problems between the power company, and independent power producers, which may delay timely power connections; and, possible misappropriation of funds. However, well established management practices may well reduce those risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":58},"sector2":{"Name":"Power","Percent":42},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"72,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"LD,LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"52,39","mjthemecode":"4,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":58},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":42}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0208030401046","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0208030401046","DocDate":"19-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201163536","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201163536","DocURL":"27-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201163335","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201163335","DocURL":"27-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201163637","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201163637","DocURL":"27-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201163536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201163536","DocDate":"27-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201163335","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201163335","DocDate":"27-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201163637","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201163637","DocDate":"27-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000094946_00101306250223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00101306250223","DocDate":"14-SEP-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
