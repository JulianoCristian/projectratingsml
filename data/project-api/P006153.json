The project aims to:  (a) develop the capacity of the newly established Bolivian Export Foundation (BEF) as a private, autonomous, self-financing organization, to establish financially sound, agro-based subsidiaries and joint ventures with small- and medium-scale entrepreneurs and investors; (b) introduce improved technology to expand agricultural production, in an environmentally sound manner; and (c) generate employment and capital accumulation in order to improve the incomes and standard of living of poor farmers, women's groups, urban and rural laborers.  The project finances three main components:  (a) the operations of the BEF, including its enterprise investment program, which initially is expected to consist of five joint ventures and subsidiaries; (b) the employment of a management firm to provide four experts for the BEF; and (c) the provision by the BEF of technical assistance for carrying out market research and feasibility studies for identifying new investment opportunities for export of additional agricultural products from Bolivia."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of
