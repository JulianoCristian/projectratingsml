Some 30,000 low-income families would directly benefit from project works. Average annual family income for beneficiaries of irrigation and drainage projects is expected to increase from about US$500 before the project to about US$2,300 at full development four to five years later. Incomes of beneficiaries of the livestock development subprojects are expected to increase from an estimated average level of about US$200 without the project to about US$1,400 at full development, eight to ten years later."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925025548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925025548","DocDate":"27-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000334955_20090129054551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090129054551","DocDate":"27-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902315999","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902315999","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912413077","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912413077","DocDate":"31-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3df_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3df_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e3de_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e3de_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1978"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
