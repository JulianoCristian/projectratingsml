Support for coal sector reform was included as a priority within that pillar, which includes the following assessment: \"The Bank will assist Poland's enterprise restructuring plans primarily through continuation of the assistance to the coal reform program, begun in 1999. The Program comprises: the economic objective - to improve profitability, and financial liquidity of the sector, to achieve capability in meeting the regular liability payments, including payments of environmental fees; and, the social objective - to mitigate the social impacts of program implementation, and of sector restructuring. The first component provides support for CY04 costs for the severance packages to be paid to underground workers, under the 2003-2006 Program, enabling pre-retirement benefits of 75 percent of wages for a period of up to 3 years, until eligible for a miners pension. Similarly, the second component provides support for CY04 costs for severance packages to surface workers, providing alternative employment at a salary of 75 percent of present wages. Finally, the third component supports CY04 costs for ongoing commitments to severance payments from previous Miners' Social Packages under the 1998-2002 Program, provided for up to five years."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Mining and other extractive","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Mining and other extractive"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Program Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"EV,JB,LB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"43,51,87,56,41","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,6,6,6,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Mining and other extractive","code":"LB"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":50},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070718111521","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070718111521","DocDate":"14-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004102118441688","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004102118441688","DocDate":"14-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004102118441688","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004102118441688","DocURL":"14-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20040312095725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040312095725","DocDate":"10-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20030611165259","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20030611165259","DocDate":"11-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_03040904023025","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03040904023025","DocDate":"01-APR-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
