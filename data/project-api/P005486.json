The project will help:  (a) achieve a key transition in CNCA's institutional development by supporting CNCA's conversion to a more diversified bank with increased managerial autonomy, geared to serve agriculture and to reach small farmers, young entrepreneurs/graduates and non-farm clients (notably women) in poverty-related areas; (b) promote private investment in viable projects, including agro-industries with export potential; (c) increase domestic resource mobilization and secure the rural banking system through a pilot drought relief fund/crop insurance system drawing on best practices worldwide; and (d) develop banking and technical skills needed to manage the changed organization and special features of a sustainable rural finance operation. Specifically, the project will fund:  (a) medium- and long-term credit to private farmers and investors to finance a wide range of investments including water conservation measures in irrigation, farm equipment, tree crop and livestock development, storage facilities, land improvement, greenhouses, agro-processing plants, coastal fisheries, rural housing, forestry and environment protection, and rural non-farm investments; and (b) project-related training, consulting services for the strengthening of CNCA management and planning and to manage the effects of drought.  A mid-term review will assess progress made during implementation."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":70},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Housing construction","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":4},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Housing construction"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"BC,FE,YC,YB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,51,44,41","mjthemecode":"4,4,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Housing construction","code":"YC"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":70},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":15},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":10},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":4},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123001805","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123001805","DocURL":"13-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123001704","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123001704","DocURL":"13-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123001805","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123001805","DocDate":"13-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123001704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123001704","DocDate":"13-DEC-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005110354","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005110354","DocDate":"29-OCT-1993"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
