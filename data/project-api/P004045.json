Acquisition of these items would increase KNR's capacity to meet traffic requirements and would help to improve KNR's efficiency by reducing operating costs. In particular, the new freight cars and diesel locomotives would meet present shortages and provide for expected traffic growth in the immediate future; the telecommunication equipment would replace obsolete and over-age installations which are now unreliable and insufficient to meet operational requirements; new track maintenance equipment would help to modernize maintenance operations and to improve the quality of maintenance work."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"55,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912503897","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912503897","DocDate":"17-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190316533","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190316533","DocDate":"30-APR-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081da5708_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da5708_1_0","DocDate":"14-APR-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903321114","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903321114","DocDate":"31-MAR-1970"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
