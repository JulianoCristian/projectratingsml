It would strengthen the agencies involved in smallholder rubber production and provide adequate replanting inputs and incentives. The project also includes improvement in rubber processing standards, expanded training facilities and technical assistance. The project faces no major risk. The problem of constrained implementation capacity has been addressed by building up replanting targets slowly over the project implementation period."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"16,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Project Performance Assessment Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000009265_3961029214416","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961029214416","DocDate":"30-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925120622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925120622","DocDate":"30-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e041bd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e041bd_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902350890","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902350890","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912484795","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912484795","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
