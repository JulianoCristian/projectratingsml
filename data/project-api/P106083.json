Within this context, the PRSG-4 is expected to help the GoR to : 1) maintain a stable macroeconomic framework, put in place reforms to ease the human capital and infrastructure constraints to growth, with the aim of creating a strong basis for private sector-led economic growth, driven by agricultural transformation, promotion of exports, deepening of the financial sector, and the use o f information communications technology; 2) strengthen further the linkages between strategic planning and the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), by broadening the focus on service delivery to include more strongly the agriculture, transport, and financial sectors, while continuing to maintain and deepen the progress made in the education, health, water, and energy sectors; and 3) continue improving governance and transparency through capacity support to enable implementation of completed reforms to financial management, and the budget and procurement frameworks, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the process of fiscal decentralization. Expected benefits are as follows: 1) in creased access to infrastructure services while continuing to consolidate and improve access to education and health services to increase the supply of skilled labor in the workforce; 2) improved efficiency of spending by supporting reforms to strengthen the MTEF and public procurement process; 3) strengthened capacity to implement through support to civil service reforms to improve ministerial structures and provide incentives to staff, increase skills of the civil service and reduce turn-over."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Cinqui\u00e8me don \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le cinqui\u00e8me don \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 (PRSG-5) continue \u00e0 aider le Gouvernement rwandais (GR) \u00e0 prendre des mesures pour encourager une croissance multisectorielle dans le contexte de r\u00e9formes et d\u2019une d\u00e9centralisation plus efficaces.
