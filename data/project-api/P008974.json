The project would improve the implementation and management of provincial extension systems through diagnosing farmers' problems, decentralizing and mobilizing project staff, and providing training and strong technical support to field staff. To improve extension staff's contact with farmers, the project would provide housing in the villages, vehicles and equipment. It would provide additional specialist staff and training to widen the range of technical support given to field staff, and assist them in their work. The project would support research institutes and develop strong linkages between extension, research and farmers through diagnostic surveys. It would formulate responses to the needs of homogenous categories of farmers, monitor farmers' uptake and reactions to extension recommendations, and transfer research-based recommendations to reduce the degradation of Turkey's environment and agricultural resources. It would initiate a pilot program to train women engaged in agriculture, and a pilot program of mobile veterinary units to supply improved livestock health services in the villages. Finally, it would provide technical assistance to help implement the project, and funds to prepare a follow-up project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"63,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development"],"themecode":"78","mjthemecode":"10,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99060411085342","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99060411085342","DocDate":"30-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041510010339","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041510010339","DocDate":"30-MAR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928104903","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928104903","DocDate":"22-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960928104712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928104712","DocDate":"22-FEB-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
