The additional financing will help to cover a portion of the funding gap identified during project appraisal and enable the implementation of components one and two to deliver basic health and hospital services to the vast majority of the poor (84 percent) and of the overall population (80 percent) who live in rural areas. This is fully consistent with the Crisis Response Window (CRW) objective of providing financial assistance to protect core spending on health.
