It aims to support all four pillars of the SEDP, namely, fostering business development, ensuring social inclusion, managing natural resources, and strengthening governance. The credit is the third in a programmatic series of five annual single-tranche operations (PRSCs 6-10). This series follows the first cycle of five operations (PRSCs 1-5). The PRSCs are well-suited to support the implementation of the SEDP, as the cross-cutting nature of the policy dialogue conducted through PRSCs encourages taking a holistic view of the reform agenda, and promotes collaboration among line ministries and government agencies. The annual programming is demanding, but provides the government with predictability for planning purposes, and also helps keep the reform momentum. The PRSCs are designed to be forward-looking. The negotiation of each PRSC operation includes reaching an agreement on a list of policy measures that will, in principle, be supported by the following operation. These policy measures, or 'triggers,' are grounded in the SEDP 2006-2010 as well as other key documents and strategies, and are considered to have strategic importance to attain the SEDP objectives. Triggers are very limited in number. They are not conditions but rather a framework to guide the policy dialogue in the subsequent operation. It is understood that some triggers may not be fully met while others may be exceeded. In addition to the 'triggers,' the policy dialogue conducted under PRSCs addresses a broader set of issues, articulated as 'benchmarks.' These benchmarks are reported to convey the scope of the reforms being implemented. They are not part of the legal agreement, although they strengthen the implementation of the "},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":15},"theme4":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":10},"totalcommamt":"350,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Banking"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"FA,BZ,YZ,JB,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management","Economic management","Human development"],"themecode":"65,21,54,30,42","mjthemecode":"4,2,6,1,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20130417110933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130417110933","DocDate":"14-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000171540_2010090808360698","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010090808360698","DocDate":"08-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000171540_2010093011274972","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010093011274972","DocDate":"08-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2009112414100072","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009112414100072","DocURL":"07-AUG-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2009112414100072","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2009112414100072","DocDate":"07-AUG-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20090616005314","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090616005314","DocDate":"08-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000013944_20090303155511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000013944_20090303155511","DocDate":"05-FEB-2009"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}},"facets":{}}
