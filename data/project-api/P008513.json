To achieve these objectives, the project will focus on: 1) organizing sheep and wool farmers into farmers' associations or groups through which essential services can be channeled; 2) developing a competitive marketing structure with incentives for production of quality lambs and wool for premium prices; 3) increasing sheep and wool productivity through establishing training and advisory services for private farmers and supporting selected breeding activities; and 4) developing and disseminating sustainable pasture management techniques among sheep producers. The project consists of three main components: 1) sheep private enterprise development, including: (a) sheep producers' groups/associations; (b) regional sheep breeders associations; (c) Kyrgyz sheep breeders associations; (d) wool and lamb marketing; and (e) wool testing; 2) development of livestock support services, which comprises: (a) project implementation unit; (b) agricultural training and advisory services; and (c) animal health services; and 3) sheep breeding research support involving sheep breeding research and pastures land resources."},"country_namecode":"Kyrgyz Republic!$!KG","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":36},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":28},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"11,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"KG","sectorcode":"BC,AJ,YA,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,75,78,83","mjthemecode":"11,10,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":36},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":28},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":28},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20030707162120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030707162120","DocDate":"25-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123395931","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123395931","DocURL":"13-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123395730","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123395730","DocDate":"13-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123395730","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123395730","DocURL":"13-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123395931","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123395931","DocDate":"13-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961022104536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961022104536","DocDate":"23-APR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062115135305","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062115135305","DocDate":"08-APR-1994"}],"countryname":"Kyrgyz Republic"}},"facets":{}}
