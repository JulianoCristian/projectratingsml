It will also provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Urban Development and the Environment to help develop management programs for other metropolitan areas and to the Salvador Metropolitan Development Agency to strengthen management of the SMR. The sub-loans would finance the following investments: upgrading of low-income communities, infrastructure, municipal services, and productive activities (site preparation, construction and equipment). The project will focus on strengthening the capabilities of the SMR to plan, finance and execute priority projects on the basis of criteria acceptable to the Bank. It will improve the management of municipal finances by strengthening revenue generating mechanisms including cost recovery. It will also introduce sub-loans to Brazil's Northeast, an area that has traditionally relied on federal and state grants for municipal services."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":22},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":45},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":18},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"55,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BH,YZ,JB,TA,WZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Urban development","Urban development","Urban development"],"themecode":"73,74,72,71,57","mjthemecode":"7,9,9,9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":22},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":45},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":9},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":18},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092416","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092416","DocDate":"30-APR-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165207","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165207","DocDate":"31-MAR-1986"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
