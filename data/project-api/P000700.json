It will also; (v) improve headquarters support services to the stations; and (vi) provide technical assistance and strengthen training programs.  The primary focus of the project will be on field crop and coffee research in high potential areas, since this research offers opportunities for quicker returns than would be obtainable from research in other subsectors. Increased crop production in high potential areas would help stimulate economy-wide growth and also to generate surplus food to cope with frequent shortages in drought-prone areas."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"22,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"AR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Research","code":"AR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007211712","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007211712","DocDate":"01-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121155933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121155933","DocDate":"14-DEC-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121160134","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121160134","DocDate":"14-DEC-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121160335","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121160335","DocDate":"14-DEC-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05cac_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05cac_1_0","DocDate":"11-SEP-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151127","DocDate":"31-AUG-1984"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
