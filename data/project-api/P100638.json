The changes to the project are designed to focus the project on key activities needed to achieve the development objective within the original closing date given project implementation delays. It is to: 1) under component one, cancel non-core activities and associated loan funds amounting to \u00804.3 million; 2) under component two, reduce the scope of activities under the socio-economic guidance sub component and reallocate \u00800.9 million for the scaling up of the integrated agricultural offices and \u00801.04 million to component three; 3) under component three, support follow up actions identified under a functional review of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), in the total amount of \u00801.25 million; and 4) introduce changes to the  results framework, project costs and implementation schedule resulting from the restructuring.
