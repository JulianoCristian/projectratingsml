The project will provide a line of credit and technical assistance to FEC to help finance revenue-earning infrastructure projects. In view of the insufficient appraisal and supervision capability of FEC and the inadequate personnel and financial resources of the local communes, the project is designed on a pilot basis, focusing on strengthening FEC as an institution. The project will increase the availability of water supply and sewerage, electricity, urban development and transportation, as well as warehouses, markets and slaughterhouses in local communes dispersed throughout Morocco."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other finance","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"16,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other finance"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"FY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other finance","code":"FY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925155110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925155110","DocDate":"14-NOV-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902414596","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902414596","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901004259","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901004259","DocDate":"30-APR-1983"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
