In addition, it will also help build up the capacity of SEPAs (State Environmental Protection Agencies).  The main objectives of the National Industrial Pollution Control Project are to: a) improve public health and living conditions of the population concentrated in and around industrialized areas; b) support participating states in establishing an integrated approach in solving pollution problems in a cost-effective manner; c) familiarize the banking system with financing free-standing pollution control investments; d) strengthen the institutional capabilities of active SEPAs; and e) strengthen BNDES's (the Banco National de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social) ability to process free-standing pollution abatement loans.  In addition, it will finance investments in existing industrial facilities to control all types of industrial pollution -- air, water, and hazardous waste.  Subprojects may include the following discharge reduction schemes: 1) end-of-pipe controls; 2) in-process modifications; and 3) recycling/recovery."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":1},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BH,FA,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Human development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,70,82","mjthemecode":"11,8,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":98},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":1},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980624142738","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624142738","DocDate":"24-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122515056","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122515056","DocURL":"21-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122514955","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122514955","DocDate":"21-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122514754","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122514754","DocURL":"21-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122514754","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122514754","DocDate":"21-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122515056","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122515056","DocDate":"21-SEP-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002063342","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002063342","DocDate":"20-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002063208","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002063208","DocDate":"20-APR-1992"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
