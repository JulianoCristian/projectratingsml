More specifically, the project will aim to: 1) develop measures to improve the quality and efficiency of lower secondary education and test them at a limited number of schools in order to gain acceptance before extending the reform to the rest of the system; 2) improve the school environment by supporting rehabilitation and repair of schools; and 3) enhance the ability of national and regional institutions to design, plan for, and implement sustainable education reforms. The project will have the following three components: 1) educational program quality, including support to school management, training of principals, deputy principals and department heads, introduction of a common curriculum, provision of textbooks and other instructional materials, in-service teacher training, supervision and performance monitoring; 2) school environment comprising a pilot schools subcomponent and an emergency school repair subcomponent; and 3) national and regional institutional strengthening including institutional strengthening, project management, budget planning, organization and management, nationwide physical facilities survey, school information system and a social awareness campaign."},"country_namecode":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana!$!GY","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":24},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":9},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"17,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GY","sectorcode":"BH,ET,BC,EP,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,57,65,78","mjthemecode":"10,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":30},{"Name":"Education","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":24},{"Name":"Education","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050628092408","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050628092408","DocDate":"24-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122074321","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122074321","DocURL":"21-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122074622","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122074622","DocURL":"21-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122074622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122074622","DocDate":"21-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122074321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122074321","DocDate":"21-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019150117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019150117","DocDate":"15-MAY-1996"}],"countryname":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana"}},"facets":{}}
