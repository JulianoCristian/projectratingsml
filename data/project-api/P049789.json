Within a broader assistance program, the Private Sector Development Credit will support the development of private enterprise and financial sectors, and will complement technical assistance for commercial banks, also provided by other international agencies. The project components provide for a line of credit to support the Borrower's efforts in the promotion of private sector development. Secondly, technical assistance to strengthen the institutional capacity of the banking system will be provided to the Bank of Mongolia (BOM), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the Counterpart Working Group (CWG). Participating financial intermediaries will also benefit through technical assistance for capacity building. Direct benefits will derive from the creation of a market for medium and long-term loans for private sector enterprises, which will allow the transfer of financial resources for sound economic initiatives."},"country_namecode":"Mongolia!$!MN","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":83},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MN","sectorcode":"BC,FA,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,40,43","mjthemecode":"4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":83},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050303091825","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050303091825","DocDate":"23-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050414170915","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050414170915","DocDate":"18-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9905260240313","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9905260240313","DocDate":"03-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9904300532274","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9904300532274","DocDate":"30-NOV-1998"}],"countryname":"Mongolia"}},"facets":{}}
