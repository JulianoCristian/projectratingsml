This development vision is concretized in the program supported by the DPL series in three pillars: (i) improving the investment climate to sustain growth, (ii) creating fiscal space for growth through strengthened public finances and public sector reforms; and (iii) improving service delivery and social inclusion. DPL-II builds on the achievements o f DPL-I. The first loan in the series supported important measures to liberalize trade, reduce tax distortions, create a telecommunications regulator, and reorganize and streamline public sector finances under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance among others. DPL-I envisaged an ambitious agenda of further reforms laid out over a 2-3 year period. DPL-II supports the completion of around two thirds of the envisaged measures as well as the achievement (in several areas over-achievement) of the associated medium-term outcome indicators."},"country_namecode":"Ukraine!$!UA","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":37},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":19},"sector4":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"300,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"},{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"UA","sectorcode":"ES,CT,LA,YZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,34,27,38,65","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,4,2,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"},{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":37},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":30},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":19},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":7},{"Name":"Education","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2008052210424621","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2008052210424621","DocURL":"02-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2008052210424621","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2008052210424621","DocDate":"02-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000020953_20071205105449","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20071205105449","DocDate":"20-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20070313121410","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20070313121410","DocDate":"23-FEB-2007"}],"countryname":"Ukraine","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
