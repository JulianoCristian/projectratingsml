This project comprises a component for the Municipality of Budapest and one for the Municipality of Dunaujvaros. The first-named component expands and upgrades two wastewater treatment plants and constructs a trunk main system in an unsewered area of Budapest. One of the wastewater treatment plants upgrades will include added nitrogen and phosphorous removal and biogas recovery. Upon project completion it will meet European Union effluent standards for sensitive waters. The technical assistance provided will carry out a study of industrial tariffs, solve an odor problem, and prepare a study on the regulation of industrial wastes and the enforcement of standards. The second component comprises a new primary and secondary WWTP with sludge stabilization and biogas recovery designed to meet EU standards. Stormwater overflow facilities in the collection system and pumping station upgrading. Technical assistance is included to study alternatives for operating completed facilities and the feasibility of using sludge to reclaim slag deposits."},"country_namecode":"Hungary!$!HU","sector1":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":69},"sector2":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":1},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"31,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Flood protection"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"HU","sectorcode":"BH,WD,WS,WA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,71,82","mjthemecode":"11,9,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":69},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":29},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":1},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090702000346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090702000346","DocDate":"20-MAY-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000012009_20060410085531","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060410085531","DocDate":"07-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042011273441","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042011273441","DocDate":"22-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042011293842","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042011293842","DocDate":"22-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040511373844","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040511373844","DocDate":"22-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99091002405740","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99091002405740","DocDate":"18-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229181853","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229181853","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Hungary"}},"facets":{}}
