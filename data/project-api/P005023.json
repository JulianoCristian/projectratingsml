The gas would be used to supply a gas distribution network in four districts of Cairo: Helwan, Maadi, Nasr City and Heliopolis and to provide fuel to two gas turbine plants. Specifically, the project would comprise: (i) construction of a high-pressure pipeline, (ii) an odorizing unit and four pressure-reduction stations, (iii) a distribution network of medium-density polyethylene pipes and related connection services, (iv) external and internal installation of pipes in households and related services as well as conversion of existing LPG appliances to natural gas, (v) supervisory control and cathodic protection for the gas pipelines, and (iv) technical assistance, training and project related studies."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"GS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","code":"GS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e041cf_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e041cf_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e041cd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e041cd_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190235209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190235209","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912481841","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912481841","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
