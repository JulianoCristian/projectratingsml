Specifically, the project aims to: a) strengthen faculty teaching capabilities; b) upgrade the existing science and engineering program content and broaden the range of programs relevant to Thailand's technological advancement; c) modernize laboratories and strengthen their management; and d) improve resource utilization in engineering and science faculties and establish a system for large-scale equipment procurement.  The project will support quality improvement in public universities through financing an institutional development program which will include: a) short term overseas training for selected academic and technical support staff in the educational use and maintenance of the project-financed equipment; and b) technical assistance and academic support services which will provide consultant services to evaluate existing programs and recommend new ones, improve the program resource management, develop effective procedures for large scale equipment procurement and strengthen project management.  This component will also include small-scale research projects financing for academic and technical staff selected for overseas training.  Teaching equipment will be financed for undergraduate programs together with installation costs.  Incremental expenditure on equipment related operation  and maintenance, consumable material, and project management support will also be included in the project."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"143,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"66","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040625152102","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040625152102","DocDate":"08-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172136","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172136","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123134522","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123134522","DocURL":"29-JUL-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970619110730","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970619110730","DocDate":"07-FEB-1997"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
