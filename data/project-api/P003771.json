Settlement costs will be repaid during a five-year period from proceeds of rubber sales. Under the estate development component of the project about 20,500 ha of rubber will be newly planted, replanted, or rehabilitated; 4,200 ha of coconuts and 5,000 ha of oil palm will be planted; and necessary palm oil and rubber processing facilities will be constructed. Benefits to smallholders have been estimated on the basis of increased annual incomes from about $250 currently to $800 after year 10 (constant 1976 $). Increased estate production will generate foreign exchange earnings and higher tax dividend transfers to the Government."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"65,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b0822b8b34_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0822b8b34_1_0","DocDate":"07-SEP-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b0822b8b08_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0822b8b08_1_0","DocDate":"11-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902283718","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902283718","DocDate":"31-OCT-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101911510765","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101911510765","DocDate":"31-OCT-1977"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
