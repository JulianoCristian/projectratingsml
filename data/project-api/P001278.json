It would also assist in meeting the training needs of skilled workers in industries, and in the identification of the needs for business education in Kenya and possible development of programs to meet such needs. No major risks are envisaged. However, certain lessons learned from past experience are addressed in the proposed project. The project design is expected to help avoid a shortage of qualified teaching staff for the project institutions (through inclusion in the project of necessary specialist services and fellowships), minimize implementation delays (through strengthening the Project Implementation Unit, PIU), and ensure appropriate coordination between the PIU and the ministries involved in the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"EY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other education","code":"EY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925061707","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925061707","DocDate":"23-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0455b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0455b_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902365493","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902365493","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912514817","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912514817","DocDate":"28-FEB-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya"}},"facets":{}}
