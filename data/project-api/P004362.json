The project consists of: (a) strengthening local planning and administrative capacity by financing in-service training programs for senior educational administrators and planners; (b) assisting in preparation of provincial educational plans; (c) improving primary teaching materials, including textbooks; (d) improving and college to help train teaching staff in the use of media, including textbooks; and (e) assisting provinces to extend access to and improve quality of primary education through financing provincial education programs. Gross enrollment ratios are expected to increase from 58% to 68% by the end of the project. Two thirds of this enrollment increase would be females. Some 150,000 children would receive improved textbooks and other instructional materials and about 430 poorly qualified teachers and headmasters would be trained annually. Increased class size would improve the efficiency of the system and the dropout rate is expected to fall from 30% to about 25%."},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine!$!PG","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"18,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PG","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925052417","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925052417","DocDate":"30-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925052332","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925052332","DocDate":"21-AUG-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0452a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0452a_1_0","DocDate":"23-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e975c7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975c7_1_0","DocDate":"23-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902363243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902363243","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912503591","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912503591","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"}],"countryname":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine"}},"facets":{}}
