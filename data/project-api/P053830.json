The changes will be to: (1) strengthen the new critical functions of the Federal Forestry Agency in the areas of policy development, national forest inventory/monitoring, and staff training (Part A of the project); (2) provide US$l0.0 million of additional Government co-financing for these new activities; (3) open a second special account and consolidate implementation responsibilities for Part B of the project inside Roseximbank (agent bank); and (4) extend the project until November 2009. The primary reason for these changes is to help the Russian Federation upgrade its capacity for new public forest management responsibilities, as defined by the ongoing forest sector reform and mandated by the new forest code. The secondary reason is to help the Russian Federation streamline implementation arrangements for the currently lagging Part B of the project."},"country_namecode":"Russian Federation!$!RU","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"RU","sectorcode":"YB,AT,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,39,86,82,49","mjthemecode":"5,11,11,4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":90},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":8},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20120111025138","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120111025138","DocDate":"14-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000334955_20090622080545","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090622080545","DocDate":"12-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00051005302081","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051005302081","DocDate":"14-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929102033","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929102033","DocDate":"17-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00090905311244","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00090905311244","DocDate":"31-MAY-1999"}],"countryname":"Russian Federation"}},"facets":{}}
