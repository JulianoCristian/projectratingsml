The project comprises four main components: (i) policy analysis and management which will primarily assist the Ministry of Health (MOH) in building up a capacity for policy analysis and evaluation and will finance a limited number of key studies such as a burden of disease analysis and cost-effectiveness studies; (ii) primary health care which will improve the quality and scope of primary health care in selected municipalities; (iii) emergency medical services which will support ongoing efforts by MOH to restructure emergency medical services and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery; and (iv) blood transfusion which will assist current efforts to improve the supply and quality of blood and blood products by restructuring and rehabilitating the network of blood transfusion centers by introducing safer and more up to date technology and by actively promoting the recruitment of new donors."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"26,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BG","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Public sector governance","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"89,67,25,69,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,2,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02080104011561","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02080104011561","DocDate":"06-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200231753","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200231753","DocURL":"09-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200231753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200231753","DocDate":"09-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200231954","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200231954","DocURL":"09-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961008011358","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008011358","DocDate":"15-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019100302","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019100302","DocDate":"15-MAR-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Bulgaria"}},"facets":{}}
