First, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process is sound with a strategy that is appropriate in terms of both growth and poverty reduction impact, grounded in the MDGs, backed by strong country-ownership, and a credible implementation process. Second, the budget process is credible, with continuous efforts underway to improve the predictability of resource flows to sub-national levels responsible for primary service delivery and reduce the reporting lags on actual expenditures. Third, although decentralization has placed strains on the public financial management system, fiduciary performance is acceptable and measures are being implemented to address identified weaknesses. Fourth, the Bank and other partners have supported a strong analytical program in Ethiopia involving several Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs), a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), Risk and Vulnerability Assessment, poverty analyses, diagnostics in various sectors, etc. which identified key development constraints which are at the heart of the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program's (SDPRP's) reform program."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":16},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme5":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"130,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"EZ,JA,JB,YZ,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social protection and risk management","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Human development"],"themecode":"65,27,40,54,83","mjthemecode":"11,6,4,2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20080623033316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080623033316","DocDate":"21-APR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070918101215","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070918101215","DocDate":"21-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010030111144932","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111144932","DocURL":"17-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010030111144932","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111144932","DocDate":"17-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000090341_20041108095231","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041108095231","DocDate":"01-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20041203135406","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20041203135406","DocDate":"15-SEP-2004"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
