There are four project components. 1) Community based nutrition and food security will test a community-based strategy to strengthen the capacity of communities to achieve, on a sustainable basis, good nutrition, and food security, especially for children under five and pregnant and lactating mothers. 2) Interventions to assist street children will provide grants to nongovernmental organizations already working on street children issues to improve and expand their existing activities. 3) Poverty measurement and monitoring will support three districts to pilot poverty measurement and monitoring systems, aimed at monitoring household/individual as well as community level poverty. 4) Project management will establish various units for project implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":72},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":24},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"BC,BH,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"57,53,54,51,68","mjthemecode":"8,6,6,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":72},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":24},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060612102208","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060612102208","DocDate":"17-MAY-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123550433","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123550433","DocURL":"27-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123550433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123550433","DocDate":"27-JUL-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9906030854521","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9906030854521","DocDate":"14-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911071790","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911071790","DocDate":"13-JAN-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
