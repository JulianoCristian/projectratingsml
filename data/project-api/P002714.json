It will increase Tanzania's foreign exchange earnings and contribute to raising producers income. The project will finance the construction and equipping of three factories with a total processing capacity of 30,000 tons of raw nuts, the expansion of cashewnut shell liquid storage facilities, the construction of staff accommodations and water and power supply facilities. It will also finance a cashewnut research program, an occupational health hazards study, and the provision of technical assistance for CATA. The project faces commercial risks, typical of undertakings of this nature, given the uncertainty of future raw cashewnut and cashewnut kernels export prices. However, it is considered unlikely that cashewnut kernels prices will fall below a level which will reduce the economic rate of return to an unacceptable level."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"27,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924195331","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924195331","DocDate":"28-DEC-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924195158","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924195158","DocDate":"08-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902304979","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902304979","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228bc1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228bc1_1_0","DocDate":"16-MAY-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912374970","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912374970","DocDate":"30-APR-1978"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
