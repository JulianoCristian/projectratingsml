Frequent turnover of personnel in project management impeded implementation of some activities planned for the extension phase. Activities not completed included a number of training programs, accreditation of two district hospitals, a social accountability pilot, development of a medical equipment repair and maintenance system, establishment of a drug logistics and supply chain management system, institutionalization of a special purpose fund for major infrastructure maintenance and repair in the health sector for district level hospitals and below, and pilot private sector contracting for service delivery. The state government and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) have ensured support for a number of these planned activities, including initiating citizens' report cards as a social accountability mechanism, supporting drug logistics and supply chain management, and establishing a medical equipment repair and maintenance system through the newly-established Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation Limited. Due to partial completion of the planned activities during the extension phase, a portion of the credit will not be spent during the remaining project implementation period. Consequently, International Development Association (IDA) has received a request from the Government of Rajasthan through the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, and Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) requesting cancellation of US$ 11 million."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social
