There are five main project components besides project management. Component 1 improves operations at pilot sites by assisting in preparing automated procedures to collect management data in order to monitor performance indicators, establishing programs to implement new border processing procedures and practices, and providing technical assistance and training; re-engineers procedures by providing technical assistance to MDC to improve control over goods in transit (reinforcing the border, automating data exchange between customs locations, integrating trade and transit data, and interagency coordination), streamlining declaration and transit procedures, and strengthening valuation and post-release activities. Component 2 installs and implements an ASYCUDA (Automated System for Customs Data) clearance system and supports technical assistance and training, finances training equipment, and computerizes the Moldovan Department of Customs. Component 3 implements a transit and inland control system through mobile intervention squads. Component 4 improves border crossing facilities including procurement of small equipment, supporting minor repairs, and setting up secondary inspection areas. Component 5 facilitated trade by strengthening the private-public partnership and improving performance of trade facilitation agents."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"7,210,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MD","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Trade and integration","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"28,47,49","mjthemecode":"5,5,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20110318025419","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20110318025419","DocDate":"25-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080307015619","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080307015619","DocDate":"29-OCT-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201354051","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201354051","DocURL":"13-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201354152","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201354152","DocURL":"13-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20030521142044","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030521142044","DocDate":"14-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02081304103711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02081304103711","DocDate":"12-AUG-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01092804325048","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01092804325048","DocDate":"21-MAY-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Moldova"}},"facets":{}}
