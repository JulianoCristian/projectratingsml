Component 2 empowers the MAFWM administration and management. This component establishes an organized, cohesive, and well-informed MAFWM management and administration team. Component 3 ensures safe food and sanitary and phytosanitary (free from harmful pests and plant diseases) conditions. This component supports the development of the Croatia Food Agency and creates the necessary conditions for Croatian compliance with EU sanitary and phytosanitary requirements. Component 4 finances project management, including refinancing the Project Preparation Facility, which assists In preparing the Project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
