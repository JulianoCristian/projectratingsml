The project would also enable the connection of about 75,000 further households in this area and expand the supply of electricity to rural centers. Another important objective of the project would be to permit the substitution of relatively inexpensive hydrobased power for costly and unreliable electricity from small diesel plants. The project consists of: (a) the addition of a 213 MW hydroelectric generating plant, Guadalupe IV; (b) the construction of 150 km of transmission lines; (c) the expansion of 5-6 existing substations; (d) the construction of 4-5 new ones; and (e) the rehabilitation and expansion of EPM's electricity distribution network; the project also includes construction of a regional energy control center which would enable EPM to participate in the least-cost operation of the national power system. Finally, through a training program for highly specialized staff, EPM's technical capability would be strengthened. Tariff measures provided for under the project would support the Government's objective of sound sector financing and economic structure of tariffs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"125,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e961ee_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961ee_1_0","DocDate":"10-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e961ed_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961ed_1_0","DocDate":"10-JUN-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902350992","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902350992","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912494511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912494511","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
