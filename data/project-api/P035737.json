The components are three: 1) to develop and implement a national rural roads and transport strategy; 2) to implement a pilot rural roads component using innovative institutional arrangements for maintenance and rehabilitation including the testing of new technologies for cost-effective strengthening of rural road surfaces, and pilot a new institutional framework for road management and financing; and 3) to continue support, through consultant services and providing equipment, for rehabilitating the main and secondary road network."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guatemala!$!GT","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de Caminos Rurales y Carreteras Principales</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":77},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":23},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"66,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GT","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,58,44","mjthemecode":"4,7,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":77},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":23}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080829014137","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080829014137","DocDate":"21-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200345940","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200345940","DocURL":"11-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980203115324","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980203115324","DocDate":"18-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172508","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172508","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000160016_20040422180743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040422180743","DocDate":"08-APR-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guatemala"}},"facets":{}}
