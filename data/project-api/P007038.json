These improvements are expected to result in an increase in total cattle numbers and herd productivity. It is expected that about 240 beef cattle farms would participate in the project. Technical assistance to farmers would be provided by qualified livestock technicians under the supervision of the Project Director. This group would also be responsible for assisting farmers to prepare farm development plans, for recommending these to the participating banks as basis for lending, and for supervising the execution of the work for which loans are made."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"4,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67dc6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67dc6_1_0","DocDate":"19-JUN-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902594825","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902594825","DocDate":"30-APR-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903491076","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903491076","DocDate":"30-APR-1967"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
