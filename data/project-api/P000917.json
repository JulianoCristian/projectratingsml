The project's objectives are to:  (a) assist in strengthening the institutional capacity of the Non-Formal Education Division (NFED) to manage effectively the entire literacy program; (b) ensure that all program aspects are subject to frequent evaluation and monitoring, and that research and evaluation become key inputs in the development of any new initiatives; (c) improve the existing literacy program so that a large proportion of the 840,000 adults who will be allowed to participate become fully literate; (d) ensure that all new literates, whether from the school system or from the literacy program have access to a range of reading materials in Ghanaian languages; and (e) to help expand the coverage of the FM broadcasting system to support the functional literacy program and to increase the frequency of educational broadcasting in the Ghanaian languages.  The project's main objective is to improve the quality of life of the poorest Ghanaians, especially those in the rural areas.  Credit funds will be used to finance the production of printed materials; procurement of radios, bicycles, and sewing machines as incentives for facilitators and supervisors; procurement of development inputs, vehicles and office furniture and equipment; staff training and technical assistance; and the construction of office and storage facilities."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":53},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":36},"sector3":{"Name":"Media","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"17,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Media"}],"docty":"Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"CB,BC,EL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"65,61,53","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Media","code":"CB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":53},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":36},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173644","DocDate":"22-JUL-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121085163","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121085163","DocURL":"22-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121085264","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121085264","DocDate":"22-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121084862","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121084862","DocURL":"22-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121085163","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121085163","DocDate":"22-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121084862","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121084862","DocDate":"22-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e394a6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e394a6_1_0","DocDate":"26-MAR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002090809","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002090809","DocDate":"28-FEB-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
