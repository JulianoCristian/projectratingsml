The project has six main components: 1) The policy and regulatory institutional strengthening component reviews and develops mineral policy , strategy, and regulation in order to promote exploration, and finances small-scale mining, offshore mining, mine safety and health, and mine closure. The second component develops departmental capacity to monitor and execute technical audits and mining activities by preparing monitoring and auditing strategies; implementing new institutional arrangements including organizing, staffing, and work methodology; and providing training. The third component strengthens the DoM's mineral tenements management by conducting field assessments, and developing a database. The fourth component develops project coordination and environmental assessment capacity for sustainable development in mining project areas. The fifth and sixth components fund institutional strengthening for the geological survey and develop geological information system capabilities; and implement new institutional arrangements for the IRC as well as upgrade equipment."},"country_namecode":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine!$!PG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PG","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,84","mjthemecode":"11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070821101552","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070821101552","DocDate":"20-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201532808","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201532808","DocURL":"16-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00052305315281","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00052305315281","DocDate":"05-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99111305442939","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99111305442939","DocDate":"01-MAR-2000"}],"countryname":"The Independent State of Papua New Guine"}},"facets":{}}
