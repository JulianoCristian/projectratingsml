Its specific objectives are to strengthen the monitoring and enforcement capabilities of the environmental institutions and establish technical and financial mechanisms for supporting pollution abatement investments in Greater Cairo, Alexandria, and the Suez Canal cities of Suez and Ismailia. The project has two main components: 1) The Technical and Institutional Support component provides technical assistance, studies, training, monitoring equipment and field vehicles to support four project sub-components, namely a) strengthening the capacity of environmental affairs agency branches and Governorates Environment Management Units; b) developing pollution abatement action plans for major industrial polluters; c) reviewing and conducting environmental audit programs and training, technical assistance, and establishing a database on cost effectiveness; and d) promoting awareness through seminars, workshops, and media education programs; and strengthening the technical and administrative capacity of local nongovernmental organizations. 2) The Pollution Abatement Investment component funds environmental investment sub-projects in public and private enterprises to bring their effluent discharges and/or air emissions in compliance with environmental protection laws in a cost effective manner."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government
