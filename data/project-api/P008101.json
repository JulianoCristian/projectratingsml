The proposed project would assist the Government to improve the design, delivery, and effectiveness by pursuing four objectives : a) improve the quality and relevance of education and training through curriculum development, instructor training and provision of equipment for training facilities; b) increase opportunities for youth to acquire work experience in private enterprises or public agencies; c) promote self-employment initiatives of youth; and d) strengthen the management of YTEPP Program.  Project objectives would be attained through three components : 1) \"education and training\" would assist YTEPP in improving design of its education and training courses, upgrading quality of the teaching staff, and providing supplementary instructional equipment; 2) \"post training assistance\" would support, with parallel co-financing by the private sector, work experience placements for trainees in order to facilitate their first entry into labor markets; 3) \"program management strengthening\" would strengthen management of YTEPP's training programs, establish project monitoring and evaluation systems and support a labor market information system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Trinidad and Tobago!$!TT","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":4},"sector5":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"20,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TT","sectorcode":"FE,YZ,EL,BC,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"61,51,41,65","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,4,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":33},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":4},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_99030406253996","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99030406253996","DocDate":"28-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200064503","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200064503","DocURL":"29-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200064503","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200064503","DocDate":"29-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960930134651","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930134651","DocDate":"01-MAY-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930134249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930134249","DocDate":"01-MAY-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Trinidad and Tobago","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
