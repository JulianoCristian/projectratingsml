To achieve its objective, the project will have a policy and institutional framework (PIF) and two investment components.  The PIF will: a) improve the adequacy, efficiency and equity of sub-sector funding; b) ensure that basic inputs are delivered; c) introduce systems and procedures to decentralize selected education functions and corresponding resources; d) measure the impact of project interventions on cost and learning; and e) provide a framework for handling resettlement issues.  The first investment component is capacity building at the national and regional levels which will: create a national structure for project management and capacity strengthening; build capacities in support of policy and decision making; and build capacities in support of decentralized implementation and effective schools.  The second investment component is educational improvement in 26 poor provinces.  This will: a) strengthen capacities in the divisional offices, local government units and other TEEP stakeholders; and b) develop and implement Divisional Elementary Education Development Plans which will improve learning, raise completion rates and expand access."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":66},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":17},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":7},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"113,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"JB,BC,BH,ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Rural development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,57,26,78,65","mjthemecode":"8,10,2,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":66},{"Name":"Education","Percent":17},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070504144634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070504144634","DocDate":"31-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183747","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183747","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123124486","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123124486","DocURL":"20-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123123984","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123123984","DocURL":"20-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123124185","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123124185","DocURL":"20-DEC-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970128122328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970128122328","DocDate":"25-OCT-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
