This restructuring paper aims to reallocate the trust fund proceeds to facilitate project implementation. Indicators in the results framework will be revised to include the sector core indicators to better reflect project outcomes without any changes to the project development objective. A letter establishing a grace period after closing will be prepared as part of this restructuring package. The current set of indicators focuses solely on infrastructure built rather than benefits of this infrastructure on water users, and does not contain sector core indicators."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Iraq!$!IQ","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":58},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation
