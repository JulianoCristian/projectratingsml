The changes include:  (i) a reduction in the scope of the project components; (ii) a reallocation of the project grant proceeds; and (iii) an extension of the project closing date from June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2012.  The main reasons for the changes are to: (i) address a financing gap caused by a suspension of disbursements by the project's main co-financier, the French Global Environment Facility (GEF) (FFEM - Fonds Francais pour l'Environnement Mondial); and (ii) need to increase water availability to the elephant population during extreme droughts through the deepening of existing ponds."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
