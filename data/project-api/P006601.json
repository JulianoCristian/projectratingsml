The project consists of a variety of items including: (i) improvements in ENDESA's transmission and distribution network to correct overloads and to meet expected growth in demand; (ii) the purchase of equipment (a) to maintain ENDESA's facilities and do specialized construction work; (b) to carry out studies aimed at identifying and preparing future projects; and (c) to place out-moded or worn out equipment at ENDESA's general offices; (iii) installation of a modern load dispatching/telecommunications system which would enable ENDESA to operate more efficiently the CIS and to respond quickly to problem situations which occur; (iv) spare parts to keep up existing hydro and thermal plants; (v) installation of new generating equipment or the conversion of existing units to enable them to burn cheaper fuels. This is needed to overcome inefficient operating conditions in isolated areas; and (vi) consulting services to help prepare future projects."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902272272","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902272272","DocDate":"31-DEC-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7bd43_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7bd43_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e7bd42_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7bd42_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1976"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile"}},"facets":{}}
