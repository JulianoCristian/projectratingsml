Specifically, the project will fund: 1) medium- and long-term credit to private farmers and investors to finance a wide range of investments including irrigation development with water conservation measures, livestock and forage development, tree crop plantation, forestry development, farm equipment, storage facilities, greenhouses, agro-processing plants, coastal fisheries, rural housing, and rural non-farm investments; and 2) project-related training, consulting services for the strengthening of BNA management, planning, computerization, rural outreach, and internal controls. A mid-term review will assess progress made during implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry
