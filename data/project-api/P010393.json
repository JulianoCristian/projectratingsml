The ultimate objective of the project is to slow the spread of HIV in India in order to further reduce morbidity, mortality and the impact of AIDS. The project will have a multi-pronged strategy and will consist of the following components : a) promoting public awareness and community support with a primary focus on sexual transmission, behavioral change and condom promotion through mass media communications nationally and through NGOs to reach risk behavior groups in 12 states and union territories; b) improving blood safety from a current 30 percent to 90 percent of the blood supply, and enhancing the rational use of blood and the share of voluntary donations; c) building surveillance and clinical management capacity to monitor the spread of the epidemic and to strengthen the skills of health staff and social workers in managing and counseling HIV/AIDS persons; d) controlling sexually transmitted diseases by improving clinical services and case management and training private practitioners in metropolitan areas; and e) strengthening the management capacity for HIV/AIDS control through the formation and support of organizational structures at the national and state level."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"84,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"67,57,88","mjthemecode":"8,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000094946_03082104011041","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03082104011041","DocDate":"02-JUL-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00040805510483","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00040805510483","DocDate":"21-MAR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123294605","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123294605","DocURL":"24-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123294404","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123294404","DocDate":"24-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123294605","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123294605","DocDate":"24-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123294404","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123294404","DocURL":"24-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e394aa_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e394aa_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002082202","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002082202","DocDate":"09-MAR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002082438","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002082438","DocDate":"09-MAR-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
