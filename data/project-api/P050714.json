There are three components in this project.  First, expansion of access includes construction of classrooms for the 9th grade of the new EGB3 (third cycle of basic education, from 7th to 9th grade), rehabilitation of EGB (basic education) schools, and construction of school bathrooms in the EGB schools.  Second, quality and relevance improvement will cover institutional strengthening at the school level; restructuring technical schools through the provision of up-to-date educational resources and in-service teacher training; and establishment of school-based extracurricular programs for youth.  Third, project administration will expand the Project Implementation Unit (UEP), which is responsible for the compliance with Bank's financial monitoring and auditing requirements."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":53},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":44},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary
