The project will be carried out by one or more consultants and will consit of the following components: a) review and update existing studies by Boru Hatlari ile Petro Tasima A.S. (BOTAS) on the various pipeline routes; b) preliminary design, route survey, implementation plan; c) economic and financial analysis on various throughput assumptions to be agreed with BOTAS; d) commercial structure and development of Tariff models; and e) an environmental audit."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Technical Annex","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"LC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,44,82","mjthemecode":"11,4,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00071906244467","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00071906244467","DocDate":"12-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200272123","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200272123","DocURL":"29-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3961214162128","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214162128","DocDate":"19-AUG-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
