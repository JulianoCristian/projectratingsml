The project intends to finance investment costs related to:  (a) expansion in the number of village cooperative societies involved; (b) expansion in dairy processing and marketing infrastructure to handle a further 5.2 million mlpd of milk; and (c) development of productivity enhancement measures.  In addition, the project further aims to finance investments in (d) institution strengthening measures.  By completion the project will have increased the number of participating families from 4.7 million to 6.7 million and will have substantial impact on incomes and employment for rural poverty groups and women.  Also, supply of Operation Flood milk will increase by 60 percent helping to meet a rapidly growing urban consumption."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":33},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":42},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":6},"sector4":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"360,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Impact Evaluation Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"JB,AJ,BC,YB,YA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"77,78,75","mjthemecode":"10,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":33},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":42},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":12},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Impact Evaluation Report (IER),  Vol.1","DocType":"IER","EntityID":"000009265_3971104184732","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971104184732","DocDate":"30-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625093704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625093704","DocDate":"14-JAN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926102330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926102330","DocDate":"18-NOV-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
