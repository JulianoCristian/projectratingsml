It aims at improving the living conditions of low-income people in the Amman region by providing shelter at affordable prices without subsidy to ensure the project's replicability; encouraging sound growth patterns through stimulating urban development in appropriate locations and at lower infrastructure cost than under traditional practice; and strengthening institutional capacities in Jordan to undertake low-income shelter and urbanization projects. The project includes the following major components: (a) upgrading two low-income squatter settlements that house about 4,200 people; (b) servicing land in four sites for about 3,400 plots with initial occupancy by about 24,00 people; and (c) providing technical assistance to the UDD for project design, project planning and supervision, studies and advice on management and financial issues."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"28,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban housing"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"JO","sectorcode":"UH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban Development","code":"UX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban housing","code":"UH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007011943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007011943","DocDate":"29-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094923","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"}],"countryname":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan"}},"facets":{}}
