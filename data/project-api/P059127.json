There are three project components. 1) Technology development and adaptation will finance: adaptive research and development activities to address specific production constraints and opportunities; new priorities to respond to serious emerging problems identified in subsequent annual assessment; and establishment of an Agricultural Research and Development Fund to support a competitive research grants scheme. 2) Outreach, extension, and technology dissemination will give priority to the development and transfer of technology that address actual constraints of the dominant production systems of Uganda. It will also support demand-driven, client-oriented research and promote active participation of stakeholders in research planning, implementation, and beneficiary impact assessment. 3) Institutional development will support the transformation of National Agriculture Research Organization into a research and development institution and strengthen its capacity to monitor, evaluate, and determine economic impact of improved technologies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":40},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"26,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Procurement Plan,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"AB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"48,57,86,79","mjthemecode":"10,11,7,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":60},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":40}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333038_20080813000917","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080813000917","DocDate":"12-AUG-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031011241356","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031011241356","DocDate":"02-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050416234357","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050416234357","DocDate":"02-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9904210531462","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9904210531462","DocDate":"09-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_9908190532001","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9908190532001","DocDate":"31-MAR-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
