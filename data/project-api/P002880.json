Firstly, to relieve the immediate constraints on investments caused by the present lack of properly prepared projects; and, secondly, over the project period, to create the institutional capacity for identifying investment proposals and processing these through feasibility studies, obtaining financing and establishing final project execution plans. The project will achieve these objectives through the following components: (i) an investment preparation component in the form of feasibility studies and detailed execution plans of projects included in the Government's triennial Public Investment Program; and (ii) a sectoral priorities component in the form of studies and training to supplement present knowledge of sectoral investment priorities. The studies are to be carried out under, or such training to be provided to, the planning units of the relevent technical ministries."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Togo!$!TG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TG","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance"],"themecode":"30","mjthemecode":"2,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07fde_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07fde_1_0","DocDate":"18-MAY-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927172931","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927172931","DocDate":"20-APR-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927172830","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927172830","DocDate":"20-APR-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Togo"}},"facets":{}}
