The project components include: 1) The community subproject component will finance rural community associations to support priority, small-scale investments identified by community groups. It comprises the State Community Scheme, Municipal Community Schemes, and Pilot Municipal Community Funds. 2) The institutional development component will finance mobilization assistance for participating communities, capacity building for Community Associations and Municipal Councils, and other technical assistance and training. 3) The administration monitoring and evaluation component will support overall project coordination and supervision."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de
