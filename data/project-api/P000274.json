The main objectives of the project will be to strengthen national agricultural research planning and implementation capacity while ensuring that research be responsive to farmers' needs. Linkages between research and extension will also be strengthened. The Agricultural Research Project will seek to achieve those objectives by funding improvements in research facilities, technical assistance and training, and equipment, vehicles and operating costs associated with the implementation of agreed priority research programs. The Agricultural Research Project will contribute to the development of the Institut d'Etudes et de Recherches Agricoles (INERA) and The Institut de Recherche en Biologie et Ecologie Tropicale (IRBET) research management capacity. Joint planning will be expected to lead to more efficient use of scarce human and financial resources and thereby increase the impact of other investments in the agricultural and rural sectors."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"17,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BF","sectorcode":"AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83,78","mjthemecode":"10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120363728","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120363728","DocURL":"23-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120363227","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120363227","DocDate":"23-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120363227","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120363227","DocURL":"23-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120363728","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120363728","DocDate":"23-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120364029","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120364029","DocURL":"23-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120364029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120364029","DocDate":"23-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07ee5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07ee5_1_0","DocDate":"19-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926065201","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926065201","DocDate":"15-MAR-1988"}],"countryname":"Burkina Faso"}},"facets":{}}
