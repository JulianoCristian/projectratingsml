The Project supports the Government of Panama's poverty alleviation strategy as it (a) targets nutrition interventions in the poorest districts; (b) contributes to human resource development by improving access to basic and preventive health services; (c) involves the community in the design and execution of subprojects and makes them fully responsible for their operation and maintenance; and (d) makes the fullest use of nongovernmental organizations, private sector and community resources. Thus, the project consists of three components: nutrition, rural water supply and sanitation, and institutional strengthening."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
