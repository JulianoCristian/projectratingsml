Therefore, the project will: a) strengthen efforts to increase the National Social Security Insitute's (NSSI) overall operational efficiency in the emerging market economy, focusing on reversing the reduced tax compliance trend which is undermining the financial stability of the public Pay-As-You-Go social insurance program; and b) strengthening the NSSI to perform key policy formulation and evaluation functions and better manage available resources. The first component is increasing compliance and operational efficiency. This will institute effective operational procedures for inter alia: a) control and monitoring of fund flow into and out of the social insurance system; b) improved revenue/ expenditure projection and benefit calculation on an actual contribution basis; and c) improved services to clients, including efficient payment of pensions and short term benefits. The second major component is strengthening Institutional capacity by: a) policy analysis; b) actuarial forecasting; c) public information/ education concerning the social insurance program and d) personnel management including improvements in staff selection, incentives, training and career development. The project will be implemented over a period of four years."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":67},"theme2":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"24,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"BG","sectorcode":"BE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"28,87","mjthemecode":"6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03021304100966","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03021304100966","DocDate":"19-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214132711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214132711","DocDate":"30-JUL-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062812075019","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062812075019","DocDate":"09-JUN-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Bulgaria"}},"facets":{}}
