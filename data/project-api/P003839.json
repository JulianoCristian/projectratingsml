The project includes: (a) a pilot project to promote sustainable upland farming systems covering 23,000 ha in eight districts of the Jratunseluna River Basin in Central Java and the Brantas River Basin in East Java. It involves; (b) farming systems research for areas of critically eroded lands, the results of which will be tested on 72 demonstration plots; and (c) about 475 km of access roads. Further, the project provides for; (d) human resource development, under which training will be provided to farmers and community leaders, agricultural extension agents, and to planning, management and administrative staff at the provincial and district levels. Finally, the project includes; (e) institutional development, under which long-term specialists will be recruited to provide support and training at various levels; and (f) a US$500,000 project innovation fund, which will finance proposals from nongovernment institutions and special government-funded activities that address issues of upland productivity and/or resource conservation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019123159","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019123159","DocDate":"29-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904162713","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904162713","DocDate":"31-JUL-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
