It would also improve water supply to 3 million people who now receive deficient service in the same states. The project woud include extensions and improvements of the water supply systems in the capital cities of Parana (Curitiba) and Santa Catarina (Florianopolis); extension and improvement of the sewerage system in Curitiba; construction of a sewerage system for Florianopolis; construction or expansion and improvements of water supply systems in 125 medium-sized cities and 210 small communities; and construction or improvement of sewerage systems in 33 medium-sized cities. The project would also include production metering programs and installation of consumption meters, preparation of water supply master plans for Florianopolis and Curitiba, and technical assistance for the BNH and the three state water companies. It is estimated that about 54% of the final beneficiaries would belong to families having incomes below the relative poverty level. Indirect benefits in terms of water pollution control would accrue especially to the urban poor."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"130,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924225818","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924225818","DocDate":"14-JAN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902342199","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902342199","DocDate":"31-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912472042","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912472042","DocDate":"31-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96149_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96149_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e96147_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96147_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAR-1980"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
