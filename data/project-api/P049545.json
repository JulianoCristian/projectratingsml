The project will proceed in two phases and consist of two main components. The first component sets the stage for decentralization and health reform, while helping to sustain health social safety net services introduced during the economic crisis. Task forces will address institutional and health sector issues and assist in building district implementation capacity, including upgrading health information systems. Some results expected by the end of 2001 include finalization of the division of responsibilities and institutional arrangements between districts and provinces, a human resource development plan, staff training, baseline surveys and mapping of poverty areas, developing integrated health planning and budgeting systems, reviewing and piloting alternative insurance approaches, examining tax-based and other means of generating resources for health, introducing quality assurance programs, and intensifying health promotion. Grants will be made available to districts to finance implementation of the recommendations made by the task forces and to reform and improve district level health services. The second component helps the central health ministry become an effective, analytical, advisory, and advocacy agency; and provides grants to provinces and districts."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":84},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"38,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BH,BK,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,93,89,67,26","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8,8,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":84},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20131121150028","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20131121150028","DocDate":"13-NOV-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20080805063026","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080805063026","DocDate":"26-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000020439_20071126105704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20071126105704","DocDate":"01-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000011823_20071207163046","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000011823_20071207163046","DocDate":"30-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.01/01/2005","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20051005100150","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20051005100150","DocDate":"23-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201135632","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201135632","DocURL":"20-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201135632","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201135632","DocDate":"20-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_0006020538288","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0006020538288","DocDate":"10-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929173408","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929173408","DocDate":"10-APR-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
