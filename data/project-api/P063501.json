There are two primary components: 1) Public sector Y2K efforts will address the Y2K problems of many agencies which have large computerized applications that are at risk. Since many of the applications were developed in-house, the remedial efforts will similarly be done that way. Many at-risk items require the procurement of upgrades or replacements. Goods will therefore form the bulk of the intended expenditure under this component. 2) National coordination efforts will cover the coordination of contingency planning, critical services with cross dependencies, national monitoring, dissemination efforts, public information management, legal planning, etc."},"country_namecode":"Malaysia!$!MY","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Loan Agreement,Executive Director's Statement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MY","sectorcode":"BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance"],"themecode":"30","mjthemecode":"2,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000094946_02071104014989","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071104014989","DocDate":"26-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201424753","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201424753","DocURL":"31-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Executive Director's Statement (Executive Director's Statement),  Vol.1","DocType":"Executive Director's Statement","EntityID":"000016351_20140512165349","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000016351_20140512165349","DocDate":"29-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99032505564227","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99032505564227","DocDate":"16-FEB-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911061241","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911061241","DocDate":"31-OCT-1998"}],"countryname":"Malaysia"}},"facets":{}}
