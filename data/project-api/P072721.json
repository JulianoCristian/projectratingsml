The project has the following three components: Component 1) will provide the project's first operational demonstrations that the greatest energy efficiency gains and cost savings in residential space heating can be achieved through an integrated effort that simultaneously addresses the thermal integrity of buildings, the operational efficiency of heat supply systems, the provision of means for heat control by consumers, and the implementation of heat metering, cost-based heat pricing and consumption-based heat billing. Component 2) will provide the vehicle to support the critical role of the central government to provide policy direction to localities, bring the best national and international expertise to bear on issues surrounding implementation of reform and development of new technical approaches, coordinate and guide implementation of local project activities, undertake central project management and monitoring functions, and disseminate successful ideas and results outside of participating cities. Component 3) will promote simultaneous development of both heating sector reforms and building energy efficiency improvements in 4-6 additional northern Chinese municipalities, achieving broad,
