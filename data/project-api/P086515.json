The two basic components of the project includes: (1) the electrified railway line between the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou Province and the city of Zhanyi in Yunnan Province will be upgraded to increase its capacity and allow for higher operating speeds of trains, including realignment of the existing track as needed and construction of a second track throughout, to design standards that will allow operation of double-stack container trains. Persons displaced in connection with carrying out the above will be resettled. The new line will broadly follow the existing corridor but, to enable the running speed to be increased, the alignment will be straightened and the route length will be reduced; and (2) the capacity of the Ministry of Railways on railway planning, management and technology will be strengthened, through studies, technical assistance and training. Proposed studies and training include: (a) technical study on the reliability of current collection and extra-high catenary design for high-speed rail lines, (b) research and study on rail grinding methods for improving operating efficiency, and (c) training."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
