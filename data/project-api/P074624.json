The project will provide funds to cover the incremental power supply costs, attributable to the 2003 drought. Specifically, the International Development Association's (IDA) financial contribution, will cover the incremental costs of fuel for running the Ubungo Power Plant on Jet A1 fuel through July 2004, when the Plant will be commissioned to operate on indigenous gas, and, the costs due to the purchase of electricity produced from the Independent Power Tanzania Ltd. (IPTL) Power Plant, operating on heavy fuel oil, through February 2005. Given the circumstances, the project will assist in avoiding severe load-shedding, and the consequent negative impact on the overall economy, and delivery of social services. This will benefit not only electricity customers, but also those employed in the formal and informal services, who would otherwise, lose jobs and income due to the economic impact of significant power supply interruptions. Moreover, the project will help maintain the current momentum of the power sector reform program. Both severe load-shedding, and massive tariff increases (i.e., a surcharge to fully cover all additional thermal generation costs) could jeopardize the sector reform program."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"43,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Procurement Plan,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39","mjthemecode":"4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070816095555","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070816095555","DocDate":"26-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000014464_2010042015220040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010042015220040","DocDate":"05-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010022609455937","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010022609455937","DocDate":"05-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010022609455937","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010022609455937","DocURL":"05-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000012009_20040520112328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040520112328","DocDate":"14-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000112742_20041214114540","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20041214114540","DocDate":"04-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20040525165834","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040525165834","DocDate":"01-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20040525170213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040525170213","DocDate":"01-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000090341_20040419110539","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040419110539","DocDate":"31-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000090341_20040419133956","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040419133956","DocDate":"18-MAR-2004"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
