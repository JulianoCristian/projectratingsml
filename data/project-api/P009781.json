Possible risks facing the project are in the form of implementation delays, and possible management shortcomings. These risks are minimized by the use of commercially proven technologies supplied by internationally recognized engineering firms and by the use of the services of staff recruited from the team that successfully completed the Bank-financed IFFCO Phulphur project, who are experienced in building and commissioning similar plants. The risk of delay in plant commissioning if the gas pipeline to Hazira is not completed on time will be minimized by the close monitoring of the pipeline to be constructed by GOI. The possible management risk would be minimized on account of the action taken by KRIBHCO to hire the services of efficient senior managers from IFFCO to help to implement this project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"400,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"IC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","code":"IC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e0428f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0428f_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0428d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0428d_1_0","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902370823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902370823","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912485821","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912485821","DocDate":"31-MAR-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
