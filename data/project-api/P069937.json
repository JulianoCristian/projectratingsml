The extension is necessary to provide sufficient time to deliver and install the information technology (IT) equipment (US$2.1 million) and install LAN (local area network) cabling network (US$0.4 million) in the social welfare institutions throughout Croatia. Without the extension, the Government will not be able to use loan funds for completing the two remaining activities necessary for the completion of the social welfare management information system (MIS). Without Bank financing, completion of the mentioned activities will depend on ministry of health and social welfare's ability to allocate $2.5 million of own funds for this purpose, which might be difficult given the reduced investment budget of the ministry and could jeopardize the completion of the MIS."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Croatia!$!HR","sector1":{"Name":"Other social
