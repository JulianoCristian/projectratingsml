The project will consist of: (i) the establishment of a Fisheries Manpower Development Center, a self-contained training facility to meet the fisheries sector's trained manpower needs; (ii) financing of teaching equipment for the training of refrigeration technicians; and (iii) a Fisheries Village Development component consisting of the development of four existing fisheries cooperatives comprising five villages by providing integrated fish landing, handling, storage, marketing, transport and repair facilities to enable them to handle all fisheries-related activities from catch to final retail marketing. The project will also provide 156 man-months of technical assistance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"AF","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","code":"AF"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925123239","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925123239","DocDate":"16-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902401420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902401420","DocDate":"30-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228cd6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228cd6_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05b56_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05b56_1_0","DocDate":"24-JUN-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912575125","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912575125","DocDate":"31-MAY-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
