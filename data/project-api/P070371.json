To this end, the project goals focus on seven key areas: a) develop a sound national policy and institutional framework for housing, and urban development; b)design and establish a unified housing subsidy policy that facilitates access of low/moderate-income families, to housing, and leverages household savings, and private credit finance; c) strengthen the housing credit, and savings systems; d) strengthen urban real property registries, and rights; d) increase the supply of urban land and its access by the poor, and improve real estate market functions; e) coordinate and support physical and social investments, to systematically upgrade poor neighborhoods; and, f) improved prevention and management of the impacts of natural disasters. Risks however, include a relatively ambitious cross-sectoral approach, risking the timing approval of the second and third loans in the program. However, this risk should be mitigated through the well-designed, integrated strategy, and a small number of key prior actions, including the intended reform policy."},"country_namecode":"United
