Furthermore, it will demonstrate an institutional structure for the implementation of LFG projects, with private sector participation, and strengthen regulatory, and social frameworks for LFG introduction in Mexico. Project components call for: 1) funding provision for the design, and construction of a LFG collection system, and power plant at the Metropolitan Solid Waste Processing System (SIMEPRODESO) landfill. Implementation of this facility will be under a public-private partnership, which will include as well the construction of methane monitoring wells; 2) capacity building, to promote replication of the LFG collection, and facility use. Training, workshops, and information dissemination designed to build capacity of government entities, and private contractors, in the promotion, and management of LFG projects, will be funded, as will the development of a national replication strategy; 3) technical assistance (TA) to identify legal, policy, and regulatory reform necessary to LFG management; 4) appropriate regional dissemination of the LFG design, and experiences gained from the project, mainly through workshops, and, in addition, funds will be provided to develop twinning arrangements, including capacity building; and, 5) project management, supervision, and monitoring support."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","sector1":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":18},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"6,270,000","sector":[{"Name":"Renewable energy"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MX","sectorcode":"BH,BC,LE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law"],"themecode":"33,81,74,73,84","mjthemecode":"11,9,9,11,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":78},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":18},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070215145538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070215145538","DocDate":"30-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060210244594","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060210244594","DocDate":"29-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01050305445080","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01050305445080","DocDate":"15-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00112305422233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00112305422233","DocDate":"30-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99092312090320","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99092312090320","DocDate":"24-NOV-2000"}],"countryname":"United Mexican States"}},"facets":{}}
