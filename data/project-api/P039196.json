The objective of the State Reform Project is to improve efficiency in the government's service delivery through privatization and to improve the state's fiscal condition. The project is tailored to support successful implementation of RGS's more limited privatization and fiscal reforms. Its components comprise technical assistance, restructuring of public enterprises that adopt voluntary departure programs, and subprojects and programs to mitigate the reform program's costs, including priority investments and social assistance projects. Selected reforms include actions to privatize the Rio Grande do Sul telecommunications company and the state power company, and to award concessions of water and sewage services, port services, and road maintenance. The environmental targets set for the new utilities will be a critical factor determining both the economic feasibility and the environmental consequences of restructuring; thus, a consistent set of targets and obligations for the restructured utilities will have to be developed early in the process. Other components include reform-related studies, audits, and training; reform-related equipment and rehabilitation works; high priority investments in land management and rural poverty alleviation; highway, school, and hospital rehabilitation; severance pay to employees of reforming state enterprises; and transfers and non-transfers to municipalities and private institutions (to cushion the reform's impact) for incremental, recurrent expenditures in early childhood, public health, sanitation, and basic education."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":9},"sector4":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":4},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"125,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Information Document,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BH,WZ,TA,JB,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Economic management","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"34,40,21,30,43","mjthemecode":"4,2,1,4,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":50},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":35},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":9},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":4},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000090341_20030625111436","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030625111436","DocDate":"23-MAY-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183743","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200295428","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200295428","DocDate":"10-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200295428","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200295428","DocURL":"10-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200295327","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200295327","DocURL":"10-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200295327","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200295327","DocDate":"10-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625093525","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625093525","DocDate":"24-JAN-1997"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
