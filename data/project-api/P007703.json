The project will support the government's strategy of transforming the Sub Secretaria de Ecologia (SEDUE/SE) over time into a highly qualified second tier organization that supervises and coordinates environmental work carried out by other levels of government.  The project will finance the first phase of the government's environmental program concentrating on key functions of SEDSUE/SE.  The first phase will have three components.  Component I will finance key environmental services, namely monitoring and controlling water and air pollution, and conserving biodiversity.  Component II will strengthen sector management and administration, through institutional strengthening of SEDUE/SE, a pilot decentralization program with up to five states, and the commissioning of special studies.  Component III supports the strengthening of the regulatory framework through the preparation of additional technical standards of pollution control and natural resources protection.
