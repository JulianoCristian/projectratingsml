SAP is the name given to Pakistan's overall effort to improve basic social services over the five year period 1993/94-1997/98. The Social Action Program Project will reinforce existing social sector programs and projects, whether or not aid-financed, by focusing on a few core problems that impede implementation throughout the social sectors. It will help finance the first three years (1993/94-1995/96) of the Program. For planning and monitoring, the SAP is divided into constituent sub-programs. The main ones include twelve that cover three basic social services -- primary education, primary health care, and rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) -- in each of Pakistan's four provinces, plus the national population program. Others cover selected federally managed health and education programs and basic services in areas directly administered by the Federal Government. It intends to provide US$10 million to help promote community involvement and innovation in basic service delivery."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of
