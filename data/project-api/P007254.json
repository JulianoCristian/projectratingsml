The project aims to: a) improve health and nutrition over the short-term; and b) assist in the formulation of sustainable policies and programs in the social sectors over the medium term. The project contains four components: 1) institutional development; 2) sub-project implementation; 3) establishment of a living standards measurement survey (LSMS); and 4) development of a policy framework in the health sector. The first component assists in the development of the Social Impact Amelioration Program (SIMAP) Agency.  The second component addresses basic health, nutrition, water and sanitation needs of the groups affected by the economic decline, especially pregnant and lactating women and children under age five.  Financing is provided for: i) rehabilitation of primary health care facilities; ii) nutrition education and food distribution programs; iii) construction of day care centers; and iv) installation of basic water supply facilities.  The third component involves development of a household survey. The last component includes financing of technical assistance to help the government develop medium term policies for the health sectors."},"country_namecode":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana!$!GY","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"10,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GY","sectorcode":"JB,BC,WZ,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"51,54,67,68","mjthemecode":"8,8,6,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":42},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":32},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121571475","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121571475","DocDate":"07-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121571576","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121571576","DocURL":"07-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121571475","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121571475","DocURL":"07-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121571576","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121571576","DocDate":"07-AUG-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e394d2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e394d2_1_0","DocDate":"30-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e394d0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e394d0_1_0","DocDate":"30-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002042819","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002042819","DocDate":"02-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002042936","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002042936","DocDate":"02-APR-1992"}],"countryname":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana"}},"facets":{}}
