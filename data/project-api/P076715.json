There are four project components. The first component identifies areas of systematic discrimination, introduces measures prohibiting discrimination and human rights denial, promotes behavioral change, maintains people's awareness of HIV/AIDS risks and protection measures as well as safe sex practices, and launches a major schools initiative, resorts to non-traditional practices, wages mass media campaigns, and conducts special presentations. The second component supports clinical preventive interactions for reducing and controlling HIV/AIDS; clinical management of sexually transmitted diseases, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment, and blood bank and laboratories quality control. The third component upgrades current services available for providing care to PLWA, and for treatment, including introducing triple anti-retroviral therapy; and finances manuals and staff training. The fourth component funds institutional development, management, and surveillance."},"country_namecode":"Grenada!$!GD","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":48},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"6,040,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Board Report,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"GD","sectorcode":"BG,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"67,93,69,88,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,8,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":48},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100113000027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100113000027","DocDate":"23-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Board Report (BR),  Vol.1","DocType":"BR","EntityID":"000160016_20041105100646","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20041105100646","DocDate":"05-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202121416","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202121416","DocURL":"05-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202121617","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202121617","DocDate":"05-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202121416","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202121416","DocDate":"05-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202121617","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202121617","DocURL":"05-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02071304010345","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071304010345","DocDate":"01-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02060604044316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02060604044316","DocDate":"30-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02053005034222","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02053005034222","DocDate":"23-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02101805031795","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02101805031795","DocDate":"29-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061011552358","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061011552358","DocDate":"29-NOV-2001"}],"countryname":"Grenada"}},"facets":{}}
