There are four components including project coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and studies. The other three components comprise 1) risk assessment and fire monitoring, which uses appropriate technology and methods for assessing fire risk through integrating soil moisture maps, forest type maps, and human activity maps; and initiates studies and long-range planning to identify and respond to such issues as the potential for increased flammability of burned areas; 2) forest fire prevention, which develops technical assistance and educational campaigns for local communities and different stakeholders in high risk areas to provide guidance on the risks and consequences of uncontrolled burning; provides training and equipment to fire combat brigades; and conducts intensive enforcement operations and compliance to regulations to prevent and regulate illegal burning activities; and 3) forest fire suppression, which develops contingency plans to combat forest fires and refers control of major fires to a federal task force."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":54},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":23},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BH,JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"57,82,52","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,11,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":54},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":23},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":23}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050727091223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050727091223","DocDate":"28-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201411485","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201411485","DocURL":"30-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201411485","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201411485","DocDate":"30-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3981005112242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3981005112242","DocDate":"26-AUG-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903312295","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903312295","DocDate":"01-AUG-1998"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
