The project would include construction works for improving irrigation and drainage facilities. To enable farmers to cope with the tightened crop calendars and to intensify cropping pattterns, the project would also provide for a substantial increase in farm equipment for land preparation and plant protection. The agricultural supporting services would be strengthened, particularly the extension service, and supplies of farm inputs would be improved. For proper handling of the increased farm production, farm roads would be improved. Finally, the project would provide technical assistance for improving the operation and maintenance of the irrigation systems."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081df55c2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081df55c2_1_0","DocDate":"30-NOV-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902271965","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902271965","DocDate":"30-NOV-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901474626","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901474626","DocDate":"30-NOV-1976"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
