This paper pertains to a restructuring of the project. The changes under this restructuring are: 1) an extension of the closing date; 2) reallocation of funds and revision of some activities; and 3) adjustment to the results framework to be aligned with the revised activities. The extension of the loan closing date by one year is to allow for a more realistic implementation schedule and additional support for schools to implement teaching and learning activities as well as provision of learning materials, and in-service teacher training for lower secondary teachers. The reallocation of funds is due to the cancellation of construction of lower secondary schools, as a result of which funds will be reallocated from works to goods and training within the same category, as well as to another category. This reallocation of funds leads to changes in certain project activities, which necessitate modifications in the results framework."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectAbstract>Le Programme sectoriel de l\u2019\u00e9ducation (PSE), en relation avec la strat\u00e9gie de r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 et les objectifs du Mill\u00e9naire pour le d\u00e9veloppement, vise la combinaison des objectifs suivants\u00a0: 1)\u00a0soutenir le syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif pour favoriser la croissance \u00e9conomique, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme le principal moteur de la r\u00e9duction \u00e0 terme de la pauvret\u00e9\u00a0; 2)\u00a0cibler des actions pour permettre progressivement de corriger les disparit\u00e9s li\u00e9es au genre, aux zones et aux revenus et \u00e9viter l\u2019exclusion\u00a0; 3)\u00a0enfin, \u00e9laborer une strat\u00e9gie \u00e0 m\u00eame de produire du capital humain r\u00e9pondant aux demandes des secteurs informel et moderne de l\u2019\u00e9conomie pour offrir une \u00e9ducation de qualit\u00e9 \u00e0 tou(te)s les apprenant(e)s Les impacts n\u00e9gatifs de la mise en \u0153uvre du PSE pourraient \u00eatre\u00a0: le d\u00e9placement des populations et la perte d'activit\u00e9s, notamment commerciales/marchandes, artisanales et agricoles\u00a0et la perte de patrimoine (cantines, commerces, \u00e9tals)\u00a0; la perte de moyens de production (cultures)\u00a0; la perte de sources de revenus et de moyens d\u2019existence.
