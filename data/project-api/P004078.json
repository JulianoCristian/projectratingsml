It would also support the decentralized decision-making and self-help features of the Saemaeul (New Community) Movement. The project includes: the irrigation of about 9,200 ha, consisting of about 60 subprojects; the construction of water supply systems in about 7,400 villages; the construction or improvement of about 2,500 km of river banks, consisting of about 8,300 subprojects; the connection of about 2,700 villages to the telephone network and the installation of about 75,000 subscriber's lines at the subdistrict town level; and training and project monitoring and evaluation. The project would benefit about 7.7 million people or about 48% of Korea's rural population. Of these, about 500,000 (the beneficiaries of the irrigation component together with those to be served by the private telephone lines) would benefit to a larger degree than the remaining 7.2 million beneficiaries. The project faces no special risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"95,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f7b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f7b_1_0","DocDate":"07-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902295693","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902295693","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912373751","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912373751","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
