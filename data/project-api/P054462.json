There are four project components. First, institutional strengthening will support procurement of vehicles, office and field equipment and provide technical assistance and training. Second, community strengthening involves pre-and post-land purchase services. The component will support communities and establish their legal entity status, organize themselves according to their uses and practices, research legal status of prospective lands to be purchased, etc. Third, community subprojects will finance social and productive complementary infrastructure investments related to land purchased under the program. The last component, land purchases and leases, is not financed by the Bank."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guatemala!$!GT","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":54},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":13},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Personal and property rights","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"23,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GT","sectorcode":"BC,WC,YZ,TA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Rule of law","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83,33,75,58,36","mjthemecode":"3,7,10,3,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Personal and property rights","code":"36"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":54},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":13},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":13},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100722033120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100722033120","DocDate":"30-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20060328085004","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060328085004","DocDate":"21-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9903191053323","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9903191053323","DocDate":"03-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061012371829","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061012371829","DocDate":"02-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703530945","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703530945","DocDate":"30-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000012009_20040422102034","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040422102034","DocDate":"01-NOV-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guatemala"}},"facets":{}}
