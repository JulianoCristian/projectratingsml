This restructuring paper proposes the cancellation of US$5 million International Development Association (IDA) allocation to the project. The value of the project as approved by the Board is US$22.5 million, with a co-financing arrangement through a Bank-administered specially created single purpose, single-country multi-donor trust-fund (MDTF). The IDA allocation was increased from US$10 million to US$15 million during project negotiation to cover a potential short-term funding shortfall of the MDTF. The World Bank and the Government of Burundi agreed during project negotiations to cancel US$5 million IDA allocation to the project when sufficient resources would become available through the MDTF. The MDTF has currently US$12.5 million available, ensuring full financing of the value of the project of US$22.5 million. The Bank may cancel an amount of a grant when the Bank has determined, after consultation with the borrower, that the grant account contains a surplus that is not required to finance project costs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Burundi!$!BI","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict
