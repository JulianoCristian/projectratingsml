It also covers measures aimed at fostering social inclusion and better managing natural resources. And it supports governance reforms in areas such as public financial management, public administration, and legal and judicial development. These fundamental reforms provide the foundation upon which the government can then effectively implement sectoral policy actions. The potential volatility of capital inflows makes it important for Vietnam to secure resources on a long-term basis and to signal the support of the international community to its reform program. Strong capital inflows and government interventions in the exchange rate market to prevent the appreciation of the dong resulted in higher inflation, a current account deficit and an asset price bubble in 2007. Bank lending and investments of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the stock market and in real estate amplified these trends. Market sentiment might have reversed Sound macroeconomic management will be critical to sustain a strong economic performance and continued poverty reduction in this more turbulent environment. To address this risk, the current credit supports measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies. They include the assessment of SOE investments in the financial and real estate sectors, the strengthening of banking supervision and corporate governance in banks, and the adoption of criteria to prioritize public sector investments."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Financing Agreement,Project Paper,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"BK,EZ,AZ,FZ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,82,29,27,65","mjthemecode":"8,2,2,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":34},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":22},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":22},{"Name":"Education","Percent":11},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20130417110933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130417110933","DocDate":"14-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000021321_2008120916251890","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008120916251890","DocDate":"29-JUL-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2008120916251890","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008120916251890","DocURL":"29-JUL-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000334955_20080605024639","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080605024639","DocDate":"27-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20080520125455","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080520125455","DocDate":"16-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000076092_20080304161535","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080304161535","DocDate":"18-FEB-2008"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}},"facets":{}}
