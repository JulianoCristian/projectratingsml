The first is a basic health care component which will support the Ministry of Health (MOH)'s Basic Health Care Program in extending coverage of and in improving the quality of basic health care services to the poor. This component is centered around maternal and child health care interventions and includes: i) cost-effective health care teams at local health facilities; ii) upgrading of facilities; and iii) medical inputs and essential drugs on a cost-recovery basis. The second is a nutrition component containing subcomponents in information, dissemination, and non-formal education, growth monitoring, and food supplementation. Activities financed will include: educational campaigns advocating good general nutrition, feeding practices, and breastfeeding. Third, a basic sanitation and safe water component will assist MOH in improving access to safe water and sanitation facilities in rural areas. Finally, a sector policy and institutional strengthening component will support: (a) development of institutional basis for decentralization; (b) staff development; and (c) studies devoted to improved inter-institutional coordination, cost recovery and payment systems, hospital rehabilitation, and impact evaluation of project activities and other activities in the public health
