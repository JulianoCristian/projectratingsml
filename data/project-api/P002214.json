It comprises two distinct components which include the Gitarama Agricultural Production and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Forestry (MINAGRI) Institutional Development components. The first component would be the pilot phase of a national agricultural extension and agriculture service organization, and of a national program for promoting private and cooperative investment in agriculture, agro-processing and marketing. The service systems developed on a pilot basis under this component are intended as a model which would be replicable at the national level if institutionally and financially sustainable. The MINAGRI institutional development component would strengthen the institution-building process to improve agricultural sector planning and management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Rwanda!$!RW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RW","sectorcode":"AE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","code":"AE"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925233518","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925233518","DocDate":"31-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000334955_20090122063635","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090122063635","DocDate":"31-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36b05_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36b05_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAR-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094529","DocDate":"28-FEB-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165217","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165217","DocDate":"28-FEB-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Rwanda"}},"facets":{}}
