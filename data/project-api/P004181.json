This would be achieved by: (i) expansion of agricultural productive capacity; (ii) strengthening of the existing agricultural productive capacity and of the maintenance of existing support infrastructure; and (iii) improvements in relevant institutional capacity and operating procedures, particularly in procurement, inventory control, planning, budgeting, and accounting. The project would finance six subprojects, namely: small-scale irrigation; agricultural production support; agricultural road maintenance; livestock feed production; sugar processing; and warehousing and inventory management. These six subprojects would be supported by technical assistance and training. The project would directly benefit approximately 60,000 small farm families."},"country_namecode":"Lao People's Democratic Republic!$!LA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Annual crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"6,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Annual crops"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Credit Agreement","countrycode":"LA","sectorcode":"AQ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Annual crops","code":"AQ"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101128","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101128","DocDate":"30-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901033282","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901033282","DocDate":"30-JUN-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05d90_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05d90_1_0","DocDate":"28-JUN-1983"}],"countryname":"Lao People's Democratic Republic"}},"facets":{}}
