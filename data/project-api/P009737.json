The objective of this loan is to continue to utilize ICICI as an efficient channel for financing high priority industrial projects many of which are export oriented and/or are located in backward areas. The loan will also continue to encourage ICICI to undertake studies of specific development problems, which will be of direct assistance to ICICI in its operation and which will also have the benefit of adding to IBRD's understanding of the industrial sector. Specifically, the project will finance the foreign exchange cost of industrial projects carried out by productive enterprises in India and continue IBRD assistance to ICICI in a period when the organization is making efforts to diversify its sources of foreign exchange."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84b7d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84b7d_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUL-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84b7c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84b7c_1_0","DocDate":"05-JUL-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902281370","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902281370","DocDate":"30-JUN-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101911565724","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101911565724","DocDate":"30-JUN-1977"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
