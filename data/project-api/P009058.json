Despite gains made in these three areas, weaknesses persist constraining the performance of the Turkish economy. The project therefore has three components. The first component will bring the MSTQ system to standards by: (a) capacity building in the key public sector institutions; and (b) fostering private participation in the system. The second component finances a foundation that will use seed capital to catalyze private sector investment in ITD (especially applied research). The third component aims to develop a venture capital industry by: (a) establishing a legal and regulatory framework; (b) rationalizing the tax treatment of venture capital funds; and (b) financing a role model venture capital fund and management company."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":57},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":43},"theme1":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Other trade and integration","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"50,44,48","mjthemecode":"5,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Other trade and integration","code":"50"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":57},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":43}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010041509584391","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010041509584391","DocDate":"05-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050415234392","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050415234392","DocDate":"05-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960929223432","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929223432","DocDate":"29-JAN-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
