To pursue this objective, the project assists in accelerating the economic transformation of the rural economy by increasing the flow of investment capital to the sector; augmenting the private sector's role in the rural economy; facilitating accession to the European Union; and alleviating rural poverty by financing farm and off-farm investments for poor segments of the rural population which currently have no access to credit. There are two main project components beside the project management component. The first component finances sub-loans on-lent through private intermediary banks (PIBs) to eligible private sector borrowers; micro-loans disbursed through participating non-governmental and/or private Service Providers (SPs) to rural entrepreneurs; and leasing of depreciable capital assets by PIBs and leasing companies to final beneficiaries. The second component finances incremental expenditures incurred in 1) developing suitable technologies to provide retail financial services to medium, small, and micro enterprises and entrepreneurs in rural localities through participating private retail banks (PRBs) and microcredit service providers; 2) establishing and operating a network of pilot retail banking offices; 3) operating, by SPs, a network of microcredit retail points; and 4) training and technical assistance in retail banking and micro-lending to PRBs and SPs, respectively."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":21},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"80,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"BC,FE,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Rural development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"76,51,39,75","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,4,6,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":75},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":21},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080730000927","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080730000927","DocDate":"22-MAY-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201475566","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201475566","DocURL":"30-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201475566","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201475566","DocDate":"30-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01032006082880","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032006082880","DocDate":"08-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00020205303545","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00020205303545","DocDate":"08-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010061114520408","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010061114520408","DocDate":"02-JUL-1996"}],"countryname":"Romania","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
