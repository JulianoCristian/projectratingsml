Specific objectives are to reduce severe malnutrition by 50% among children 6 - 36 months, increase the proportion of children in normal or only mild malnourishment status, and to contribute to reductions in infant mortality and the incidence of low birth weight.

B. Communications finances production and distribution of audio-visual materials, local consultancies for message design and development, training, surveys and incremental salary and other operating costs. C. Community mobilization finances support to village women's organizations and special educational programs for women and adolescent girls, including incremental worker honoraria and other operating costs. D. Project management and evaluation finances furnishing and equipping of a project management office in each state, its operating costs, local consultancies, surveys and operations research, including the costs of therapeutic nutrition supplements under optional delivery arrangements."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":11},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"106,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Rural development","Human development"],"themecode":"68,78,69,57,63","mjthemecode":"8,7,8,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123273015","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123273015","DocDate":"23-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123272814","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123272814","DocDate":"23-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123273116","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123273116","DocURL":"23-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123273015","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123273015","DocURL":"23-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123272814","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123272814","DocURL":"23-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123273116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123273116","DocDate":"23-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e085b1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e085b1_1_0","DocDate":"04-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e085ad_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e085ad_1_0","DocDate":"04-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e085ac_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e085ac_1_0","DocDate":"04-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e99ba4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99ba4_1_0","DocDate":"04-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99ba2_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99ba2_1_0","DocDate":"04-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e99ba1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99ba1_1_0","DocDate":"04-SEP-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960929050359","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960929050359","DocDate":"07-AUG-1990"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
