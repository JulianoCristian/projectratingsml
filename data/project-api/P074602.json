It will help build the foundation for a) the improvement of public service delivery, and basic social services, through promotion of accountability, and transparency in the use of public funds, including external assistance; b) the Government's efforts to deepen institutional, and structural reforms for sustained economic recovery, and poverty reduction; and, c) the establishment of a track record for early access to relief, under the Enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative. By focusing on public expenditure management, rural development, private sector development, and pro-poor sectoral policies, it is expected the project will help move the poverty reduction agenda forward. Nonetheless, main risk factors include the internal conflict, the Great Lakes regional conflict, the uncertainty of the transition Government's capacity, and readiness to implement reforms, and fund the transition process, as well as the remaining uncertainty regarding the amounts, and timing of inflows of international assistance. These risks will be mitigated largely by the project design, which emphasizes donor coordination, and policies that support national reconciliation, to facilitate progress towards a cease-fire."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Burundi!$!BI","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"54,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Tranche Release Document,Credit Agreement,Program Document","countrycode":"BI","sectorcode":"FE,AZ,YZ,JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance","Rule of law","Rural development"],"themecode":"77,34,27,54,58","mjthemecode":"7,6,2,3,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":35},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":10},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060921150619","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060921150619","DocDate":"29-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000112742_20050127100847","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050127100847","DocDate":"23-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000160016_20030501144117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20030501144117","DocDate":"25-APR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201324220","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201324220","DocURL":"18-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000094946_02082304080933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02082304080933","DocDate":"29-JUL-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Burundi"}},"facets":{}}
