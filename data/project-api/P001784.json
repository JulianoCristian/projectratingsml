More specifically, the project aims to: (a) introduce a framework and criteria for selecting enterprises for rehabilitation, based on potential economic, financial and technical viability, and on management capacity to operate efficiently and profitably; and (b) finance the rehabilitation, financial restructuring and operational support to selected enterprises. The restructuring process would, where appropriate, include: (c) rationalization of capacity, privatization, technical partnership arrangements, or if necessary, closure of nonviable operations; (d) protect the environment and worker safety; (e) strengthen the Government's capacity to implement the rehabilitation program; and (e) support policy reforms and subsector reviews to strengthen enterprise operations in a market-oriented environment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":88},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"50,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"BC,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"44,43,25","mjthemecode":"2,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":88},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00080205344569","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00080205344569","DocDate":"19-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042310561356","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042310561356","DocDate":"20-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042310514957","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042310514957","DocDate":"11-SEP-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2008091609443574","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008091609443574","DocURL":"07-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022611254758","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022611254758","DocDate":"07-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000021321_2008091609443574","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2008091609443574","DocDate":"07-FEB-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08082_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08082_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e08081_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08081_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e08080_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e08080_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927234923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927234923","DocDate":"21-NOV-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927235052","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927235052","DocDate":"21-NOV-1989"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique"}},"facets":{}}
