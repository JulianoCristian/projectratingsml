The SPDPL will also lay the foundation for a program of future Bank assistance, as outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period FYO5-FY 10, in support of the country's social policy programs, through multi-sector programmatic DPLs, as well as through investment and technical assistance operations. The proposed SPDPL will therefore support specific actions to increase the efficiency, coverage, and sustainability of Uruguay's health, education, and social protection sectors and programs. The policy measures supported under the SPDPL seek to achieve steeper reduction in poverty levels in the aftermath of the crisis, over and above that which would have resulted without the supported measures, and, improved equity and efficiency of social sector expenditures. Given the single-tranche status of the project, the associated risks are considered low to moderate. Risks of non-compliance with expected actions are considered minimal; however, there are important sustainability risks, as some of the SPDPL-supported actions represent the starting point of reforms that will require continuation over time to be effective. These sustainability risks can be classified as political, economic, and managerial. Risks however, will be mitigated by a continued and strong policy dialogue with the Government. Economic and financial risks relate to the possibility of potential fiscal restrictions that would limit implementation of propose"},"country_namecode":"Oriental Republic of Uruguay!$!UY","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":44},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":9},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"75,380,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"UY","sectorcode":"BC,BK,JB,JA,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,54,51,65,67","mjthemecode":"8,8,6,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":44},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":13},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070315125711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070315125711","DocDate":"26-FEB-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2005082914031094","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2005082914031094","DocDate":"16-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2005082914031094","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2005082914031094","DocURL":"16-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050620150940","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050620150940","DocDate":"10-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050524084424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050524084424","DocDate":"28-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050504153437","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050504153437","DocDate":"18-APR-2005"}],"countryname":"Oriental Republic of Uruguay"}},"facets":{}}
