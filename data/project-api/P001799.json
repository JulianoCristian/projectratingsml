The program's components are grouped into three subprograms: 1) the institutional development will focus on an analysis of the structure of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP), its decision-making, and restructuring. Included is an assessment of its human resources, in accordance with the civil service reform. Strengthening MPA, at both the central and provincial levels, will improve its management, monitoring and evaluation, among other areas. The development of an agriculture information system is included, as well as the potentiality for MAP to formulate policy analysis; 2) the agricultural support services will include agricultural research in farming systems' technologies, increasing farmers participation, as well as developing partnerships in extension services for production intensification, further involving gender and environmental issues. Legal and regulatory enforcement will support crop and livestock production; and, 3) the natural resources management will focus on the development of a conservation program for forestry and wildlife management. Thus, support for land management and irrigation development will be provided."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":45},"sector3":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Brief,Brief,Brief,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MZ","sectorcode":"AT,AI,AB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rural development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,86,79,75,25","mjthemecode":"2,10,10,11,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":45},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":5},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070821112734","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070821112734","DocDate":"15-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150130142516","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150130142516","DocDate":"13-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150130144538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150130144538","DocDate":"13-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150130143537","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150130143537","DocDate":"13-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022509530651","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022509530651","DocDate":"04-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910572679","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910572679","DocDate":"22-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911060836","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911060836","DocDate":"29-OCT-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mozambique"}},"facets":{}}
