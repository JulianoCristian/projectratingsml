The project is selective in the support it provides and focuses on the financing of high priority interventions for which significant funding gaps exist. The overall project is based on a new approach for addressing HIV/AIDS by supporting and strengthening community-based responses to the epidemic. There are four components to the project: 1) support for community response to HIV/AIDS (CRAIDS), through financing activities by community based organizations 2) support to the National AIDS Council and Secretariat, 3) support to the line ministries, in order to mainstream HIV/AIDS related activities into the work programs of all line ministries, and finance the Ministry of Health for support implementation activities, and 4) program administration."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Zambia!$!ZM","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"42,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ZM","sectorcode":"BH,JB,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"themecode":"69,87,88,57,65","mjthemecode":"8,7,8,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090401005842","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090401005842","DocDate":"27-FEB-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02122704010384","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02122704010384","DocDate":"11-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02120304010968","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02120304010968","DocDate":"27-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01021606172228","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01021606172228","DocDate":"02-JUL-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Zambia"}},"facets":{}}
