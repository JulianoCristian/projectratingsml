Specifically, it will: (a) support the Government's long-range land tenure reforms; (b) increase commercial livestock production and improve its efficiency; (c) promote equity through developing assistance programs for small- and medium-scale cattle-holders; (d) encourage improved herd management and range conservation.  It will, moreover, strengthen institutions responsible for both livestock development and wildlife management.  These objectives will be achieved through provision of credit and skilled management for the establishment of commercial ranches by individuals and groups according to national policy guidelines.  In addition, they will be met by far-reaching reform of the system of land-use planning and management; upgrading of trek routes; and technical assistance for institutional coordination, training and extension, project management, range ecology, and analysis of pricing, cost-recovery and taxation policy."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Botswana!$!BW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Livestock"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BW","sectorcode":"AL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Livestock","code":"AL"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006121739","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006121739","DocDate":"21-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702140036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702140036","DocDate":"31-MAY-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Botswana"}},"facets":{}}
