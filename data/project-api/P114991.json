Hungary was one of the first emerging economies affected by the financial crisis. In the past two years (2007 and 2008) the government made an impressive effort to address the serious fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances generated in the first half of the decade and restore investor confidence. However, the crisis reduced overall risk tolerance, and Hungary was still perceived as a high risk country due to the large deficits and liabilities that had been accumulated in the first half of the decade. Hungary eventually lost access to foreign exchange (FX) funding in the second half of 2008 and was forced to request a \u00805 billion repurchase-based (repo) facility from the European Central Bank (ECB) for short term FX funds."},"country_namecode":"Hungary!$!HU","sector1":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":10},"totalcommamt":"1,413,210,000","sector":[{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"HU","sectorcode":"JA,FD,BE,BC,FA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Economic management","Financial and private sector development","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"themecode":"67,56,43,21,40","mjthemecode":"4,1,4,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","code":"FD"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":60},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":5},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010101809184953","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010101809184953","DocDate":"18-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20090821020853","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090821020853","DocDate":"21-AUG-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000333038_20090813005855","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090813005855","DocDate":"10-AUG-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20090211142846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090211142846","DocDate":"09-JAN-2009"}],"countryname":"Hungary"}},"facets":{}}
