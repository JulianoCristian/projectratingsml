It will also enable the base-load thermal plant to operate more efficiently by running at more nearly uniform load. The proposed pumped storage project is the least-cost alternative presently available for supplying needed peaking capacity. Both gas-turbine units and additional conventional base-load steam plant which would release older units for peaking service were considered. Neither is as economically attractive as the proposed project. The internal rate of return on the investment for the project would be 19 percent with the additional power sales valued at prevailing rates."},"country_namecode":"Ireland!$!IE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"14,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IE","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67e33_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67e33_1_0","DocDate":"18-MAR-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67e32_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67e32_1_0","DocDate":"18-MAR-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903113673","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903113673","DocDate":"28-FEB-1969"}],"countryname":"Ireland"}},"facets":{}}
