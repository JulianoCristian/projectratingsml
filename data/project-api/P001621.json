It would also assist Malawi in continuing to provide for improvements of main and secondary roads, upgrading of an important section of the North-South road to a paved standard, and financing a transport systems study of the northern access route linking Malawi and the Tanzania/Zambia corridor. The proposed project would also strengthen transport planning and the management capabilities of the Ministry of Works and Supplies (MWS). Specifically, it would finance: (i) completing the third and last phase of DRIMP; (ii) a four-year maintenance and rehabilitation program for the main and secondary road networks; (iii) constructing a two-lane bituminous road between the Luwawa Turnoff and Champhoyo; (iv) providing weigh bridges and vehicles for axle load control; (v) furniture, training aids and equipment for the MWS' new training center in Lilongwe; and (vi) providing consultant services and training."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"44,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925180109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925180109","DocDate":"06-MAR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05de8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05de8_1_0","DocDate":"08-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05de7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05de7_1_0","DocDate":"08-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a5d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a5d_1_0","DocDate":"08-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101541","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101541","DocDate":"30-NOV-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
