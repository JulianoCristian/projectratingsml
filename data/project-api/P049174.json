The project will provide technical assistance, computer equipment, software, and training to enable the authorities to design, develop, test, and implement processes, procedures, and systems, related regulations and training programs for budget execution and payroll management. The reforms will include: a) development of a budget management law; b) adoption of a budget classification system; c) implementing a transaction based treasury ledger system; d) centralizing government payments; e) reducing reliance on physical movements of cash including implementing a direct deposit payroll system; and f) conducting a functional review of the Treasury Department.  The project will first assist in system design.  The system will then be implemented at a number of pilot sites and, after the pilot exercise, replicated across the country."},"country_namecode":"Ukraine!$!UA","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":94},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":6},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"16,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"UA","sectorcode":"BG,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"42,33,25,27","mjthemecode":"2,2,3,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":94},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050601153101","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050601153101","DocDate":"25-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3980313101831","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980313101831","DocDate":"27-JAN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229184507","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229184507","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Ukraine"}},"facets":{}}
