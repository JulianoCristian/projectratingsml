There are three main components. The first rehabilitates and upgrades electric utility distribution facilities in the central West Bank and the Hebron governorate, and implements a distribution dispatching center for the Jerusalem District Electric Company (JDEC0). The second component finances a management contract and technical assistance to strengthen sector institutions. It comprises four sub-components: 1) the three-year cost (fixed fees and performance incentive) of a performance-based management contract for the Southern Electric Company; 2) technical assistance to JDECo in areas where its own capacity has potential for improvement; 3) technical assistance to help the municipality of Hebron corporatize and commercialize its electric utility operations (business plan implementation); and 4) technical assistance to the Palestinian Energy Authority to implement the actions specified in the Letter of Sector Development Policy. The third component funds initial startup and operating expenditures, and helps to strengthen both the Hebron and Southern electric companies' capacities to operate as financially sound and technically capable power distribution companies."},"country_namecode":"West Bank and Gaza!$!GZ","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GZ","sectorcode":"BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,78,84,43,40","mjthemecode":"4,4,11,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070731113233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070731113233","DocDate":"27-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050412094613","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050412094613","DocDate":"29-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99082405303872","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99082405303872","DocDate":"12-AUG-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229182734","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229182734","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"West Bank and Gaza"}},"facets":{}}
