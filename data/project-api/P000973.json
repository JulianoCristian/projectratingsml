The project will cover Ghana's five major cities: Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tema, and Tamale. It will have five main components: 1) storm drainage; 2) sanitation; 3) solid waste; 4) upgrading of low-income urban areas; and 5) capacity-building."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"71,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"TA,BH,BC,WZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Urban development","Urban development"],"themecode":"72,74,84,73,71","mjthemecode":"9,9,11,9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":78},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20060808123448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060808123448","DocDate":"07-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20040630102755","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040630102755","DocDate":"28-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121275407","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121275407","DocURL":"20-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121275407","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121275407","DocDate":"20-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961008075521","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008075521","DocDate":"04-MAR-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
