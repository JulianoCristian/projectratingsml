The project emphasizes improvement in the quality of teachers and institution building. To that end, the project has three components. The first component assists institutes of education (IOEs) to expand and improve their capability to meet the urgent demand for qualified lower secondary teachers.  The second component assists three municipal IOEs to evolve into: (a) information clearinghouses; and (b) research and evaluation and monitoring centers. The third component improves management capability of the teacher training system. The Government plans to take parallel action with the proposed project to further improve the teacher training system: (a) to increase intake of students from disadvantaged provinces; (b) to experiment with training teachers to teach two subjects; (c) to increase IOE average weekly teaching hours by 50 percent (d) to increase female participation in teacher training; (e) to increase funds to equip lower secondary science laboratories adequately; and (f) to increase annual intake of lower secondary teacher trainees to at least 70 percent of the total intake at provincial IOEs."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u6559\u5e08\u57f9\u8bad\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6269\u5927\u521d\u4e2d\u6559\u5e08\u5728\u5c97\u57f9\u8bad\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u52a0\u5927\u57f9\u8bad\u529b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u534f\u52a9\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5b9e\u73b0\u666e\u53ca\u57fa\u7840\u6559\u80b2\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u91cd\u89c6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6559\u5e08\u7d20\u8d28\u548c\u673a\u6784\u5efa\u8bbe\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u9879\u76ee\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u9879\u76ee\u534f\u52a9\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u6ee1\u8db3\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u521d\u4e2d\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5b50\u9879\u76ee\u534f\u52a9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e02\u7ea7\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ee5\u53ca\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u76d1\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u9879\u76ee\u63d0\u9ad8\u6559\u5e08\u57f9\u8bad\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u53d6\u5e73\u884c\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b8c\u5584\u6559\u5e08\u57f9\u8bad\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\uff081\uff09\u589e\u52a0\u6b20\u53d1\u8fbe\u7701\u4efd\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u62db\u751f\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5c31\u6559\u5e08\u6559\u6388\u4e24\u95e8\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bd5\u70b9\u5f00\u5c55\u57f9\u8bad\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u628a\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u7684\u5468\u5e73\u5747\u8bfe\u65f6\u589e\u52a050%\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u589e\u52a0\u5973\u6027\u53c2\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u57f9\u8bad\u7684\u4eba\u6570\uff1b\uff085\uff09\u589e\u52a0\u8d44\u91d1\u989d\uff0c\u4e3a\u521d\u4e2d\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u914d\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u8bbe\u5907\uff1b\uff086\uff09\u628a\u53c2\u8bad\u521d\u4e2d\u6559\u5e08\u4eba\u6570\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230\u5360\u7701\u7ea7\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u603b\u53c2\u8bad\u4eba\u6570\u768470%\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"EY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other education","code":"EY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019104055","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019104055","DocDate":"14-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120373051","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120373051","DocDate":"11-AUG-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120373051","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120373051","DocURL":"11-AUG-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e07f2f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e07f2f_1_0","DocDate":"24-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926205229","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926205229","DocDate":"03-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926205027","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926205027","DocDate":"03-MAY-1988"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
