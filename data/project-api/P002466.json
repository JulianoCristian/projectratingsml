Food production would be raised by about 5,600 smallholders through rehabilitation of a net irrigated area of 5,100 ha in Farahaane, reconstruction of two barrages, and strengthened services such as extension, input supply, and on-farm trials and demonstrations. Special emphasis would be given to strengthening the Department of Irrigation and Land Use in the Ministry of Agriculture to implement rehabilitation activities and simplified land registration procedures. To ensure maintenance of irrigation facilities rehabilitated under the project, cost recovery mechanisms would be developed and water users organizations would be strengthened to eventually take over the operation and maintenance of the entire system."},"country_namecode":"Somali Democratic Republic!$!SO","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"28,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SO","sectorcode":"JB,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,77,59,64,85","mjthemecode":"11,8,7,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":98},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000009265_3961008080127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961008080127","DocDate":"26-OCT-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120505332","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120505332","DocDate":"28-SEP-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120505332","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120505332","DocURL":"28-SEP-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0846f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0846f_1_0","DocDate":"12-SEP-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960927171410","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927171410","DocDate":"30-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960927171257","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960927171257","DocDate":"30-JUN-1989"}],"countryname":"Somali Democratic Republic"}},"facets":{}}
