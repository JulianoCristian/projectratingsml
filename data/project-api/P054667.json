The operation's components are tied to three distinct phases - prevention, emergency, and reconstruction - and include an institutional strengthening component. The prevention phase consists of 1) flood construction measures on the northern coast, including river dredging, strengthening river defenses and bridges, clearing and building storm drainage canals in all areas, building temporary housing, and protecting archeological sites; and 2) drought mitigation measures in the Andean highlands including water management, producing forage for livestock, and a seed production program. The emergency phase provides limited support, to provide certain emergency requirements such as mobile bridge structures, plants, pumps and metallic protection structures. The reconstruction phase will likely rebuild key public infrastructure; resettle families in flood prone areas and equip them with infrastructure facilities and public services; and operate a labor-intensive rural works program. Institutional support consists of equipment, technical assistance, and training."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"Flood protection"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Water supply"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"WC,JA,JB,WD,YW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"62,78,75,52","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,10,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":45},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":12},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0108110400330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0108110400330","DocDate":"20-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201382766","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201382766","DocURL":"17-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201382565","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201382565","DocDate":"17-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201382565","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201382565","DocURL":"17-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201382766","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201382766","DocDate":"17-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000009265_3980203115420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980203115420","DocDate":"11-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929094836","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929094836","DocDate":"17-OCT-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
