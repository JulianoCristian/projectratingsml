The subloans will be complemented by grant funding from the State. The subloans will finance priority investments prepared by the municipalities with the assistance of the Municipal Associations, reviewed by GAPLAN and BADESC, including: urban infrastructure (street paving, bridges), productive activities (warehouses, grain storage facilities), community facilities (schools, social centers), equipment and technical assistance. The program will focus on strengthening municipal management and planning through the preparation and execution of investments according to economic criteria acceptable to the Bank.
