This operation is being as the second of a series of three sequential programmatic operations. The strategic vision of the PASS is to improve results in social sectors (mainly social protection, education and health), preserving in the short term, and enhancing in the medium term, the human capital of the poorest citizens. Consistent with this vision, the PASS has four inter-related objectives: 1) to enhance the performance of social sectors to promote human capital (health, nutrition, and education) for the poorest citizens, through a fundamental redesign of the Government's Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) program, and its articulation with critical actions in health and education; 2) to improve budget management to support the joint performance of the social sector within the CCT program; 3) to support the gradual introduction of performance agreements in key social sector agencies; and 4) to enhance transparency and oversight in social sectors."},"country_namecode":"Dominican Republic!$!DO","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":39},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":28},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":21},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Summary of Discussion,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"DO","sectorcode":"EZ,JA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"65,67,54","mjthemecode":"6,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":39},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":33},{"Name":"Education","Percent":28}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000452162_20130917155420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000452162_20130917155420","DocDate":"30-MAY-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011111612255312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011111612255312","DocDate":"16-NOV-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011020618440749","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011020618440749","DocDate":"06-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010122711484152","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010122711484152","DocDate":"23-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1","DocType":"Summary of Discussion","EntityID":"000333038_20101124235301","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20101124235301","DocDate":"23-NOV-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000356161_20101029015720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101029015720","DocDate":"18-OCT-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100930161349","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100930161349","DocDate":"14-SEP-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000020953_20110728105726","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20110728105726","DocDate":"09-AUG-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100823102323","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100823102323","DocDate":"09-AUG-2010"}],"countryname":"Dominican Republic"}},"facets":{}}
