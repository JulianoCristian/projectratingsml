It will build on research concerning technical and economic feasibility of non-sugar crops and extension efforts begun under the Bank's FY82 Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2115-BAR).  More specifically, the proposed project will provide 67 man-months of consultants' services, overseas fellowships, equipment and materials to strengthen MAFF's research and extension activities and provide credit funds for agro-industrial ventures.  It will also provide for an agricultural sector study, involving both the sugar and non-sugar subsectors, and crop diversification policies.  The proposed project, over the medium to long term, will lead to improvements in farmers' incomes, together with gains in Barbados' balance of trade."},"country_namecode":"Barbados!$!BB","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":22},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":62},"sector3":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"4,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BB","sectorcode":"AZ,YB,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,75,79","mjthemecode":"10,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":22},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":62},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214174115","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214174115","DocDate":"28-JUN-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625092845","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625092845","DocDate":"31-JAN-1987"}],"countryname":"Barbados"}},"facets":{}}
