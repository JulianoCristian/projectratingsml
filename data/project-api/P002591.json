In particular, the Project would support improvements in: (a) maintaining the existing road network; (b) transport planning and intermodal coordination; and (c) management, planning and operations in the road sector. The project would, over a period of four years, strengthen RBPC through: (a) technical assistance and training in management and organization, planning and execution of road maintenance; (b) provision of equipment, spares, limited supplies of fuel and bitumen; and (c) consultancy services for a highway organization and investment study and financing for two ferries for the Nile Crossing at Ed Dueim. The main benefits from improved road maintenance would be lower vehicle operating costs resulting from a reduction in the rate of deterioration of all roads. The institutional aspects of the project would result in improved transport planning and increased efficiency of RBPC. The two ferries would result in savings in operating costs of vehicles which would otherwise have to travel a larger distance over sandy tracks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Sudan!$!SD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"16,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SD","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925155530","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925155530","DocDate":"22-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05e36_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05e36_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902421041","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902421041","DocDate":"29-FEB-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901013861","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901013861","DocDate":"29-FEB-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Sudan"}},"facets":{}}
