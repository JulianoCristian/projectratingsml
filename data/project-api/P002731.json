It will finance varietal trials and improved maintenance and rehabilitation trials over an area of about 1,200 ha; a seed garden for the product of hybrid seed nuts; soil and hydrological surveys; the preparation of a feasibility study for the next phase of coconut development; and technical assistance, consulting services, and training of Tanzanian staff. The project faces few risks, although the implementation schedule is dependent on the timely acquisition of seed nuts from other coconut growing countries."},"country_namecode":"United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"6,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Perennial crops"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TZ","sectorcode":"AP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Perennial crops","code":"AP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924195331","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924195331","DocDate":"28-DEC-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925051121","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925051121","DocDate":"08-MAY-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04248_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04248_1_0","DocDate":"07-OCT-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190236144","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190236144","DocDate":"30-SEP-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912492777","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912492777","DocDate":"31-AUG-1980"}],"countryname":"United Republic of Tanzania"}},"facets":{}}
