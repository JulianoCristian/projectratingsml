The project will have two main components: a) The infrastructure rehabilitation investment component will aim at protecting essential existing infrastructure from further decay and renovating some additional urgently needed economic and social services.  This component includes five types of operations: 1) heating and energy-saving measures for schools and hospitals; 2) urban transport; 3) water supply; 4) waste water; and 5) solid waste collection and disposal.  The institutional development component will aim at: 1) implementing the project effectively; 2) initiating a process to develop, over time, local capabilities in such critical areas as project and financial management, procurement, investment analysis, and environmental assessment and management; 3) developing coherent strategies and action programs, mainly at the local levels, to deliver key municipal services and control or alleviate serious pollution problems along Georgia's Black Sea coast."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","Percent":26},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":19},"sector4":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":17},"sector5":{"Name":"Solid waste management","Percent":12},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"18,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Sewerage"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Solid waste management"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GE","sectorcode":"WB,WC,WS,TZ,LA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Urban development","Urban development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,74,72,73","mjthemecode":"9,9,9,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","code":"LA"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Solid waste management","code":"WB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":26},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":26},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":19},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":17},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":12}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20080731040431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080731040431","DocDate":"23-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01032905304584","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032905304584","DocDate":"26-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703532785","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703532785","DocDate":"14-OCT-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123342801","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123342801","DocURL":"10-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123342801","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123342801","DocDate":"10-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b42f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b42f_1_0","DocDate":"08-NOV-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007080956","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007080956","DocDate":"17-OCT-1994"}],"countryname":"Georgia"}},"facets":{}}
