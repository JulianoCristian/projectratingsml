It would provide credit to farmers, improvements to extension services, purchases of rural road maintenance equipment, and technical assistance to the Ministries of Public Works and Agriculture. Main benefits from the project would be in the form of assured and less expensive transport of essential agricultural inputs and crops, and increases of farm income and employment. Realization of the expected benefits will depend heavily on the timely implementation of a variety of investments and activities by a number of agencies, on the pace of farmer acceptance of proposed improvements and innovations, and on access to credit by low income farmers."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Rural roads","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Rural roads"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"TR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Rural roads","code":"TR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925023431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925023431","DocDate":"11-APR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902304067","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902304067","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912391398","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912391398","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e352_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e352_1_0","DocDate":"27-JUN-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
