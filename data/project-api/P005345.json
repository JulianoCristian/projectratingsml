It will meet the country's needs in solid waste management facilities, as foreseen in the National Emergency Reconstruction Plan. It will strengthen the institutions responsible for solid waste management (SWM) and encourage private sector participation, not only in the collection services but in the whole sector, including the investment of capital in SWM. It will also help develop a Coastal Zone Management (CZM) plan that will serve as a tool to protect the Lebanese coast from further degradation."},"country_namecode":"Lebanese
