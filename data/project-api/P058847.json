To meet its development objective, the components will: 1) include the construction of a four lane expressway, and additional two lanes in the Kuitun-SailimuHu Highway, as well as upgrading the existing two lane roads to Class 1 (and/or Class 2) standard, combining new, and existing alignments. An eighty percent of the KuiSai highway will use the existing alignment, while new alignments will mostly serve as bypasses to urbanized areas in Wusu, and Jinghe; 2) connect primary local roads, and townships to the provincial, and national highway system, to ensure access to rural areas, and poor counties. The component will entail a four-year rehabilitation program, implemented under a programmatic approach; and, 3) strengthen institutional capacity, by providing training assistance, and specialized equipment, to address sector issues, key in preparing future sector reforms. This includes traffic safety, highway toll management, road management and maintenance, and transport facilitation."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
