The project consists of three components. The policy support component supports development of a legal and regulatory framework. The infrastructure development component provides technical assistance, equipment and facilities investments to establish and strengthen the securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement facilities. Finally, the public awareness component provides technical assistance to devise, develop and execute a mass media public awareness campaign.
