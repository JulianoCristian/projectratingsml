It will focus on supporting the Government's efforts to strengthen budget preparation, execution, controls and accountability, and help enhance governance, transparency and efficiency in the energy, cocoa, and financial sectors. The operation will provide financial support to the government in the context of the unfavorable global economic environment and the fact that Cote d'Ivoire's annual debt service to the World Bank will remain considerable until attainment of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) completion point expected for the first half of 2011. A rapid improvement in public financial management and governance and transparency in the energy, cocoa and financial sectors is critical to sustain the ongoing peace process and recovery of the economy. Specifically, the Government needs to ensure that scarce public resources are utilized efficiently and transparently to provide essential public services, that resources raised in the cocoa sector are effectively used to rebuild the sector, and that the overall tax burden is reduced to ensure that the farmers obtain a higher share of the world price. The Government has already implemented a number of governance reforms, and intends to pursue and deepen these efforts as it continues its post-conflict recovery."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire!$!CI","sector1":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":22},"sector3":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":34},"theme4":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Corporate governance","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"CI","sectorcode":"LS,LZ,FZ,BC,AH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"38,86,43,27,45","mjthemecode":"5,2,4,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","code":"LS"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Corporate governance","code":"38"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":34},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":22},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":22},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":11},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000386194_20120209235838","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120209235838","DocDate":"31-JAN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010082313271730","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010082313271730","DocDate":"25-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20100408235048","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100408235048","DocDate":"01-APR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000020953_20100325095127","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20100325095127","DocDate":"05-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20100323143617","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20100323143617","DocDate":"05-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000262044_20091209115436","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000262044_20091209115436","DocDate":"18-NOV-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cote d'Ivoire"}},"facets":{}}
