Except for a few main arteries in the north, however, these roads are mostly winding and narrow, serving local needs fairly satisfactorily but through traffic inadequately. The proposed project consists of the construction of a four-lane expressway about 17 miles long on a section which is in particularly urgent need of improvement on the route connecting Port-of-Spain (the capital) and San Fernando (the second largest city). In addition, to aid in preparation for future construction, it provides for feasibility studies both for the improvement of the remaining sections of the route and for a southward extension, as well as for engineering after confirmation of their respective technical and economic justification."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Trinidad and Tobago!$!TT","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"8,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TT","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912284221","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912284221","DocDate":"21-OCT-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67dbd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67dbd_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUN-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903000528","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903000528","DocDate":"31-MAY-1967"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903490464","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903490464","DocDate":"31-MAY-1967"}],"countryname":"Republic of Trinidad and Tobago"}},"facets":{}}
