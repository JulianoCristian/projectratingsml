There are two main components. The National Institutional Strengthening Component includes implementing programs developed under its pilot predecessor, the Municipal Development Pilot Project (MDPP) (report no. 12198); performing policy studies in key areas; and developing action plans for implementing them. Programs recommended by the MDPP include implementing a national management information system; a budgeting improvement program; streamlining access to social programs; and dissemination of best practices and lessons of experience. The second component, Municipal Strengthening, consists of three modules: the basic module is composed of municipal institutional development subprojects that focus on internal processes and improvements; the complementary module focuses on improving the municipality's management of key services by providing technical support to municipality's relationship with the community; and the flexible module finances newer and more innovative subprojects to address specific municipal problems."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":16},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"10,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"BC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Human development","Public sector governance","Urban development"],"themecode":"73,25,67,65,26","mjthemecode":"2,8,8,2,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":92},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050701131644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050701131644","DocDate":"13-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201422235","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201422235","DocURL":"13-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052010031347","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052010031347","DocDate":"13-APR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99031911060634","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031911060634","DocDate":"30-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910533710","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910533710","DocDate":"18-NOV-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile"}},"facets":{}}
