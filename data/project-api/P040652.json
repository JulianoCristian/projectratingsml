There are three project components. The first component, expanding access to affordable quality preventive, social, and curative services, will improve coverage for primary health care; improve services in selected secondary and tertiary hospitals; improve overall technical efficiency, increase initial stocks of drugs and medical consumable; and provide support to nongovernmental organizations for health-related activities and action against social exclusion. The second component, strengthening the health system management capabilities, will cover management training; recruitment and redeployment of health personnel; reforms of pharmaceutical sub-sector; logistic support for managerial functions; and support to the Management Information Systems. The third component, exploring and developing sustainable financing schemes for the health sector, will be done through expansion of cooperative cost sharing schemes; policy reforms on benefits; community participation; and cost recovery mechanism."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":97},"sector2":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"BK,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"67,69,68","mjthemecode":"8,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":97},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070822112917","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070822112917","DocDate":"11-MAY-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030811310641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030811310641","DocDate":"11-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910495659","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910495659","DocDate":"17-NOV-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903284554","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903284554","DocDate":"12-AUG-1998"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
