The Closing Date for Mali Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant, which is part of the second phase of a regional project, will be extended from June 30, 2012 until December 31, 2012. This will be the third and last extension of the project for a cumulative total of 28 months. Delays occurred during the first extension of 22 months mainly because: (i) an abbreviated resettlement action plan was required and its preparation took time and delayed the disposal activities of obsolete pesticides; and (ii) the procurement of a disposal company for the cleanup of obsolete pesticides took longer than expected including the finalization of the bid evaluation report, as well as the approval and signing of the contract which had to be done at the minister level given the size of the contract. Then, the project was interrupted following the military coup of March 22, 2012 and the suspension of operations in accordance with which is still in effect. As a result, no withdrawal application has been processed since March 22, 2012 and project implementation has been interrupted, until further notice. The extension of closing date is necessary to allow time for the possible resumption of operations depending on the conclusions and recommendations of the Operational Procedures (OP) 7.30 assessment mission scheduled in June 2012, and the finalization of all planned priority project activities interrupted in March 2012."},"country_namecode":"Africa!$!3A","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectAbstract>En raison de la pollution et pour pr\u00e9venir une plus grande contamination du sol dans le cadre de la protection des plantes \u00e0 Molodo, les objectifs sp\u00e9cifiques du Projet d\u2019appui au premier programme d\u2019\u00e9limination des stocks africains de pesticides p\u00e9rim\u00e9s au Mali sont de\u00a0: fournir des donn\u00e9es sur le site (emplacement, routes d\u2019acc\u00e8s, environnement imm\u00e9diat, adresses et coordonn\u00e9es des personnes et services responsables de la gestion du site, d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, etc.)\u00a0; identifier les dangers et risques li\u00e9s aux op\u00e9rations de Molodo sur la sant\u00e9 et l\u2019environnement\u00a0; identifier les t\u00e2ches \u00e0 accomplir par remblayage et adopter les mesures d\u2019att\u00e9nuation des risques appropri\u00e9es\u00a0; fournir un plan pour le suivi des travaux et la gestion du personnel impliqu\u00e9 ainsi qu\u2019un plan d\u2019informations et de communications (sur le chantier et avec d\u2019autres parties).
