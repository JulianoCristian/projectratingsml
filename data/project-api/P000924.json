In so doing, it will help achieve the objectives of the National Community Water and Sanitation (CWS) Program - that is to: (a) provide basic water and sanitation services to communities that will contribute towards the capital cost and pay the normal operations, maintenance and repair costs of their facilities; (b) ensure sustainability of these facilities through community management, private sector provision of goods and services, and public sector promotion and support; and (c) maximize health benefits by integrating water, sanitation and hygiene education interventions. There are three main components: (i) provision of water and sanitation facilities to rural communities; (ii) provision of water and sanitation facilities to small towns on a pilot basis; and (iii) capacity building for public and private sector. In all, some 1,000 water points and 30 small town water supplies will be provided."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":34},"sector2":{"Name":"Sanitation","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":25},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Other human development","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"21,960,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sanitation"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"JB,JA,WA,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,78,57,70,59","mjthemecode":"7,8,7,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sanitation","code":"WA"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Other human development","code":"70"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":34},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":33},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0103200650031","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0103200650031","DocDate":"31-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121215462","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121215462","DocURL":"17-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121215563","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121215563","DocDate":"17-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121215462","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121215462","DocDate":"17-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121215563","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121215563","DocURL":"17-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b379_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b379_1_0","DocDate":"14-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b378_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b378_1_0","DocDate":"14-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005103919","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005103919","DocDate":"23-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005103657","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005103657","DocDate":"21-MAR-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
