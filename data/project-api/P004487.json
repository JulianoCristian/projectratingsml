The project finances research on plant breeding, particularly on crops other than rice, and also on small-farm systems to develop technology which will effectively integrate crops and backyard livestock. It aims to improve the plant and livestock regulatory services of the Ministry of Agriculture and strengthen the Ministry's capability to plan, prepare and implement projects. It is expected that the expanded services will raise agricultural productivity and output, and will enhance rural incomes, particularly of small farmers. Through support of the second nationwide nutrition survey, the project will also strengthen the data base for the Government's Food and Nutrition Plan. Although the project's benefits do not lend themselves to precise quantification, a large proportion of the country's 2.35 million farm units could benefit from it, at a relatively small average cost per farm family."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"45,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Research"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"AR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Research","code":"AR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912534614","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912534614","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902380550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902380550","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
