The political change and resulting \"pause\" meant that the project suspended all activities. The amount of time requested for the extension is equal to the amount of time lost due to the suspension of activities under the \"pause.\" This extension will enable Honduras to complete the following activities: (a) completion of small works to reduce disaster vulnerability at the local level; (b) institutionalization of local disaster risk management capacity, and (c) completion of procurement of small goods and works packages for enhancing emergency response capacities for local and national government agencies. The credit supporting the Honduras Natural Disaster Mitigation Project was approved on May 30, 2000, and became effective on February 2, 2001. Following restructuring in 2004 the credit's original closing date, April 15, 2005 was extended by two years, to April 2, 2007. An extension to September 30, 2007 was agreed at the concept stage for the AF to ensure continuity until the AF was approved. The AF was approved on June 21, 2007 and provided for a three-year extension to September 30, 2010."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
