The two main components will: 1) support wastewater investments in the Anhui Province in eight municipalities, through the implementation of the first phase of the wastewater Master Plan. Investments include the construction of secondary sewers, and house connections; interceptors; pumping stations, and pumping/transmission mains. In addition, construction of wastewater treatment plants will also be financed in Guoyang, and Luan municipalities. The capacity of the Anhui Environmental Monitoring Center will be strengthened, by upgrading its equipment, and municipal laboratories, providing vehicles for field sampling; and improving technical, and managerial skills. Technical assistance (TA) will be provided for institutional development, for construction management, and will support as well staff training; and, 2) support wastewater systems investments in the Shandong Province to three municipalities, and in Juxian, Rizhao.
