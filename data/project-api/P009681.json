Because of shortages and unreliability of supply of electric power it is likely that only about 3,000 (6 percent) of the tubewells would be electric powered; the rest would be diesel powered. An important feature of the investments to be financed under the proposed project would be the generation of potential water supplies in excess of the needs of many individual farmers whose holdings in most cases are fragmented. Those farmers would be expected to sell surplus water to neighbors; such arrangements are common in the project area and rates are well-established."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"AC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","code":"AC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902212399","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902212399","DocDate":"31-OCT-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912425889","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912425889","DocDate":"31-OCT-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081dec52c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dec52c_1_0","DocDate":"23-OCT-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dec52a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dec52a_1_0","DocDate":"23-OCT-1973"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228b23_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228b23_1_0","DocDate":"23-OCT-1973"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
