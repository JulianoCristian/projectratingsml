The main objectives of the project would be to:  (a) increase enrollments; (b) improve the quality of instruction; and (c) reduce costs.  The project would accomplish increased enrollment by improving and expanding primary school facilities and introducing more liberal promotion.  Instruction would be improved by reforming the primary teacher training program, improving curriculum and increasing the supply of instructional materials and textbooks. Finally, costs would be reduced by expanding the low-cost experimental instructional program (Project IMPACT), increasing teacher utilization patterns, utilizing lower cost school construction designs and techniques, and introducing selective cost recovery mechanisms in the textbook program.  The project would also improve the management and administration of the primary school system by the strengthening of key institutions, staff training and the development of management information and project support communications systems."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"78,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925215626","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925215626","DocDate":"23-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135859","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135859","DocDate":"31-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e0613f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e0613f_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101258","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
