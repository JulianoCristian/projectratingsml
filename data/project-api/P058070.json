There are five project components. The first rehabilitates irrigation schemes such as refilling breached sections of embankments, raising low spots on embankments, repairing or replacing sluices, fixing leaking and improving inadequate spillways; repairing scheme access roads, and cleaning and desalting main canals. The second component finances community capacity building, provides support for social mobilization by nongovernmental organizations, repairs rural roads and drinking water facilities, funds small-scale micro-enterprise credit schemes, and provides technical assistance. The third component finances feasibility studies. The fourth component finances the procurement of road construction equipment, office equipment and furniture, hiring professional and support staff, and trains local staff. The fifth component hires technical and financial management auditors."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":48},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"27,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"BH,WC,JB,TA,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"26,58,78,57,77","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"10,7,10,7,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":48},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":12},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20051207090955","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20051207090955","DocDate":"22-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20040413130943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040413130943","DocDate":"31-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000160016_20040413130647","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040413130647","DocDate":"31-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201101575","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201101575","DocURL":"21-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99072609070275","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99072609070275","DocDate":"13-DEC-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99120105303286","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99120105303286","DocDate":"04-NOV-1999"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
