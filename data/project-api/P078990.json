The project will support the institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Education (MINED) through the establishment of a decentralized and participative education management model and the improvement of the quality of preschool, primary, and secondary education through provision of textbook and classroom materials, targeted programs to raise the profile and qualifications of teachers in rural areas and disadvantaged schools, and development of strategies and systems to monitor and disseminate learning outcomes. The restructuring will align programmatic interventions with the education policies and priorities recently adopted by the Government of Nicaragua, the Government of National Reconciliation and Unity (GoN). These policies are spelled out more concretely in the Ministry of Education (MINED) Institutional Strengthening Plan 2008-2011 (ISP). The restructuring will make revisions to the following project elements: (a) development objectives; (b) number and content of components, sub-components and corresponding intermediate indicators; and (c) component costs and financing plan and allocation of credit proceeds, while keeping the total project cost and credit amount unchanged."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
