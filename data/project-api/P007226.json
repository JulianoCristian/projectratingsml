The project consists of: (a) construction of about 26,230 feet of sea walls, including 21,230 feet in the East Demerara Coast and 5,000 feet in the West Demerara Coast; (b) purchase of hydrographic equipment, including one survey launch, to extend the scope of coastal erosion research and hydrographic studies; (c) preparation, by end of 1969, of an engineering and economic feasibility study of works needed to protect the Georgetown Esplanade; and (d) preparation, by 1971, of a study of improved sea wall designs including necessary hydraulic model tests and possible construction methods, and of an economic/technical study for selecting priority areas to be protected by sea defense works from 1972."},"country_namecode":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana!$!GY","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"GY","sectorcode":"TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903081928","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903081928","DocDate":"30-SEP-1968"}],"countryname":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana"}},"facets":{}}
