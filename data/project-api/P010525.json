There are nine components: 1) curriculum development, which prepares a strategy implementing a sequential and cyclical curriculum in all subjects for grades 1-9, improves curriculum management, and trains teachers; 2) textbooks/educational publications, which improve textbook content and physical condition, allow re-use and a multiple textbook option, increase private sector printing, and continue private sector delivery; 3) school facilities rationalization, which increases equitable and cost-effective allocation of educational facilities and libraries; 4) quality inputs, which supply educational materials and equipment matching the curriculum for elementary and junior high schools; 5) libraries (component), which provides books, shelves, resource materials, furniture, and trained staff in library management; 6) education management and planning, which upgrades planning capacity and develops national, provincial, and institutional plans, strengthens quality assurance and financing mechanisms, and defines policies and lines of authorities; 7) education financing, which implements a formula to improve resource allocation, trains staff, and allocates management tools and equipment; 8) impact analysis studies; and 9) project coordination."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"70,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Brief,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"BH,BC,ET,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,51,65,25,27","mjthemecode":"2,2,8,6,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":55},{"Name":"Education","Percent":26},{"Name":"Education","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Brief (BRI),  Vol.1","DocType":"BRI","EntityID":"000442464_20150130162224","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20150130162224","DocDate":"26-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060621145544","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060621145544","DocDate":"16-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123465104","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123465104","DocURL":"15-DEC-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980203115305","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980203115305","DocDate":"13-NOV-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183536","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052714544432","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052714544432","DocDate":"25-APR-1996"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
