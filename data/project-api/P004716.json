This would be accomplished by: (a) a training program for an additional 580 scientific staff, as well as for upgrading existing staff; (b) the physical development of 19 selected research centers in the regions, through the provision of additional scientific staff, research facilities, equipment, and housing; (c) reorganization and strengthening of the DOA and decentralization of research management and operations from Bangkhen (Bangkok) to the regions; and (d) strengthening the linkage between research and extension, so that research findings are more sharply focused on the practical problems that farmers face. Most of the approximately 5 million farm families would ultimately benefit from this project; however, major emphasis would be on upland crops and farming systems for rainfed agriculture, thus focusing on the poorest farmers in Thailand."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Research","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Research"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"AR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Research","code":"AR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006191325","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006191325","DocDate":"07-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902344447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902344447","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912492062","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912492062","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96bb4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96bb4_1_0","DocDate":"25-NOV-1980"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
