The components include: 1) consulting services, and technical advice to assist the Government in fulfilling its obligations under oil, and gas pipeline transit agreements. These services will focus on reviewing environmental, and social impact assessments, as well as strengthening environmental management capacity; 2) specialized legal advice concerning implementation of the various transit agreements negotiated, as well as revision of Georgian legislation as necessary. Financial, and fiscal management advice would complement the legal advisory services, under precise, and ad hoc terms of reference; 3) financial audits, to be conducted annually on company operations, but only partly financed, i.e., during the first year of operation; 4) non-pipeline oil spill prevention, and mitigation, addressing risks related to marine, and rail transportation of oil, by financing essential equipment to facilitate spill response, monitoring, and enforcement by the Ministry of the Environment. Consulting services, and training provision should complement this component; and, 5) project management expenses, through the provision of office equipment, project auditing, and incremental operating costs."},"country_namecode":"Georgia!$!GE","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":62},"sector2":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Other rule of law","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Other trade and integration","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"9,630,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GE","sectorcode":"BG,LC,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rule of law","Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"82,50,37,84","mjthemecode":"11,3,5,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other rule of law","code":"37"},{"name":"Other trade and integration","code":"50"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":62},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":29},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090814004829","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090814004829","DocDate":"25-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201185236","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201185236","DocURL":"25-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01022805315541","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01022805315541","DocDate":"15-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00121906040757","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121906040757","DocDate":"13-DEC-2000"}],"countryname":"Georgia"}},"facets":{}}
