This System is situated in the eastern and south central areas of South America, and underlies parts of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. This project is a first step toward achieving the long-term objective. The project aims to support the four countries mentioned in jointly elaborating and implementing a common institutional, legal, and technical framework for managing and preserving the Guarani Aquifer System for current and future generations. To achieve this, seven project components are envisaged: 1) expanding and consolidating the current scientific and technical knowledge base regarding the System; 2) jointly developing and implementing a Guarani Aquifer System Management Framework, based upoon an agreed Strategic Program of Action; 3) enhancing public and stakeholder participation, social communication, and environmental education; 4) evaluating and monitoring the project and disseminating project results; 5) developing regionally-appropriate groundwater management and mitigation measures in \"hot spots\"; 6) considering the potential to utilize the System's \"clean\" geothermal energy; and 7) coordinating and managing the project."},"country_namecode":"Latin America!$!6L","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":92},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":3},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":3},"sector4":{"Name":"Renewable energy","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"13,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Renewable energy"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Agreement,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"6L","sectorcode":"LE,EZ,JB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"81,85,57,82","mjthemecode":"11,7,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Renewable energy","code":"LE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Climate change","code":"81"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":92},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":3},{"Name":"Education","Percent":3},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090813231853","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090813231853","DocDate":"31-JUL-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060914583194","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060914583194","DocDate":"18-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010060114531782","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010060114531782","DocDate":"23-JUL-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02060104010962","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02060104010962","DocDate":"17-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02011104051316","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02011104051316","DocDate":"21-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0103300601005","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0103300601005","DocDate":"20-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010043013384155","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010043013384155","DocDate":"03-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010043013364856","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010043013364856","DocDate":"03-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052412195360","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052412195360","DocDate":"12-JUN-2000"}],"countryname":"Latin America"}},"facets":{}}
