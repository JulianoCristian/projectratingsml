The project would rationalize BADC's current fertilizer distribution system, improve transport handling contracting procedures, and remove major physical bottlenecks in the fertilizer transport system. The physical components of the project include: (i) port improvements - landing and storage facilities at river ports and channel dredging at Chittagong; and (ii) unit block/train operations - rehabilitation of railroad wagons and improvement of a rail wagon ferry service, construction of transit storage facilities and establishment of a fertilizer operations control center. The primary beneficiaries would be the farmers obtaining more reliable access to fertilizer at reduced cost. However, the movement of fertilizer is interrelated with movement of other products. Consequently, the economy, in general, would benefit from lower movement cost for many products."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925051547","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925051547","DocDate":"12-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e04542_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e04542_1_0","DocDate":"22-JAN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902362322","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902362322","DocDate":"31-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912495730","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912495730","DocDate":"31-OCT-1980"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
