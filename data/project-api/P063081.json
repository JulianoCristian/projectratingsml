priorities, and, for ensuring greater budget predictability for line ministries; and, strengthening budget planning and management processes within the MoF and line ministries so that the budget is implemented consistent with the strategies and priorities identified in the MTEF; 2) the Treasury Reform and Budget Execution component, to support Treasury, especially leading accounting reform, cash
