This project aims to create a more effective, accessible, and credible judicial system that will foster public trust and confidence in it and improve consistency and equity in applying the law. The project has four components. The first strengthens the institutional capacity of the judiciary branch by designing and implementing a new managerial and organizational model for the judiciary branch; improves administrative capacity and human resources, and strengthens the judicial career and civil service; and improves the operations of the court. The second provides anti-corruption support by improving preventive and control measures. The third strengthens access to justice by diversifying judicial services and reorganizing the Justice-of-the-Peace courts; expanding judicial infrastructure services; and developing a civil society participation program to promote access to justice. The fourth component improves social communication, and supports the Modernization Commission and the project coordination unit."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guatemala!$!GT","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de Reforma Judicial</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Legal services","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"33,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"GT","sectorcode":"BG","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rule of law","Rule of law"],"themecode":"35,33,29","mjthemecode":"2,3,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Legal services","code":"35"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20100805033534","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100805033534","DocDate":"30-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080828034304","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080828034304","DocDate":"10-MAR-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052412025258","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052412025258","DocDate":"22-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010033011051350","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010033011051350","DocDate":"22-JAN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052412091887","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052412091887","DocDate":"22-JAN-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guatemala"}},"facets":{}}
