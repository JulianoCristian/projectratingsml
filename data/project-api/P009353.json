Dacca is the capital of the new nation, and the other towns mentioned are important population, administration and business centers. The Government and the suppliers are presently negotiating the transfer of these contracts to Bangladesh at the original contract prices; since the contracts are expressed in Japanese Yen, the US dollar equivalent now is somewhat higher. Nevertheless, assumption by Bangladesh of these contracts, which were awarded after international competitive bidding, would be advantageous since it would avoid renewed bidding, which would take time and almost certainly result in higher prices. Two short microwave/coaxial cable sections included in these contracts are among the less important items which will be financed from other sources, or deferred."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"2,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,President's Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BD","sectorcode":"CC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","code":"CC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970625093431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625093431","DocDate":"25-JUN-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"President's Report (PR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PR","EntityID":"000178830_98101902191982","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902191982","DocDate":"31-OCT-1972"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081de350a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081de350a_1_0","DocDate":"07-JAN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e890_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e890_1_0","DocDate":"07-JAN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e88e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e88e_1_0","DocDate":"07-JAN-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903101255","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903101255","DocDate":"31-DEC-1968"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of Bangladesh"}},"facets":{}}
