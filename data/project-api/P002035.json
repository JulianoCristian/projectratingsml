Only direct foreign exchange costs would be financed by IBRD funds. Based on NIDB's present pipeline of projects, subloans financed under the project are expected to be in the areas of light manufacturing, construction materials, agro-allied industries, food and beverages and hotels. Most are import substitution by nature, aimed at the local market; a substantial number would be based on local raw materials. Average subproject cost is expected to be N5.0 million and average subloan and equity investment by NIDB about N2.1 million."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"60,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925023259","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925023259","DocDate":"22-OCT-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902301624","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902301624","DocDate":"30-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e340_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e340_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e33f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e33f_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9769d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9769d_1_0","DocDate":"15-JUN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912390689","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912390689","DocDate":"31-MAY-1978"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
