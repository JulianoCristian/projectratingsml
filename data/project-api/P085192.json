The surveys, and the national rapid poverty assessments (NPAs) carried out at the grassroots level, confirm that living conditions in Rwanda, while slowly improving since 1994, continue to be very poor, particularly in rural areas. Development partners strongly supported Rwanda's PRSP process, and have universally commended the Government of Rwanda (GoR) for the consultative manner through which it was developed. The PRSP was endorsed by the Boards of the Bank and Fund on August 12, 2002. The strategy was complemented by the development of an Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The PRSP identifies the private sector as the main engine of growth, with the transformation of agriculture and the rural economy as the leading source of growth in the near to medium term. To deal with the legacies of genocide and structural impediments to economic transformation, the PRSP outlines five basic building blocks for economic growth and poverty reduction-macroeconomic stability, human development, good governance, partnership, and the prioritization of public actions-and six priority action areas (a) rural development and agricultural transformation; (b) human development; (c) economic infrastructure; (d) good governance; (e) private sector development; and (f) institutional capacity building (see Box 2). The PRSP stresses the importance of defining sectoral strategies and associated (MTEFs) to guide public actions for implementation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
