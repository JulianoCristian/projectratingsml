It is estimated that, by 1987, some 3.3 million of the 4.6 million urban poor would have reasonable access to safe water as a result of the project. An additional 10,000 jobs for 30 months would be provided during project construction. The major risk associated with this project relates to the ability of MWSS to improve its capacity to construct and operate a much larger water supply system. This risk would be minimized by the substantial provision in the project for technical assistance and training and by the proposed reorganization of MWSS with branch offices for operation and maintenance. Close supervision ofthe project will be required."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"88,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925024133","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925024133","DocDate":"04-MAR-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902312136","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902312136","DocDate":"31-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912390485","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912390485","DocDate":"31-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e380_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e380_1_0","DocDate":"25-JUL-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e37a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e37a_1_0","DocDate":"25-JUL-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
