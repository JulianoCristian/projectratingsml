The restructuring will: 1) sharpen the project development objective (PDO) and modify the project results indicators to reflect changed ground realities, enable better tracking of implementation progress and improve the possibility of sustainable achievement of development outcomes; 2) realign project activities to conform to current revenue administration modernization and reform priorities included in an action plan adopted by the FBR with clear implementation benchmarks to improve project performance and achieve sustainable outcomes within a realistic time frame. Since its adoption in October 2008, the action plan has proven to be an effective management tool for tax administration reform; 3) cancel an amount of US$ 49.095 million' from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan (US$ 24.278 million) and International Development Association (IDA) credit (US$ 24.817 million) to reflect changes in the FBR's information technology (IT) and automation strategy; 4) reallocate remaining credit and grant proceeds to match revised project activities and costs; 5) improve FBR project management through the appointment of well-trained and committed staff and consultants to considerably strengthen implementation capacity; 6) classify the project as environmental category 'B' and introduce measures to ensure compliance with OP/BP 4.0 1 (environmental assessment); and 7) extend the closing date to December 31, 2011 to support the renewed reform momentum on tax administration, improve revenue collection performance against the
