Different supply options, phasing and technical alternatives were examined. The proposed Phase I project is the least-cost alternative to meet the Republic's priority water needs. The project's primary objectives are: (i) to ensure adequate water supplies to major cities as well as to rural areas; and (ii) to maintain vitally important irrigated crop production in an area threatened by aquifer seawater intrusion. The project also aims to rationalize further the utilization of the country's scarce water resources in Cyprus through the establishment of appropriate institutions and the implementation of realistic cost recovery measures for both domestic and irrigation water. The project components include: (a) a major dam and appurtenant structures; (b) a main conveyor (110 km) and connecting pipelines; (c) a pressurized irrigation network; (d) a terminal reservoir; (e) domestic water treatment and conveyance works; (f) establishment of project administration including a central water control system; and (g) provision of consultant services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Cyprus!$!CY","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"27,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CY","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006143239","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006143239","DocDate":"17-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99a9d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99a9d_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902434423","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902434423","DocDate":"29-FEB-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Cyprus"}},"facets":{}}
