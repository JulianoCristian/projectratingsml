This will provide integrated services to those SSEs which presently do not receive adequate institutional credit and high quality technical assistance.  It will also strengthen BPMB institutionally, and expand MIDF's SSE lending. Over the 3-year project period, some 1,100-1,200 subloans will be made with an average size of US$75,000-US$89,000. Under the TA component, the project will provide staff training for the participating agencies, equipment for workshops, laboratories and classrooms, expansion of physical facilities and recruitment of experts/advisors.  The project will also strengthen the coordination mechanism for financial and technical assistance and the monitoring and evaluation of all TA programs."},"country_namecode":"Malaysia!$!MY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"52,100,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MY","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925213945","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925213945","DocDate":"06-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151228","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151228","DocDate":"30-SEP-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970904163051","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970904163051","DocDate":"30-SEP-1984"}],"countryname":"Malaysia"}},"facets":{}}
