These policy pronouncements are aimed at achieving lower STD and HIV incidence and fewer deaths from AIDS in Indonesia, and the aim of this project is to use intensive pilot efforts to develop institutional mechanisms and interventions capable of reducing transmission of STDs) and HIV in Indonesia. A core program for STD and HIV prevention in two pilot areas will be designed and implemented in partnership with local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); extensive monitoring and evaluation will identify which trial interventions were promising and worth continuing. The project consists of provincial level components and complementary central level activities. Provincial (including district and municipality-managed) interventions will introduce simultaneously and in the same localities various behavior changes and service delivery measures thought likely to achieve significant outcomes. Behavioral trials and other interventions to reduce or prevent risk will typically be carried out by NGOs and will include peer and workplace education, counseling and other measures targeted at different groups."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"24,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BH,BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"themecode":"88,57","mjthemecode":"7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20050714154853","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050714154853","DocDate":"13-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00090605390681","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00090605390681","DocDate":"16-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200223934","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200223934","DocURL":"29-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200223934","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200223934","DocDate":"29-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019175120","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019175120","DocDate":"31-JAN-1996"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
