The objectives of the project are to: 1) improve access to basic services through the provision or rehabilitation of community infrastructure; 2) improve the capacity of communities and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to plan, appraise, manage and maintain investment activities, through experience gained in the project; 3) generate additional income and employment in rural and urban areas through revenue-generating sub-projects; 4) enhance the capacity of Angolan institutions to collect and analyze poverty-related data; and 5) provide a better understanding of the main causes of poverty in order to help formulate effective poverty alleviation strategies and generate adequate policies for socioeconomic development. The project consists of the following two components: 1) a social action fund component which will finance sub-projects identified, prepared and implemented by local communities; and 2) a poverty monitoring component which will finance policy-relevant research on poverty and social issues, and systematic poverty monitoring through household surveys."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
