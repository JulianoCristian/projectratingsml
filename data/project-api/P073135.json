It will foster the shift from traditional natural resource management (mainly wildlife) to an integrated ecosystem management approach in targeted conservancies thereby enhancing globally significant biodiversity conservation and reducing !and degradation while at the same time providing increased income-generating activities. The project supports targeted conservancies on communal lands complying with the project's defined strategic criteria. The project also provides institutional support to the Ministry o f Environment and Tourism (MET), which is the governmental lead agency responsible for implementing the CBNRM Program. Project components 1 \"Ecosystem-based Income-Generating Activities\" and 2 \"Sustainable Ecosystem Management\" support site-specific on-the-ground activities. Project component 3 \"Targeted Institutional Support\" focuses on priority issues of the institutional, policy, and financial CBNRM framework. All three components are expected to provide replicable lessons for the remaining conservancy network. Project component 4 \"Project Management Support\" aims to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism to manage and supervise project activities."},"country_namecode":"Republic
