In line with the Country Assistance Strategy, the program would contribute to the objective of a more sustainable Brazil to reduce poverty and achieve a higher quality of life for all Brazilians in both rural and urban areas. A sustainable Brazil will also be a source of competitiveness and provide wealth for the future. The loan forms a significant part of the Bank's overall assistance strategy to an innovative, committed, and high-performing client. The loan will support environmental sustainability through policy reforms focusing on two major areas: (1) increasing the effectiveness and the efficiency of the environmental management system; and (2) mainstreaming environmental sustainability in selected sector policies and programs. This loan would be the first operation in a series of up to three loans over a four-year period. The operation does not involve additional spending and focuses on policy and institutional changes that should lead to more effective and efficient environmental management. A companion Technical Assistance Loan is planned to follow this operation. The program is expected to result in the improvement of environmental conditions in the medium and long term. The set of policy and institutional reforms supported by the proposed loan include: (a) increasing the transparency and social control of the environmental management system (EMS); (b) improving the effectiveness of the EMS through better coordination and clearer definition of responsibilities among the three levels of government; (c) increasing the use of economic instruments as compared to command- and-control mechanisms; (d) promoting sustainable development in the Amazon and the"},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"502,520,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"AZ,BH,BG,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"83,82,80,85,84","mjthemecode":"11,11,11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":60},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20050712100237","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20050712100237","DocDate":"29-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"005326160_2005011412110660","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005326160_2005011412110660","DocDate":"03-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"005326160_2005011412110660","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005326160_2005011412110660","DocURL":"03-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20040803094654","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040803094654","DocDate":"26-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20040525111418","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040525111418","DocDate":"25-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20040406121029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040406121029","DocDate":"06-APR-2004"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
