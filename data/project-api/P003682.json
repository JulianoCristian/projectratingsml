Over the two-year commitment period for the ADB and IBRD loans, it is estimated that the IBRD funds will finance some 1700 subprojects creating significant employment and foreign exchange savings and earnings.  The project also provides for measures to support the institutional development of FDB.  There are no major risks associated with the project.
