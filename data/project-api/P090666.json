The project is to be restructured to allow Elektroprivreda of the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia (EPHZHB) to use savings of about SDR 110,000 for carrying out a study of solar energy potential in Herzegovina. EPHZHB is one of the three implementing agencies for the project. The project was restructured in November 2010 to extend the Closing Date to June 30, 2012 and reallocate the proceeds of International Development Association (IDA) credit among various disbursement categories. The request for use of savings could not be processed in November 2010 since the Bank had received a request only from EPHZHB but not from the Recipient, which has been since received."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of
