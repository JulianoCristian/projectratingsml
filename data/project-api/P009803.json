The project will aim at: (i) improving the definition of onshore and offshore petroleum prospects through additional seismic surveys; (ii) accelerating ONGC's on shore and offshore exploratory drilling programs in the project area; and (iii) providing technical assistance in the drilling, testing and completion of deep high-pressure gas wells and drilling in the outer shelf and, as required, for improving the quality control of geophysical data acquisition and processing. While the exploration of the area presents significant technical challenges, prospects for establishing substantial commercial petroleum resources are reasonably high."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"165,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"GI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","code":"GI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925135051","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925135051","DocDate":"30-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e97440_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97440_1_0","DocDate":"19-OCT-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9743e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9743e_1_0","DocDate":"19-OCT-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902403361","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902403361","DocDate":"30-SEP-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912583199","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912583199","DocDate":"30-SEP-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
