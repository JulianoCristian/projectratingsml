Project components include: (i) extension, credit and other agricultural support services; (ii) provision of land titles; (iii) construction and improvement of rural roads and bridges; (iv) construction of administrative, community and marketing centers; (v) provision of potable water, primary health care services and school facilities; and (vi) preparation of a future second rural development project in Esmeraldas Province. The main risk which this project faces is institutional. Ecuador's agricultural public sector has traditionally been weak and uncoordinated, resulting in frequent delays in project execution. However, the Government has now established a Secretariat for Integrated Rural Development in order to provide the coordination that is needed for this type of multi-sector project. This new agency is expected to facilitate the project's execution. Additionally, close supervision and technical assistance have been included in the proposed project to help minimize such risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"17,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925065610","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925065610","DocDate":"13-AUG-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902380755","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902380755","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912542371","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912542371","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
