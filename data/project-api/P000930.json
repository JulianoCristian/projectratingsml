This will be achieved through a combination of institutional and policy reforms and investment that will give producers improved access to livestock health services, water and forage resources, improved breeding stock, improved animal production technology and markets. The institutional and policy reforms include:  charging full cost recovery prices for government services in an effort to promote privatization of animal health services; closing down non-productive government farms; restructuring the Ministry of Agriculture's animal production and health services; and community involvement in the development, operation and maintenance of livestock water supplies.  Project investments comprise:  (a) strengthening animal health services and developing their infrastructure; (b) developing forage production on range and farm lands; (c) developing livestock water supplies; (d) improving livestock breeds; (e) introducing a pilot dairy development scheme; and (f) institution building."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":72},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":28},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"22,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"BC,AJ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,78,25","mjthemecode":"2,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":72},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":28}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000094946_01080804021424","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01080804021424","DocDate":"22-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00092205320243","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00092205320243","DocDate":"30-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121142791","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121142791","DocURL":"21-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121142791","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121142791","DocDate":"21-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1221c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1221c_1_0","DocDate":"08-DEC-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961003071008","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003071008","DocDate":"11-NOV-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003070836","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003070836","DocDate":"11-NOV-1992"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
