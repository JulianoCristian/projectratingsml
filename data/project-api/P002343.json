It further seeks the disengagement of the Societe d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des Terres du Delta du Fleuve Senegal et des Vallees du Fleuve Senegal et de la Faleme (SAED) from its production-related activities, a process begun under the IDA-financed Irrigation Technical Assistance Project. To that end, the project includes the following components:  (a) modernization of three perimeters (7000 ha); (b) training of SAED's personnel and farmers; (c) development of a credit network for farmers; and (d) financing, on a decreasing basis, of part of SAED's operating expenses.  It also provides (e) maintenance equipment and spare parts for SAED; (f) studies on diversifying irrigation development in the Senegal valley; (g) strengthening of SAED's Planning and Development, Accounting and Training Departments; and (h) research, reforestation and health."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":19},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":1},"sector4":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":68},"sector5":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"33,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Forestry"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"AT,AI,JA,BC,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"77,75,78","mjthemecode":"10,10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":19},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":1},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":68},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3971023103626","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971023103626","DocDate":"07-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120330741","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120330741","DocURL":"05-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120330942","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120330942","DocDate":"05-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120330440","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120330440","DocDate":"05-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120330741","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120330741","DocDate":"05-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120330440","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120330440","DocURL":"05-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120330942","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120330942","DocURL":"05-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e078e9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e078e9_1_0","DocDate":"01-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e078e7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e078e7_1_0","DocDate":"01-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926042142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926042142","DocDate":"21-OCT-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926042054","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926042054","DocDate":"21-OCT-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
