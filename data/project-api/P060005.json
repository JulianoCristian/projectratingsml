The Urban Infrastructure component will provide funds to beneficiary cities to implement city, and district level, urban investments programs identified through participatory Local Development Plans, MTEF and screened through urban audits in order to improve the level of service delivery in targeted cities. The second component - urban upgrading and low-income development areas - will support slum upgrading pilot projects, and low-income, development area pilot interventions in Kigali, so as to initiate pro-poor, urban upgrading, and land development programs. Finally, the institutional capacity building component will finance sector studies, training, technical support and logistics for beneficiary cities, to selected Government agencies, and local private sector construction contractors, so as to develop capacity in municipal and financial management, urban environment, resource mobilization, implementation of works towards improved infrastructure projects.
