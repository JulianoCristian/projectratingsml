The project would include: (i) construction of about 1,250 km of 22-kV and 995 km of 380/220-volt distribution lines and installation of related equipment; (ii) provision of about 45 MVA of 22/0.4-kV distribution transformer capacity and street lighting equipment; and (iii) provision of consultant services to assist in detailed engineering and project management. The project would be an essential part of the Government's newly emphasized policy aimed at slowing down rural out migration by concentrating activities and amenities in well selected rural centers. The project would contribute to increasing productivity in the agricultural sector, creating employment and improving living conditions in rural areas. No special risks are foreseen in the implementation of the project."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"42,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924213157","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924213157","DocDate":"23-JUN-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000356161_20111116025510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20111116025510","DocDate":"25-JUN-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e49d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e49d_1_0","DocDate":"08-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e49b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e49b_1_0","DocDate":"08-MAY-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190232504","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190232504","DocDate":"30-APR-1979"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
