Moreover, the project seeks to help implement a high priority program of infrastructure improvement measures aimed at relieving traffic congestion and promoting transport efficiency in Indonesia's four largest cities outside Jakarta.  The principal project objectives are to:  (a) strengthen city government capabilities in the planning, implementation, and maintenance of traffic and transport facilities and services; (b) strengthen Central Government capabilities in the preparation and implementation of national policies and technical standards for the urban transport sector; and (c) establish a process of coordinating the investment activities of central, provincial, and city government agencies in urban transport infrastructure.  To achieve these goals, the project includes financing for:  (a) major road construction; (b) comprehensive corridor improvements; (c) city-wide traffic engineering works; (d) road rehabilitation and maintenance; and (e) technical assistance and training.  As a result of this project, transport and traffic conditions will be improved in the four largest secondary cities of Indonesia."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban transport","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"51,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban transport"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"TU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban transport","code":"TU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019184548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019184548","DocDate":"29-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926050921","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926050921","DocDate":"27-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926050832","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926050832","DocDate":"27-APR-1987"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
