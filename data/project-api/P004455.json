The project will increase yields and farm incomes on about 80,900 ha in Southern Luzon, the Western Visayas and in Mindanao by providing better water control and improved drainage. Rice production will increase from about 234,000 tons of paddy at present to an estimated 516,000 tons at full development in 1988. Approximately 45,000 farm families and 11,500 landless laborers' families, a total of about 316,000 people, most of who are below the poverty line, will benefit directly from increased production and subsequent employment. In Mindanao, it will provide for a control program in four schistosomiasis affected irrigation systems. The main risk concerns the availability at the right levels and at right time of the entire package of agricultural supporting services. The project provides measures to minimize this risk. An additional possible risk will be failure to properly maintain the irrigation facilities. The project also provides measures to minimize this risk."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"65,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925011646","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925011646","DocDate":"22-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925015441","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925015441","DocDate":"07-JUN-1989"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f6b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f6b_1_0","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902294980","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902294980","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912305346","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912305346","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
