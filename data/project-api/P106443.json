The project was originally approved on June 2, 2008 for a total grant amount of US$32 million from the Australian Agency for International Aid (AusAID). In view of implementation delays encountered by the project, the changes include: (a) reallocation of grant proceeds across expenditure categories; (b) extension of closing date from December 31, 2012 to May 31, 2013; and (c) adjustment of the results framework targets to reflect the extension period and align these with the current targets in the Philippine Development Plan 2011-2016. This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension was for 18 months, from July 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012."},"country_namecode":"Republic of the Philippines!$!PH","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Project Paper,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"PH","sectorcode":"EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development"],"themecode":"65","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20140701101056","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20140701101056","DocDate":"30-MAY-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b0820c80aa_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0820c80aa_1_0","DocDate":"26-NOV-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081c5b592_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c5b592_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000445729_20130604094421","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130604094421","DocDate":"30-MAY-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000445729_20130604094321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130604094321","DocDate":"30-MAY-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20121223231345","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121223231345","DocDate":"20-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000333038_20121223230731","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121223230731","DocDate":"20-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081825cf9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081825cf9_1_0","DocDate":"19-DEC-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012041112383882","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012041112383882","DocDate":"11-APR-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20110705042503","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110705042503","DocDate":"30-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20110705042300","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20110705042300","DocDate":"30-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011042607235559","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011042607235559","DocDate":"26-APR-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000386194_20121127002536","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121127002536","DocDate":"14-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000076092_20080115125713","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000076092_20080115125713","DocDate":"14-JAN-2008"}],"countryname":"Republic of the Philippines"}},"facets":{}}
