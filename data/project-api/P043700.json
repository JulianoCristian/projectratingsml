The project goals are: a) privatizing port services and promoting private investments in ports by setting up a new cargo handling organization and constructing new port facilities under Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) schemes; b) facilitating access of foreign investors to trade-related transport; c) commercializing the railway parastatal and making it financially autonomous through institutional changes; and d) increased use of less polluting fuels. There are three project components. First, port and trade facilitation will remove potential bottlenecks to the anticipated traffic growth, facilitate development of modern shipping and port technologies, support implementation of the new port laws and regulations, modernize customs procedures, and develop modern data exchange systems for disseminating modern trade logistics among the port and trader communities. Second, railways modernization and restructuring will allow the railway company to become a fully-commercial enterprise. It will help the government finance an investment package to catch up with deferred modernization on the main corridor Tunis-Sousse-Sfax. Third, sector management will strengthen human resource management in the public sector and develop skills in the areas of computerized information systems, transport economics, and financial management."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":64},"sector2":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Railways"},{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"BC,TP,TW","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"PPP","themecode":"43,47,44,39,40","combined_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,4,4,5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"},{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":64},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":28},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060629110838","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060629110838","DocDate":"26-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980630180726","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980630180726","DocDate":"03-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20051011182959","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051011182959","DocDate":"03-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183527","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia","ccsa_practice_name":"Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
