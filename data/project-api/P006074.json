The principal objectives of the program are: (a) expansion of the existing generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet projected demand throughout the period; (b) improvement of plant efficiency to reduce specific fuel consumption and relative cost per generated kilowatt hour (kWh); (c) improvement of the transmission and distribution systems by utilization of appropriate design to keep energy losses at a minimum; (d) improvement of BLPC's institutional capability by developing long range planning for generation and plant; and (e) undertaking an energy conservation program and maximizing the use of indigenous energy resources such as gas and bagasse. The Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange costs of distribution components that are not being financed by other sources. In addition it would finance the foreign exchange costs of studies for energy conservation, generation expansion and tariff structure."},"country_namecode":"Barbados!$!BB","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BB","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925060918","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925060918","DocDate":"30-APR-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e975da_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975da_1_0","DocDate":"06-JAN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e975d9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975d9_1_0","DocDate":"06-JAN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902363038","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902363038","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912513694","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912513694","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"}],"countryname":"Barbados"}},"facets":{}}
