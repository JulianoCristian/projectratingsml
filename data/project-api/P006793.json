The project objectives are to: (a) increase crop production in six districts, through rehabilitation and improved technical and extension services leading to more intensive land use; (b) improve the incomes of some 3,900 poor farmers located on the foothills of the Andes and in the savannah country of Northern Colombia through small-scale irrigation development; (c) partially restore the agricultural production base in the area affected by the recent volcanic disaster through reconstruction and addition of irrigation facilities; and (d) improve the sustainability and replicability of public irrigation investments through full recovery of operation and maintenance costs and the building up of water user associations. The average beneficiary per capita income of US$1,060 before the project is expected to rise to about US$1,940 at full development."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":68},"sector2":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":27},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"114,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"BC,AZ,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Rural development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"51,75,78,52","mjthemecode":"6,10,10,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":68},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":27},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3971023103636","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971023103636","DocDate":"16-MAY-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094341","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094341","DocDate":"28-FEB-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165524","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165524","DocDate":"28-FEB-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
