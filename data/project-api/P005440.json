The proposed project would build on pilot-scale efforts financed by the Health Development Project which has helped establish sound standards and flexible institutional arrangements for the delivery of primary health care. It is designed to rehabilitate essential basic health services using existing infrastructure. It would provide the resources required to reinforce priority health programs in primary care and at the first level of referral; strengthen the administration and management of health services; and the maintenance of buildings and biomedical equipment. It would also support ongoing Ministry of Health (MOH) efforts to test and implement various improvements in service quality and efficiency; increase cost recovery for curative care; facilitate the mobilization of additional resources in support of the sector; and streamline arrangements for services financed by public and private sector insurance funds."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Tuberculosis","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"104,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Human development","Rural development","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"63,78,69,93,67","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,8,8,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","code":"93"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Child health","code":"63"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042910114507","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042910114507","DocDate":"08-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040809463708","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040809463708","DocDate":"15-JUN-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960928082217","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960928082217","DocDate":"08-JAN-1990"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
