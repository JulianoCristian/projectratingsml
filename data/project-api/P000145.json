In particular, programs for tuberculosis, sexually-transmitted diseases and maternal and child health will be strengthened; family planning made available on demand to most of the population; and new population programs developed. The project's support will take the form of finance for physical facilities, equipment, supplies, technical assistance and consultancies. The project is likely to result in a significant improvement in the health of the Botswana in the medium-term, lay a sound foundation for further improvement in the quality of service and take crucial steps toward alleviating population pressures that could strain Botswana's limited physical and economic resources in the next century. The project is expected to generate recurrent cost savings through improved efficiency and coordination, apart from measures by the Government for cost recovery in the sector."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Botswana!$!BW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"11,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BW","sectorcode":"HB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Basic health","code":"HB"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925200031","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925200031","DocDate":"18-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99d10_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99d10_1_0","DocDate":"17-MAY-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902441885","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902441885","DocDate":"30-APR-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Botswana"}},"facets":{}}
