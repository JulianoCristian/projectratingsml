There are four project components. The first component provides advisory services through a local non-profit agency aimed at improving the profitability, productivity, and general operational, financial, and managerial efficiency of private and privatized enteprises; supports and facilitates development of a highly qualified domestic consulting industry; and strengthens the constituency for reform at the oblast level consisting of entrepreneurs, managers, local academia, consultants, and other stakeholders. This component, which focuses on enterprise restructuring, also builds incentives for the government to minimize its involvement in the enterprise selection process; for stakeholders to maximize cost recovery of consultant services; for developing the local consulting market; and for foreign consultants to train and mentor local consultants. Under the second component, the implementing agency will design, subcontract, and supervise in-house training courses for selected candidates who, in turn, will be required upon completion of their secondment programs, to proactively contribute to disseminating their knowledge and experience to the business community. The third component finances monitoring and project administration. The fourth component improves the regulatory environment by providing performance-based incentives for deregulation."},"country_namecode":"Ukraine!$!UA","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"UA","sectorcode":"YZ,BH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,43,34,41","mjthemecode":"4,3,4,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20061003091016","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20061003091016","DocDate":"26-SEP-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02031504020543","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02031504020543","DocDate":"06-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_0203010410018","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0203010410018","DocDate":"27-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98111703531761","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98111703531761","DocDate":"15-FEB-2001"}],"countryname":"Ukraine"}},"facets":{}}
