There are three project components. The first rehabilitates small-scale social and economic infrastructure by financing micro-projects 1) to rehabilitate or upgrade schools, health clinics, water supply systems, sanitation works, irrigation, and other infrastructure; and 2) to repair school heating systems. This component also funds school furniture purchases, provides capacity building and technical assistance to local contractors and implementing agencies; and finances consulting services for micro-project design and supervision. The second component finances institutional strengthening at the local level, and builds capacity and supplies technical assistance to local governments and community-based organizations. The third component furnishes institutional support to the Armenian Social Investment Fund by financing special studies, assessments, reviews, vehicles and equipment, and project administration and management as well as annual financial, procurement, and technical audits."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Armenia!$!AM","sector1":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":41},"sector2":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":26},"sector3":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":17},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"20,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AM","sectorcode":"JB,AI,WZ,EZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Urban development","Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"41,78,51,71,57","mjthemecode":"7,9,6,10,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":41},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":26},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":17},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070509105704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070509105704","DocDate":"23-APR-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042613251969","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042613251969","DocDate":"17-DEC-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062414091272","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062414091272","DocDate":"13-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010030214563170","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010030214563170","DocDate":"19-MAY-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00042805302426","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00042805302426","DocDate":"18-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99032505582872","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99032505582872","DocDate":"06-APR-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Armenia"}},"facets":{}}
