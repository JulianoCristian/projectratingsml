The project implements measures to reform and improve the urban transport sector along guidelines set forth by the Government; and modernizes rail services to support the phosphate industry. The three project components: 1) invest in improving public bus services through enhanced maintenance of the fleet and traffic management practices, streamline operations of the light rail system in Tunis, and finance severance payments; 2) support institutional capacity building at decentralized level in management and regulatory matters, and includes technical assistance for preparation of bidding documents for construction and extension of mass transit systems; and 3) raises the productivity and cost efficiency of phosphate transport by rail by implementing an investment program to modernize traffic management systems and increase the infrastructure capacity in the phosphate railway network, strengthens the autonomous business unit in charge of that network, and finances redundancies."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tunisia!$!TN","sector1":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":52},"sector2":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"37,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Railways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"TN","sectorcode":"BC,BH,TW,TZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Urban development","Urban development"],"themecode":"71,74,73","mjthemecode":"9,9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":52},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20100702015737","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20100702015737","DocDate":"28-APR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000160016_20051011180911","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051011180911","DocDate":"21-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201544764","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201544764","DocURL":"25-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201544563","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201544563","DocURL":"25-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00030805305852","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00030805305852","DocDate":"30-MAR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01042109512211","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01042109512211","DocDate":"28-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01041906223361","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01041906223361","DocDate":"21-FEB-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0101300532184","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0101300532184","DocDate":"30-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01013105484055","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01013105484055","DocDate":"31-DEC-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Tunisia"}},"facets":{}}
