The specific goals are to: a) increase the capacity and improve operating conditions of major road corridors, central areas and strategic intersections by introducing traffic management and engineering measures; and b) strengthen the institutional capacity in traffic management and traffic enforcement. The project consists of two main components. The first component will involve improving traffic system on four main radial corridors and in two inner city areas in Hanoi City. It will also improve junctions and channelization and provide railway barriers at the junctions. The second component will improve the traffic system on four major corridors, at 14 isolated junctions and within the central area in HCMC. A fully responsive area traffic control system covering about 150 intersections will also be implemented in central HCMC. In both components, technical assistance, training, and equipment will be provided for institutional strengthening."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN","sector1":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":38},"sector3":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":8},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"42,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"VN","sectorcode":"BC,BH,TA,TZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Urban development","Urban development"],"themecode":"73,71,74","mjthemecode":"9,9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":42},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":38},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060725102924","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060725102924","DocDate":"22-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122113277","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122113277","DocURL":"08-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122113277","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122113277","DocDate":"08-SEP-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980901130124","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980901130124","DocDate":"17-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3971229183036","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3971229183036","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"}],"countryname":"Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}},"facets":{}}
