The project will finance the following three subcomponents: 1) upgrading of credit risk and borrower arrears information; 2) training in banking; and 3) study for the formulation of a strategy for the second phase of financial sector development. With respect to the private sector institutional and regulatory framework, the project will finance the following: 1) upgrading of the accounting and auditing framework; 2) support to the Chamber of Commerce; 3) strengthening of legal and judiciary framework; and 4) feasibility study of a tax free regime for exporters.
