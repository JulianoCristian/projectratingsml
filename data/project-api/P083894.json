The program focuses on the development of institutions and the delivery of public services that are critical for a stable transition to Independence and the effective use of future oil and gas wealth. On the basis of the Government's FY2005 budget submissions, budgetary and balance of payments support financing requirements for FY2005 are estimated at US$31 million, which should be fully covered by IDA and TSP partners' co-financing. The Transition Support Program (TSP) presents a sub-set of the highest priority actions drawn from the Government's strategic planning instruments (notably the National Development Plan, sector policies and Sector Investment Programs) and reflected in agencies' FY2005 Annual Action Plans (AAPs) and budgets. In consultation with Ministry of Planning and Finance (MOPF), Government agencies identified their TSP priorities, together with quarterly milestones and performance targets to guide implementation."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!$!TP","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Health","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":16},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Other rule of law","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"4,960,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"TP","sectorcode":"AZ,JA,EP,BG,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Human development","Public sector governance","Human development","Rule of law"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"37,65,27,67,44","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,8,2,8,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Other rule of law","code":"37"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000334955_20080901032213","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080901032213","DocDate":"30-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070821115225","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070821115225","DocDate":"19-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000014464_2010043013112409","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010043013112409","DocDate":"25-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000090341_20041007104507","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041007104507","DocDate":"29-SEP-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20040519154723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040519154723","DocDate":"20-APR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000012009_20040423144041","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040423144041","DocDate":"30-MAR-2004"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
