The reforms supported by the IRSC aim to enhance poverty reduction by: (1) promoting good governance, including: (a) enhanced transparency, accountability and adherence to the rule of law; and (b) using public resources transparently, accountably, and efficiently through reforming budget preparation, execution, monitoring and reporting, public procurement, and human resource management in the civil service; and (2) causing sustainable growth in rural areas through a profound reform of the cotton sector. The IRSC focuses on key elements that underlie improved public service delivery through improvements in budget preparation, execution, and monitoring and better human resource management in the civil service. The reform process supported by the IRSC will pay particular attention to empowering the independent institutions that provide the checks and balances for the efficient management of resources for poverty reduction in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, as well as in the media and civil society, including farmers' associations. Finally, the IRSC will complement and enhance the impact of other Bank interventions, especially the Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project, and it s associated capacity-building program for petroleum revenue management the Management of the Petroleum Economy Project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chad!$!TD","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":84},"sector2":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":8},"sector3":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":4},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":2},"sector5":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"TD","sectorcode":"LC,BG,YB,AH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Trade and integration"],"themecode":"49,25,27,30,77","mjthemecode":"10,2,2,2,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":84},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":8},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":4},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20060725173851","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060725173851","DocDate":"28-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010031116114872","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031116114872","DocURL":"01-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010031116114872","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010031116114872","DocDate":"01-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20041108092047","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20041108092047","DocDate":"27-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20040602161211","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040602161211","DocDate":"24-MAY-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chad"}},"facets":{}}
