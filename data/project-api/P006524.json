In addition, the project aims to begin mobilizing private resources for municipal service provision, test cooperative regional service provision in small, institutionally weaker municipalities and initiate transfer of municipal management skills to the less-developed North of the State. The project consists of five components:  (a) an institutional development component to upgrade municipal financial administration and improve municipal management and environmental planning; (b) an environmental infrastructure component to upgrade and improve basic sanitation and related services, primarily water, sewerage, drainage, solid waste, street paving and lighting in the State's municipalities; (c) small pilot programs to test private sector provision of municipal services, and regional cooperative investments in rural Northern municipalities; and (d) and (e) two studies focusing on:  the development of a State-wide strategy for local provision of water and sewerage services; and medium-term options for municipal infrastructure finance."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":29},"sector2":{"Name":"Solid waste
