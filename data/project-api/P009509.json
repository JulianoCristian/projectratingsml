The project will also facilitate the transmission of natural gas and telecommunications between the east and west in a cost-effective manner, as well as a meter gauge railway connection. The project consists of: (a) construction of a bridge about 4.8 km long, with a design life of 100 years; (b) construction of two end viaducts to connect the bridge to the approach roads; (c) construction of two guide bunds, of about 2.2 km each and a flood protection bund on the east bank to regulate the river at the chosen site; (d) construction of east and west approach roads; (e) measures to mitigate the project's effects on the environment, including resettlement, compensation of project affected persons, fisheries and wild life, and environmental monitoring; and (f) technical assistance and training."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of Bangladesh!$!BD","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government
