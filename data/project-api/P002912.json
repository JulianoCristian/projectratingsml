It will re-establish MOW's capability for road maintenance, develop local construction industry, improve the country's transport sector management, and improve and enforce vehicle weight and traffic safety regulations. The project will comprise programs, to be implemented over a four-year period (1984-87, including one year (1984) of tendering and mobilization), for resealing and regraveling of about 600 km of bitumen-surfaced and about 1,000 km of gravel roads. Furthermore, these programs will include routine maintenance of the country's 7,540 km classified road network. Technical assistance to MOW and to the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will consist of a pilot program for the development of the local construction industry, and preparation work for a future road maintenance program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"58,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05e2a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05e2a_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAR-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902434931","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902434931","DocDate":"29-FEB-1984"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
