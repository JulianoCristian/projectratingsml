It will provide for sustainable in-situ conservation of genetic resources in cereals, horticultural crops, medicinal plants, forest trees, and pasture grasses and legumes through an integrated ecosystem approach. It will also contribute to the broader objective of conserving sustainable farming and forest systems that is a key element of the Watershed Rehabilitation project. The project will develop the institutional capacity in Turkey for preparing and implementing a national strategy for in-situ conservation which could include landraces in a second phase project, for which support from the GET will be sought. The aim is to test and develop a new approach to conservation of genetic diversity which has not been tried on a large scale anywhere in the world."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":39},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":29},"sector4":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"77,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,GEF Project Document,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"TR","sectorcode":"AZ,AT,AB,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"80,78,83,75","mjthemecode":"10,11,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":39},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":29},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":29},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000090341_20040409110753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20040409110753","DocDate":"19-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02062204010361","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02062204010361","DocDate":"31-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200103356","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200103356","DocURL":"25-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200103356","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200103356","DocDate":"25-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"GEF Project Document (PD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PD","EntityID":"000009265_3961219142230","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961219142230","DocDate":"28-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961003115347","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961003115347","DocDate":"09-FEB-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Turkey"}},"facets":{}}
