About 230 villages will be beneficiaries of boreholes equipped with handpumps. The project will stress villagers' direct participation from siting of boreholes through construction of waterpoints to operation and maintenance. Assumption by villagers of responsibilities for maintenance will be a key ingredient to the success of the project. The project will strengthen Government's capability to identify, prepare and manage this type of project. The project includes: (a) provision of about 340 productive boreholes in Western Mali; (b) supply and installation of handpumps and necessary spare parts; (c) technical assistance, consultancy services and a training program; and (d) studies to prepare for a follow-up project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mali!$!ML","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Rural water supply and sanitation","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,900,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Rural water supply and sanitation"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ML","sectorcode":"WR","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Rural water supply and sanitation","code":"WR"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019163029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019163029","DocDate":"13-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05dff_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05dff_1_0","DocDate":"20-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e05dfe_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e05dfe_1_0","DocDate":"20-DEC-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970718101704","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970718101704","DocDate":"30-NOV-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901023566","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901023566","DocDate":"30-NOV-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Mali"}},"facets":{}}
