In order to achieve these objectives, a line of credit totalling US$55.4 million will be made available to the SSE sector. CFN will also continue to manage a program of technical assistance to SSEs, and will receive technical assistance in order to improve its financial information systems. About 1,200 subloans averaging US$45,000 are expected to be made to individual SSEs with fixed assets, excluding land and buildings, of no more than US$350,000 equivalent. Investments partially financed by these subloans are expected to create about 6,000 new jobs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ecuador!$!EC","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EC","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e97814_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97814_1_0","DocDate":"16-DEC-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97812_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97812_1_0","DocDate":"16-DEC-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902405089","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902405089","DocDate":"30-NOV-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912585342","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912585342","DocDate":"30-NOV-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ecuador"}},"facets":{}}
