Through its four main components, the project will: 1) finance the promotion for an increased private-public supply of basic, and secondary education opportunities for adults, which includes the establishment of a learning assessment, and certification system for adults, as well as that of new modules to encompass adult basic, and secondary education along with training, and distance learning; 2) finance, through a competitive Fund, vertical articulation of technical secondary, with tertiary technical-professional education, through the establishment of technological curricular disciplines. As well, the horizontal articulation of technical secondary, and tertiary education with the labor market, will be constituted through regional networks of educational institutions at the technical, secondary, and tertiary levels. Access to, and quality of education will be improved through pre- and in-service teacher training institutions; 3) establish a national system of competency framework, and professional-vocational pathways on selected sectors of the economy, and, four proactive learning, and training management information systems will be financed; and, 4) finance a national Project Coordination Unit, and in addition, support the strengthening of the national, and regional Training and Employment Service (SENCE), by financing computers, and equipment, training, and technical assistance, while a continuous communication, and dissemination strategy will be maintained."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Chile!$!CL","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Chile: proyecto de capacitaci\u00f3n y aprendizaje permanente</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":55},"sector2":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":38},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":7},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":28},"totalcommamt":"75,750,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"CL","sectorcode":"BC,EV,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"66,61,51,65","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,6,7,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":55},{"Name":"Education","Percent":38},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":7}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20120627013340","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120627013340","DocDate":"12-JUN-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20100824011156","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20100824011156","DocDate":"27-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201564644","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201564644","DocURL":"20-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201564946","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201564946","DocURL":"20-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02022104015367","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022104015367","DocDate":"14-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01032612442238","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01032612442238","DocDate":"13-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02030804041222","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02030804041222","DocDate":"08-FEB-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Chile","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
