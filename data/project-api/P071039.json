The two project components support (1) reducing the excess burden of government in the economy while increasing expenditure efficiency, and (2) improving financial and budgetary management in the public sector.   Expected benefits are to: enhance public spending efficiency and ensure macro-fiscal stability by good management of public resources; accommodate the medium-term macro-economic program and provide room for a reduction in the tax and contributions; contain wages in the general government sector; improve allocative efficiency of spending; clarify intergovernmental revenue and expenditure assignments; and increase transparency and accountability in government transactions. Among the risks faced by the credit are: The possibility of the authorities either delaying the implementation of some measures or even reversing their commitment to some parts of the Program; weak administrative capacity to implement and monitor the Program; and macroeconomic risk arising from the country's still fragile position. The credit is to be released in two tranches."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"34,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BA","sectorcode":"ET,BG,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Economic management","Human development"],"themecode":"66,23,25,27,29","mjthemecode":"2,2,2,1,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other accountability/anti-corruption","code":"29"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070817115922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070817115922","DocDate":"16-AUG-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010030111502493","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111502493","DocURL":"21-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010030111502493","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111502493","DocDate":"21-JUL-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20040526104511","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040526104511","DocDate":"17-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_03061804052787","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03061804052787","DocDate":"15-OCT-2003"}],"countryname":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}},"facets":{}}
