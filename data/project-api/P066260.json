Routine maintenance works will be contracted by the private sector, to include pavement, drainage systems, road signaling maintenance works during an overall period of three years. Periodic maintenance works on pavement, and bridges of the rural road network, shall be based on an engineering analysis, and assessment of socioeconomic conditions. Under this component, equipment for road surveys, vehicles, office equipment, and computers will be supplied. Training and technical assistance (TA) will be provided for the restructuring, management organization and systems of the main national and rural roads, which includes design and recommendations on road user charges, disbursement mechanisms, and financing. 2) Traffic safety remedial works will include horizontal, and vertical signalization, improvements of road pavement and shoulders, and installation of roadside barriers, and bridge parapets.
