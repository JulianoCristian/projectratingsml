It also seeks to create the institutional structures needed to promote industrial sector development. The line of credit to BCV would finance productive investments in small- and medium-scale industrial enterprises, including artisans and cooperatives. The technical assistance component would help set up and operate a new Investment Department within BCV and a new Industrial Promotion Unit within SEINE.
