The second component focuses on rehabilitating irrigation and drainage systems. The investments will be chosen by water users groups to be formed under the project. The third component provides lending for both working capital and investment expenditures by private farms and rural businesses. To be eligible for loans, borrowers must have completed legal procedures concerning privatization and restructuring (in the case of farms) or be private or privatized nonfarm enterprises. The fourth component supports credits to establish well-equipped private agro-service centers for machinery services and supply of agricultural inputs, which would create competition with the existing state-owned enteprises in the machinery services and input markets."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uzbekistan!$!UZ","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":38},"sector3":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"36,140,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Procurement Plan,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"UZ","sectorcode":"AB,BC,AH,AI,YB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Rural development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,43,41,77,33","mjthemecode":"3,10,4,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry","code":"YB"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":40},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":38},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20091201010021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20091201010021","DocDate":"01-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090602010527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090602010527","DocDate":"28-FEB-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333038_20080229040706","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080229040706","DocDate":"29-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200444549","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200444549","DocURL":"05-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01121204013820","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01121204013820","DocDate":"28-NOV-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929100452","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929100452","DocDate":"27-MAR-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uzbekistan"}},"facets":{}}
