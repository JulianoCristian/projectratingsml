This will be achieved by: 1) carrying out urgent expansion of the government communications network, to restore critical communications between ministries, and provinces; 2) providing urgently needed policy advice, and capacity building to the Ministry of Communications (MOC) to promote sustainable communications sector performance, and increased private sector participation; and, 3) improving the postal sector, and the delivery of postal services. The outcomes of the Project are expected to be improvements in communications facilities, and delivery, while laying the foundations for sector reforms, and institution building, which would lead to sustainable development of the communications sector. While benefits include improved government communications capacity, sector development, and reform, leading to greater communications access, and increased private investment, there are however risks, such as the technical and financial sustainability of government network (mitigated through design), but as well, general security, and institutional weaknesses."},"country_namecode":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan!$!AF","sector1":{"Name":"Telecommunications","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":23},"sector3":{"Name":"Information technology","Percent":10},"sector4":{"Name":"Postal services","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":24},"theme5":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"22,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Telecommunications"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Information technology"},{"Name":"Postal services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Technical Annex,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"AF","sectorcode":"CD,CA,BC,CT","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"},{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"34,39,40,25,30","mjthemecode":"2,2,4,4,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Telecommunications","code":"CT"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Information technology","code":"CA"},{"name":"Postal services","code":"CD"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":65},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":23},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":10},{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20101215041809","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20101215041809","DocDate":"30-MAR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202160801","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202160801","DocDate":"08-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202160801","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202160801","DocURL":"08-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Technical Annex (TAN),  Vol.1","DocType":"TAN","EntityID":"000012009_20030917101312","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030917101312","DocDate":"05-SEP-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20030813120413","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20030813120413","DocDate":"13-AUG-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20030721091828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20030721091828","DocDate":"18-JUL-2003"}],"countryname":"Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan"}},"facets":{}}
