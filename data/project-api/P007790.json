These objectives can be narrowed down more specifically to the following: 1) to establish a mechanism based on municipal governments and community organizations for reducing rural poverty through rural investment in economic infrastructure, improved natural resource management and small-scale communal productive activities; 2) to ensure that central government institutions acquire the capacity to provide a coherent overall framework for natural resource policy making and enforcement, accounting for global, national and regional environmental priorities; and 3) to promote the long-term integrity of a biological corridor along the Atlantic slope of Nicaragua, conserving key global biodiversity values. To meet these objectives, the project will have the following three components: 1) rural municipalities development, including institutional development, information, participation, training and grants; 2) natural resources policies and institutions involving institutional development and an inter-institutional technical assistance program; and 3) Atlantic biodiversity corridor (GEF), which will include land use and biodiversity planning, monitoring and evaluation and a financial mechanism to promote the sustainability of the corridor."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
