There are four project components. The first extends a further line of credit to be offered on commerical terms. The SEP II line of credit will draw extensively upon lessons learned during SEP I (See report no. 20206). Accordingly, the line of credit will be similar in style and function to that in SEP I but will incorporate adjustments to the delivery method, targeting, interest rate, and management processes. In addition to the agri-business sector, viable loan applications from other productive industries such as small-scale carpentry shops, mechanical centers or manufacturing facilities will also be supported. The second component finances business development services, civil service training, and the development of the business enabling environment. The third component funds sub-grants to 13 districts for market rehabilitation, specifically produce and goods market facilities. The fourth component finances consultant services, incremental operating costs, and project implementation unit (PIU) training, as well as other miscellaneous items for the PIU office."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!$!TP","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":15},"sector3":{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade","Percent":13},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":28},"theme3":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"7,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Other domestic and international trade"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"TP","sectorcode":"BC,YY,YZ,FE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"41,44,39,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Other domestic and international trade","code":"YY"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":67},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":15},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":13},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080808005438","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080808005438","DocDate":"08-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052614432254","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052614432254","DocDate":"29-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010050610552253","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010050610552253","DocDate":"29-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02010711081922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02010711081922","DocDate":"28-SEP-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00121302001955","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00121302001955","DocDate":"28-SEP-2001"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
