The project has the following four components: Component 1) Sub-component 1A is to improve the health system so that it can respond to medical aspects of the epidemic and prevent HIV transmission, particularly through safe blood transfusion and better bio-security in general. Sub-component 1B) The National Strategic Plan for the fight against HIV-AIDS also sets forth the response of ministries other than the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) which have under vulnerable groups and at-risk sectors under their jurisdiction. The project supports these ministries. Component 2) Will support efforts that emerge from civil society to prevent the spread and to reduce the impact of HIV-AIDS. These efforts may come from local institutions such as NGOs, community-based organizations including faith-based organizations and parent-teacher associations, as well as trade unions, and to a degree, the private sector. Component 3) HIV-AIDS, civil conflict, and the decline of the public health system all contributed to the emergence of a large and growing cohort of orphans and other extremely vulnerable children (OVC) in the Congo. This component addresses the OVC issue at a meaningful scale by investing in the health, education and overall well-being of these children. Component 4) Sub-component 4A) Will strengthens the capacity of the Congo to fight against HIV/AIDS by supporting the CNLS, and its Permanent Executive Secretariat. Sub-component 4B) Will supports capacity strengthening and training (and supply of related equipment and materials) in the CNLS and its Permanent Executive Secretariat, in Government ministries, and in civil society.
