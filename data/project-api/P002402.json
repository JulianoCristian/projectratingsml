It would comprise:  (a) an action program for rationalization of the institutional framework in the agricultural sector, including merger of ongoing integrated agricultural development projects with the reorganized Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR).  In addition, this project would enable privatization of Ministry operations in agricultural mechanization and palm oil processing, and improvements in operating systems in the MANR and in agricultural policy-making.  Furthermore, there would be:  (b)  significant reductions in numbers of unskilled support staff in MANR; (c) financing of improvements in operating facilities for MANR; (d) provision of foreign exchange to finance key imports for the sector; (e) support of tree crop and swamp development programs; and (f) technical assistance.  Provision of finance for imports would be linked to progress in the action program. Provision of imports principally fertilizers, spare parts and agricultural equipment, and support of swamp development and tree crop programs, would directly benefit about 80,000 farmers, most of whom have incomes close to the absolute poverty level.
