The project covers all capital investment in these fields in Ethiopia in the next 4-1/2 years. The estimated total cost of the project, including consultant fees and allowances for contingencies, is $11 million. The proposed credit of $7.2 million would cover all the estimated foreign exchange costs ($3.8 million) and roughly half the local expenditures, with the result that the Association would finance two-thirds of the project cost and the Government the remainder. The project would be completed by the end of 1970."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"7,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Transcript,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333037_20081127000529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20081127000529","DocDate":"05-FEB-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902523740","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902523740","DocDate":"28-FEB-1966"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228c1f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228c1f_1_0","DocDate":"16-FEB-1966"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081c3e816_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3e816_1_0","DocDate":"16-FEB-1966"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Transcript (Transcript),  Vol.1","DocType":"Transcript","EntityID":"000356161_20130621130109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130621130109","DocDate":"15-FEB-1966"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810190348341","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190348341","DocDate":"31-JAN-1966"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
