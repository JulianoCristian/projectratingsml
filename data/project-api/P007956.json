This ore will be treated in a new concentrator, increasing concentrate output from 50,000 STPY to 223,000 STPY containing 25 percent copper and 5.5 oz of silver per ton. Related administrative, industrial and social infrastructure are also included in the project. The existing concentrator will be dismantled, with some of the equipment to be used in the new concentrator, to be constructed on a more stable site. (b) the Cerro de Pasco Mine Water Treatment Plant: This project would improve the economics of copper recovery by replacing an existing cementation plant with a more efficient solvent extraction and electro-winning plant producing refined copper in place of cement copper, and eliminating CENTROMIN's pollution of the San Juan and Mantaro rivers. Production of copper would be 7,000 STPY by 1979."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"NN","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining","code":"NX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","code":"NN"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165236","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165236","DocDate":"25-OCT-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b835_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b835_1_0","DocDate":"03-JUN-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e7b82f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e7b82f_1_0","DocDate":"03-JUN-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902263272","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902263272","DocDate":"31-MAY-1976"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901521242","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901521242","DocDate":"31-MAY-1976"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru"}},"facets":{}}
