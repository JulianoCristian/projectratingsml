The project provides for the rehabilitation of the physical works for Jamaica's only sugar refinery and its three largest raw sugar factories and a technical assistance program to improve the efficiency of cane and sugar production. The physical works consist of a large number of individual jobs to replace and/or renovate worn-out or outmoded facilities, and improve efficiency. The technical assistance consists of studies leading to improvement in (a) cane harvesting, loading and quality assessment, and (b) factory operations, maintenance and management. The project also includes training elements."},"country_namecode":"Jamaica!$!JM","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"18,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"JM","sectorcode":"AM","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","code":"AM"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924214321","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924214321","DocDate":"30-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f51_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f51_1_0","DocDate":"07-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f4c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f4c_1_0","DocDate":"07-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f4b_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f4b_1_0","DocDate":"07-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902294264","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902294264","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912233184","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912233184","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"}],"countryname":"Jamaica"}},"facets":{}}
