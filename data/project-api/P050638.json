UP BEPII helps the government to a) establish the capacity to enroll all 6-10 year old children; b) establishes the capacity to enroll 75 percent of 11-13 year old children; and c) improves student learning achievement and completion rates. The project has two major components: 1) expanding access by opening about 600 primary and 300 upper primary schools, and constructing about 11,000 additional classrooms in the existing institutions; and 2) improving quality and retention, through appointing about 13,000 additional teachers; providing learning materials, including development of new materials for new schools; in-service training to new teachers; and establishing a school improvement fund."},"country_namecode":"Republic of India!$!IN","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"59,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"IN","sectorcode":"ET,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Human development"],"themecode":"65,78,59,57,71","mjthemecode":"9,7,7,10,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":95},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01052304253782","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01052304253782","DocDate":"12-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200585315","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200585315","DocURL":"03-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200585315","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200585315","DocDate":"03-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200585114","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200585114","DocURL":"03-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200585114","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200585114","DocDate":"03-MAR-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980203114853","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980203114853","DocDate":"27-OCT-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929094556","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929094556","DocDate":"10-OCT-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of India"}},"facets":{}}
