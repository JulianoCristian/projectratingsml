The project will be financed by both the Bank and by a loan of $8.75 million from the OPEC Special Fund (OSF), the latter providing all its funds to SSI projects; SSI financing under the Bank loan is estimated at about 10 percent of the loan proceeds, or about $4 million. At the request of OSF the Bank has agreed to administer the OSF loan.
