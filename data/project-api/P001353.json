The project will accomplish this objective through a set of policies for enabling the entrepreneurial environment and developing a national training strategy to improve the quality, access, and sustainable financing of relevant skill upgrading and technology for the informal sector, and a related investment program. The investment program includes: (a) a micro- and small enterprise training fund; (b) a technology information, innovation and research program and pilot infrastructure development; and (c) institutional development. The project will make provisions for increasing women's representation in manufacturing through skills training and technology development suitable for upgrading their enterprises or bringing them into the sector. The Ministry of Research, Technical Training and Technology will use private sector contractors, training and research institutions, the Jua Kali Federation and Associations and employers as the primary agents to promote and implement the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Kenya!$!KE","sector1":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":58},"sector2":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":28},"theme2":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"21,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KE","sectorcode":"BC,YZ,EV","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"41,59,40,39","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,4,7,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"},{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":58},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":25},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20050707130011","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050707130011","DocDate":"24-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030708133746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030708133746","DocDate":"24-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121203839","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121203839","DocURL":"25-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121203839","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121203839","DocDate":"25-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b608_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b608_1_0","DocDate":"05-APR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961005055237","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005055237","DocDate":"03-MAR-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005054954","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005054954","DocDate":"02-MAR-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Kenya","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
