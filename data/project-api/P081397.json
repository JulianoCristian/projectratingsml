Specifically, the program will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the National Environmental System (SINA), and, integrate principles of sustainable development into key sectors, with a particular emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable groups. The Program will improve environmental management, particularly in urban areas, and, will support the development of a results-based framework for planning and monitoring progress of the SINA, as well as improvements in inter-institutional coordination, and increased public participation in environmental decision-making. In addition, preparation of critical policies, and laws related to air quality, water quality, solid waste management, and environmental licensing will also be supported. Improvements in air and water quality in urban centers will lead to decreased morbidity, and mortality rates, and other health effects. Increased accountability, transparency and improved public participation will provide the most vulnerable groups a voice in environmental decision-making. Several risks have been identified, most important, the overall political context, namely the internal conflict and violence associated with illegal drug activity, which could negatively affect the fiscal and macroeconomic environment, while aggravating the social situation. Throughout the reform program, several actions are being undertaken to mitigate risks, that is, through complementary actions in other sectors to support the development of a stronger foundation for peace, and reforms, allowing resources to be used for the transition to a post-conflict Colombia."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Information Document,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"TZ,BH,WZ,JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,84,82","mjthemecode":"11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General water, sanitation and flood protection sector","code":"WZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":25},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":15},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20120517022109","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120517022109","DocDate":"29-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2005121210101617","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2005121210101617","DocDate":"13-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2005121210101617","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2005121210101617","DocURL":"13-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20050912152053","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050912152053","DocDate":"08-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20050603125304","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050603125304","DocDate":"20-MAY-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050504082753","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050504082753","DocDate":"21-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20040505094044","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040505094044","DocDate":"19-APR-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
