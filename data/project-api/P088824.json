The project includes two components: 1) The General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA) road maintenance and rehabilitation program; and, 2) implementation of GDDKiA management information system (MIS). The road maintenance and rehabilitation program has been prepared by GDDKiA within the framework of the 2005 budget. For the period beyond 2005 the proposed program is expected to be well balanced between maintenance-rehabilitation, strengthening and reconstruction of existing roads, together with new construction of motorways and expressways. Its financing will be from both, domestic and foreign sources. The second component - GDDKiA MIS - will support the implementation of a modem management and information system (MIS) within GDDKiA, that will properly integrate all data necessary to efficiently carry out its activities (including technical, financial, human resources, and contract related data) and support all core functions and decision-making processes within GDDKiA. This Component will include, but not be limited to: a) development of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), consisting of integrated modules such as planning, controlling, finances, fixed assets management, human resources management, and project management; b) development of a system workflow for the management of documents and information; and, c) procurement of any related system, supporting equipment, and hardware/software."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":96},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Regional integration","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"130,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Procurement Plan,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Human development"],"themecode":"89,39,47","mjthemecode":"5,4,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regional integration","code":"47"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":96},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000356161_20131224114722","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20131224114722","DocDate":"18-DEC-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20090813231931","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090813231931","DocDate":"24-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000020953_20080512105653","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20080512105653","DocDate":"07-NOV-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000012009_20060707103546","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060707103546","DocDate":"01-JUL-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000021321_2005082913584828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005082913584828","DocDate":"26-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2005082913584828","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2005082913584828","DocURL":"26-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000012009_20050311123548","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050311123548","DocDate":"04-MAR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20050131104745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050131104745","DocDate":"28-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000012009_20050405124000","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050405124000","DocDate":"01-JAN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20050124093959","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050124093959","DocDate":"22-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20041104103746","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20041104103746","DocDate":"04-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20041105094448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20041105094448","DocDate":"20-OCT-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland"}},"facets":{}}
