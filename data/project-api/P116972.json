This operation is being proposed as the first of a series of three sequential programmatic operations. The strategic vision of the PASS is to improve results in social sectors (mainly social protection, education and health), preserving in the short term, and enhancing in the medium term, the human capital of the poorest citizens. Consistent with this vision, the PASS has four inter-related objectives: (i) to enhance the performance of social sectors to promote human capital (health, nutrition, education) for the poorest citizens, through a fundamental redesign of the Government's Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) program, and its articulation with critical actions in health and education; (ii) to improve budget management to support the joint performance of the social sector within the CCT program, as part of the interim measures to protect critical aspects of social spending and support the required improvements in the supply of health, nutrition and education services; (iii) to support the gradual introduction of performance agreements in key social sector agencies; and (iv) to enhance transparency and oversight in social sectors. This document is structured as follows: (a) country context (section two); (b) government's program and operation rationale, discussing the outlook and policy challenges for enhancing the performance and accountability of social sectors, as well as the participatory processes that inform these challenges (section three); (c) brief description of Bank support to the Government program targeted by the PASS (section four); (d) the operation, overall approach and specific areas of policy actions (section five); and (e) implementation aspects, including poverty, social"},"country_namecode":"Dominican Republic!$!DO","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":39},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":33},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":28},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":36},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":21},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Document,Program Information Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"DO","sectorcode":"EZ,JA,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Human development","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"54,65,67,30","mjthemecode":"2,8,8,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":39},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":33},{"Name":"Education","Percent":28}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000452162_20130917155420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000452162_20130917155420","DocDate":"30-MAY-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011022619393110","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011022619393110","DocDate":"26-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010041914113493","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010041914113493","DocDate":"18-NOV-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000020953_20100513132906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20100513132906","DocDate":"20-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000350881_20091103110745","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20091103110745","DocDate":"20-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000101930_20091013101756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000101930_20091013101756","DocDate":"02-SEP-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000334955_20090714044226","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090714044226","DocDate":"16-JUN-2009"}],"countryname":"Dominican Republic"}},"facets":{}}
