The system will have 14 stations spaced approximately every 2 kms, and will have a capacity of 48,000 passengers per hour in each direction. The benefits of the project will mainly accrue to the urban poor, many of whom live on the periphery of the metropolitan area, providing them with more rapid access to employment centers and improving the urban environment in which they live. The project will save on vehicle operating costs including fuel, reduce travel time, and reduce air and noise pollution by achieving a more efficient modal distribution of traffic and use of all transport facilities in the area of influence of the railway. It will contribute to the development of selected employment growth poles along the north-south corridor. The project involves the establishment of the company, TRENSURB, which was recently created to own and operate the system on a commercial basis without government operating subsidies."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban transport","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"159,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban transport"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"TU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban transport","code":"TU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007200357","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007200357","DocDate":"16-DEC-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924231332","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924231332","DocDate":"24-DEC-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e96189_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96189_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e96187_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e96187_1_0","DocDate":"06-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902350687","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902350687","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912481433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912481433","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
