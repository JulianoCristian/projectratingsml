The project will comprise: bridge and road rehabilitation works to be contracted out; periodic and routine maintenance works to be carried out by local firms, and local communities and the Ministry of Public Works' (MTPTC) force account; limited procurement of traffic control and road maintenance equipment and tools; and an institutional strengthening component. This last component will be aimed at: 1) restructuring the MTPTC; 2) improving transport planning and sector policy; 3) training MTPTC staff to prepare projects for private sector implementation and to manage contracts; and 4) preparing studies aimed at resolving sector/sub-sector issues."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Haiti!$!HT","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":90},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HT","sectorcode":"BC,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"39,44","mjthemecode":"4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":90},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02100904011140","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02100904011140","DocDate":"26-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122035032","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122035032","DocURL":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122035032","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122035032","DocDate":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122034831","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122034831","DocDate":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122034229","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122034229","DocURL":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122034530","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122034530","DocURL":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122034831","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122034831","DocURL":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122035433","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122035433","DocURL":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122035433","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122035433","DocDate":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122034229","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122034229","DocDate":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122034530","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122034530","DocDate":"14-APR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b49c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b49c_1_0","DocDate":"23-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970311121044","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970311121044","DocDate":"28-FEB-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007213317","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007213317","DocDate":"28-FEB-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Haiti"}},"facets":{}}
