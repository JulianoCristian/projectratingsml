The project will enable YAR to better use its highly valuable but largely underexploited fish and shrimp resources by introducing the infrastructure and technology needed to improve the production and marketing in the fisheries sector, thus increasing the income and improving the economic well-being of YAR's artisanal fishermen and reducing YAR's increasing dependence on imported animal protein. The main project components include: (a) construction of an artisanal fishing port and related facilities in Hodeidah, the center of YAR's fishing industry; (b) Construction of an artisanal landing pier and related facilities at Khawbah. (c) construction of fish handling, marketing and storage facilities; (d) construction of a 32 km road to link Khawbah with the new section of YAR's main highway; (e) provision of credit facilities for fishing vessels, equipment and transport vehicles; and (f) provision of technical assistance and training."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"17,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"RY","sectorcode":"AF","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Fisheries and aquaculture","code":"AF"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e041d0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e041d0_1_0","DocDate":"20-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190235208","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190235208","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912490227","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912490227","DocDate":"30-APR-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Yemen"}},"facets":{}}
