The proposed project will build and expand on a community-based approach to natural resource management. The project has five components.   Component 1: Rehabilitation of degraded natural resources The component's primary objective is to protect degraded areas from further degradation, erosion and pollution. Rehabilitation interventions are focused around four sub-components 1) The main sub-components are as follows: 1) Rehabilitation of forest land including soil conservation by afforestation, protection and improvement of  poor & degraded soils, gallery plantation, rehabilitation of  oak coppices and of  degraded high forests, participatory replanting and inventory of non-wood forest products; 2) Rangeland rehabilitation, including improved management of  forest rangelands and rehabilitation activities on rangeland outside the forest land; 3) Rehabilitation of agricultural land, including: fallow reduction, appropriate use of  marginal agricultural land, wild tree grafting, river bank protection, and construction and production on agricultural terraces; and  4) Environment-friendly agricultural practices, including demonstrations of  improved crop production practices, organic farming and integrated pest management and nutrient reduction activities implemented. Component 2 supports Income generating activities designed to provide participating communities with the incentives to undertake conservation efforts.
