The restructuring will also include: (i) dropping a planned activity under AISP AF, and (ii) eliminating/revising the corresponding intermediate outcome indicators, and (iii) reallocating the associated funds. Due to the emergency nature of the additional financing for the new AISP food security component, the identification of activities and preparation of the accompanying documents had to be carried out and discussed under very tight time constraints. The main objective at that time was to respond as quickly as possible to the crisis of surging food prices. But as the food crisis subsided and project implementation progressed, it has become evident that some restructuring of the project is required. In particular, there is no need to continue supporting community grain storages under the food security component (component four), as maintenance of storage infrastructure is the responsibility of private mills. It is, therefore, proposed to drop this activity, eliminate a corresponding monitoring indicator and re-allocate the remaining funds from this subcomponent for other priority project activities. In addition, since the project can not affect the price volatility with the available SDR 2.5 million, it is to revise the intermediate outcome and indicator associated with this activity. Finally, it is to revise the PDO to align it with all project legal documents."},"country_namecode":"Kyrgyz Republic!$!KG","sector1":{"Name":"Animal
