The project is the first attempt to test the conclusions of the National Watershed Management Study carried out to take stock of past experiences in watershed management and apply the lessons learned. There are three components. The first consists of soil and water conservation and erosion control measures carried out with the active participation of the communities concerned on public, collective, and private lands. These measures include 1) protecting gullies and ravines on all lands, improving range lands in degraded sylvopastoral lands, and revegetating badlands progressively; 2) funding participative forest management with pilot operations to regularize illicit settlements, reforesting, and improving socio-economic infrastructure; 3) rehabilitating small-scale irrigation systems; and 4) intensifying irrigated and rain-fed crop production, planting fruit trees, and sponsoring field demonstrations and farmers' days. The second component, socio-economic infrastructure, finances access roads, water supply schemes, and technical studies. The third component finances four-wheel drive vehicles, office furniture and equipment including computer equipment, and a training program for project staff, elected representatives, and local administration officials."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Morocco!$!MA","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":64},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":11},"theme5":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"4,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"MA","sectorcode":"BC,TA,WC,BH,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance","Rural development"],"themecode":"79,26,83,85,57","mjthemecode":"7,11,11,2,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":64},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":11},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":11},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000333038_20090728004041","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090728004041","DocDate":"01-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20050630093641","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20050630093641","DocDate":"17-JUN-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010040809493249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010040809493249","DocDate":"29-SEP-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99031910514280","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99031910514280","DocDate":"03-DEC-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929094933","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929094933","DocDate":"30-NOV-1997"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Morocco"}},"facets":{}}
