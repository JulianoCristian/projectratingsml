It would assist the Democratic Republic of Congo in its economic and social recovery, in the context of the Government's 2004-2005 Reform, Growth, and Poverty Reduction Programs. Proceeds of the proposed credit would provide funds necessary to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo with foreign exchange needs.  The Credit will support policies that stabilize the economy and pave the way to environmentally and socially sustainable growth and poverty reduction through a number of interventions. The primary risks-and associated mitigating measures-are (i) renewed internal and or regional conflict, which is reduced by UN intervention and by a Bank-led multinational regional demobilization and reintegration program; (ii) the DRC's accruing new arrears on external debt because of the increased debt service burden in the short run, even though the overall debt burden in net present value terms has been reduced greatly; (iii) the DRC losing international financial support, with consequences in the country's ability to service debt as well as in financing necessary spending on social and economic rehabilitation, which is mitigated by the International Development Association (IDA's) working with other donors to assure a continued high level of donor financing and providing guidance for the measures, including the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process, that will make permanent the debt service reduction that followed the HIPC Decision Point; (iv) insufficient institutional capacity, which is being addressed by technical assistance and capacity-reinforcing activit"},"country_namecode":"Democratic Republic of the Congo!$!ZR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Banking","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":23},"theme5":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Banking"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Tranche Release Document,Tranche Release Document,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"ZR","sectorcode":"JB,YZ,FA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Economic management","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"25,27,40,21,42","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,1,4,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Banking","code":"FA"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"},{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000350881_20120321112901","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20120321112901","DocDate":"21-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060724140412","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060724140412","DocDate":"28-JUN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000112742_20050825101823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20050825101823","DocDate":"25-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Tranche Release Document (TRD),  Vol.1","DocType":"TRD","EntityID":"000012009_20041117162921","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041117162921","DocDate":"17-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031116094146","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031116094146","DocDate":"09-MAR-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20040205145306","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040205145306","DocDate":"30-JAN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000160016_20040121145700","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040121145700","DocDate":"16-JAN-2004"}],"countryname":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
