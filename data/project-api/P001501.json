It thus constitutes the first phase of a long-term program to rehabilitate approximately 116 such medium-size irrigation schemes. It will develop new institutions for local administration to assist the farmers to organize and finance the maintenance of the schemes rehabilitated after project completion. In addition the project will provide for the rehabilitation and improved management of one large scale irrigation scheme. The project includes: (a) strengthening of existing institutions to select, organize and supervise the rehabilitation of priority irrigation schemes; (b) rehabilitation in the first phase (covering six years) of 165 medium irrigation schemes covering about 17,000 ha.; (c) rehabilitation of the large scale SAMANGOKY cotton and rice scheme."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Madagascar!$!MG","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MG","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019121523","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019121523","DocDate":"26-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e06176_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e06176_1_0","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e06174_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e06174_1_0","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970702135904","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970702135904","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101403","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101403","DocDate":"30-APR-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Madagascar"}},"facets":{}}
