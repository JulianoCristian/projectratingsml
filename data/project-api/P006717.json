In addition, four substations will be constructed with the appropriate auxiliary equipment at locations suitable for linking up with the four regional power systems. Also included in the project is a study by a qualified expert of accounting and pricing methods to assure a satisfactory pricing system for the sale of power. The statutes of the Interconexion will be appropriately modified on the basis of such study. In addition, the project will include funds for engineering studies of future investments in transmission and generating facilities of the interconnected system."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"18,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"PD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","code":"PD"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903094448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903094448","DocDate":"30-NOV-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67b73_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67b73_1_0","DocDate":"26-NOV-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67b72_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67b72_1_0","DocDate":"26-NOV-1968"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e67b71_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67b71_1_0","DocDate":"26-NOV-1968"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
