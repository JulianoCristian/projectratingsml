The existing road is inadequate for the present traffic amounting to about 300 vehicles per day, of which about 80 are heavy trucks. The road provides the transport for commuters and supplies to the CPC potash mine and refinery at St. Paul, and to the adjoining town of Makola where the mine workers live.
