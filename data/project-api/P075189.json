There are four project components. The first component provides school improvement grants to 650 basic schools and 50 general secondary schools to support training, technical assistance, and outreach and evaluation costs. The second component sets internationally recognized standards, establishes a modern and internationally recognized system for assessment and examinations, and establishes and develops a sustainable Education and Assessment Service for Serbia (ESAS). Specifically, the component finances training and study visits for key specialist and administrative/logistical ESAS staff; equipment, software, materials, and books; develops and field-tests standards-linked external assessment instruments; and covers national costs, technical assistance, and recurrent costs. The third component promotes effective management of educational resources and monitoring of performance by improving the educational information and financing systems. The fourth component funds educational decentralization; it strengthens governance and management capacity in primary and secondary schools."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Serbia!$!YF","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":32},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":32},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":18},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":18},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"YF","sectorcode":"BH,BC,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,65,26,57","mjthemecode":"7,2,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":32},{"Name":"Education","Percent":32},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":18},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":18}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080411013107","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080411013107","DocDate":"28-JAN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201290164","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201290164","DocDate":"14-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201290164","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201290164","DocURL":"14-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02041104064747","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02041104064747","DocDate":"27-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01112204241540","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01112204241540","DocDate":"22-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_01113004005828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01113004005828","DocDate":"28-NOV-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Serbia"}},"facets":{}}
