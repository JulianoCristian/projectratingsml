The project will provide primarily for: (i) the installation of 67,500 lines of semi-automatic exchange equipment in small towns; (ii) the rehabilitation and re-installation of about 60,000 lines of manual exchanges in rural areas; (iii) the replacement and expansion of outside plant networks for about 180,000 lines; and (iv) the rehabilitation and expansion of long distance networks. In addition the project will help strengthen ARENTO's organization and financial position. Project benefits include direct support for development in rural areas, with more timely availability of inputs and improved marketing and social services."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"64,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics"}],"docty":"Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"CC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Information and communications","code":"CX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","code":"CC"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Information and communications","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912531562","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912531562","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902380958","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902380958","DocDate":"30-JUN-1981"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
