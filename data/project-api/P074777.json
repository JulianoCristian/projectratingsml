To this end, project components will: 1) address institutional strengthening of the MPAS/SPS, in particular the Department of Public Social Security Systems (DEPSP), required to manage the project, and carry out its mandate of monitoring, evaluating, and providing TA to sub-national governments. TA will be provided through a core group of consultants in information technology, actuarial science, and pension legislation, which will be retained at DEPSP to supplement MPAS staff, and service municipalities during project implementation. A financial management specialist will provide project management support to administer the program, with an additional TA support for municipal logistics, including staff training. Institutional studies will be undertaken on pension fund asset management, and, for the evaluation and strategy assistance on municipal pension systems; and, 2) upgrade municipal pension management, and provide hardware/software, and related training to municipalities. Consulting services will be provided to upgrade municipal cadastre, through an actuarial analysis, and development of pension reform systems. Municipal dissemination, and workshops should enhance stakeholder participation on pension issues, and best practices to strengthen reform constituencies."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Pr\u00e9stamo para asistencia t\u00e9cnica para pensiones municipales</ProjectName></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":34},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"BE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Economic management","Urban development"],"themecode":"72,24,27","mjthemecode":"2,1,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20100921011815","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100921011815","DocDate":"10-MAY-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1","DocType":"PROP","EntityID":"000333037_20090810021738","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090810021738","DocDate":"01-AUG-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201505397","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201505397","DocURL":"16-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201505397","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201505397","DocDate":"16-OCT-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02071104013783","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071104013783","DocDate":"25-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02031404021629","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02031404021629","DocDate":"06-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_01122104025910","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01122104025910","DocDate":"06-DEC-2001"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
