The project has three components. The first component designs and implements an interactive learning center (ILC) as a non-formal educational facility focused on the social, scientific, and environmental requirements for sustainable development, to be used by children, teachers, and parents. The project emphasizes the pre-Hispanic contribution, specifically research on the practices and scientific knowledge of pre-Hispanic cultures; trains local residents, including indigenous residents, as guides for the COPAN park (a park of archeological ruins); and develops a conceptual framework for interactive archeological exhibits and workshops for children at the COPAN park. This component also consists of archeological parks subprojects. The second component supports capacity building for the staff and volunteers of the ILC and the development of an ILC communication strategy. The third component designs and implements a management plan for archeological parks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","Percent":84},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":16},"theme1":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"8,300,000","sector":[{"Name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"JB,EL","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Human development"],"themecode":"66,86,80","mjthemecode":"11,11,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Adult literacy/non-formal education","code":"EL"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":84},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":16}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20060501091112","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060501091112","DocDate":"26-APR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201074162","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201074162","DocURL":"29-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201074263","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201074263","DocURL":"29-JUN-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99061205322590","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99061205322590","DocDate":"31-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_99061605525720","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99061605525720","DocDate":"25-MAY-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras"}},"facets":{}}
