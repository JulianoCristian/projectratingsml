The changes include: triggering of a new safeguard, (involuntary resettlement) for all three components; ceasing loan financing for infrastructure works in the Baneasa area, and reallocating remaining funds to other areas of Bucharest where the impact is expected to be higher; revising the end-of-project outcome targets to reflect the reallocation and increased civil works costs in Bucharest; aligning the project agreement covenant on selecting the operator in Arad with current legislation; reducing the number of counties in component three from 11 to 10 and modifying the project development objective and end-of-project outcome targets accordingly; and introducing additional indicators and clarified measures to the results framework. The changes will mitigate risks to not achieving the project's development objective, and introduce adjustments necessary to ensure compliance with the loan and project agreements without significantly modifying project outcomes."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Urban Transport","Percent":39},"sector2":{"Name":"Flood
