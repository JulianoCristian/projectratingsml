The objectives of the project are to: develop policy to consolidate basic social insurance and social assistance programs reform; strengthen institutions responsible for planning and management of cash benefits; and strengthen training, research and statistical institutions to support social policy formation and implementation. Albania's transition from a command economy towards a market economy started with a less developed social safety net than other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Currently, the most pressing social problems involve price increases after liberalization, fall in real wages, and unemployment growth after employment guarantees were withdrawn. The government is attempting to restructure the social safety net and bring social policies in line with a decentralized democratic society and a transitional economy. The proposed project is poverty related and comprises two components: social insurance reform and social assistance development. The social assistance component will concentrate on organizing a system of income support. The social insurance component will contribute to poverty reduction by safeguarding the minimum benefits of those in the social insurance scheme."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":65},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":35},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"5,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AL","sectorcode":"BC,BE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"55,87,61,54,51","mjthemecode":"6,6,7,6,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship","code":"87"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":65},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":35}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00040502414014","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00040502414014","DocDate":"24-FEB-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123321809","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123321809","DocURL":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123321910","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123321910","DocDate":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123321809","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123321809","DocDate":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123321910","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123321910","DocURL":"30-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b2e3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b2e3_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e1b56a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e1b56a_1_0","DocDate":"14-SEP-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961005045602","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961005045602","DocDate":"18-AUG-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Albania"}},"facets":{}}
