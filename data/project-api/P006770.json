In addition to increasing the supply of renewable energy, the Guavio Hydro Power Project will provide 15% of the electricity needed in Colombia by 1988, a substantial part of which will be for the city of Bogota, and its environs. The project consists of: (a) river diversion, dam and spillway tunnels; (b) intake and diversion of the Chivor and Batatas Rivers into the Guavio reservoir; (c) pressure tunnel, underground powerhouse and transformer caverns, and tailrace tunnel; and (d) a 230 kV step-up substation at the site, two double-circuit 230 kV transmission lines to Bogota, and four 230 kV line bays at the Bogota 230 kV ring. The project further includes construction of EEEB's load dispatch and telecommunications center, which will function as a regional satellite of the national dispatch center under constrution by ISA. Also included is a study to assist in adequately protecting the environment of the Guavio River, and a training program. In connection with the project, a substantial part of the sector will be reorganized to improve its overall viability and efficiency."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"359,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"PP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment","code":"PP"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961214141757","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961214141757","DocDate":"22-MAY-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912540543","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912540543","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190237468","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190237468","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e97307_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97307_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e97306_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97306_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e97305_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97305_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAY-1981"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
