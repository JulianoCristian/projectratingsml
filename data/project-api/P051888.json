There are eight project components. 1) Improvement and expansion of water source will improve the existing nine irrigation areas and develop some tracts of land. 2) Improvement of major distribution system will support repair and completion of concrete panels or masonry lining in main and branch canals. 3) The component will support rehabilitation of pumping stations in six irrigation districts (IDs). 4) This component will improve the existing minor canals, drains, and on-farm development works on partially irrigated land, and expand new systems to land that currently has no irrigation distribution network at the lateral level. 5) Improvement of operation and maintenance will improve access roads to key infrastructure works and renovate management stations and research facilities. 6) Training, study tours, and technical assistance will improve the knowledge and understanding of resources. 6) Project management arrangements will ensure good coordination between government bureaus and irrigation districts associated with project implementation. 7) This component will supervise IDs in finalizing the designs for the canal improvement works. 8) The component will facilitate land acquisition to accommodate enlarged storage facilities and relocate the people affected.
