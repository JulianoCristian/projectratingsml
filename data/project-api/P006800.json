Major benefits are expected from value added to agricultural production and lower rural transport costs. Direct beneficiaries would be: (i) small farmers, for whom access to markets would be improved and modernized; and (ii) the isolated communities in the Pacific coastal region, for which small scale water transportation would be made safer and cost effective."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other transportation","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"62,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other transportation"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"TY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other transportation","code":"TY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007022639","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007022639","DocDate":"17-AUG-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625094345","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625094345","DocDate":"28-FEB-1986"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970701165339","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970701165339","DocDate":"28-FEB-1986"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
