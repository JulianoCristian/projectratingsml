The closing date for the project will be extended from December 31, 2011 until March 31, 2012. At the end of March 2011, a closing date extension from March 31, 2011 to December 31, 2011 was approved to allow time for the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GoMP) to work towards improved project implementation and to review all possible options for the Bank to continue assisting with the reform of the irrigation sector in Madhya Pradesh. The performance of the project has improved further during the last nine months and a positive momentum can be observed in the field, with significant progress made on a number of fronts. However, none of the project components has advanced sufficiently to be fully completed by the current loan closing date. There have been extensive discussions between GoMP and the Bank on the vision for reform of the water and irrigation sectors. Based on this, GoMP has prepared a comprehensive proposal for restructuring including extension of loan closing date extension up to December 31, 2014 and has sent this for consideration to the Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR) and the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA). As these are new procedures, the review of the restructuring proposal is expected to take additional time. DEA has indicated that the restructuring proposal will be sent to the Bank within the next few weeks, so that processing can be completed before March 31, 2012."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
