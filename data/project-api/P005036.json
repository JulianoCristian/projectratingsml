In addition, condensate recovered from the gas would release exportable crude oil. The resultant foreign exchange earnings from increased exports and savings from reduced imports would be substantial. The gas would be produced at Abu Qir and supplied to industrial users in the Alexandria area. The project would consist of: (i) a production platform with 9 wells, a utility platform, ancillary facilities, and 2 submarine pipelines; (ii) gas separation, gas dehydration and condensate recovery facilities, a slug catcher, an LPG plant, a flare system and supply and distribution pipelines onshore; and (iii) technical assistance, training, a seismic survey, and project related studies."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"90,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"GI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","code":"GX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","code":"GI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902390979","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902390979","DocDate":"31-MAR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e97760_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e97760_1_0","DocDate":"23-MAR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9775e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9775e_1_0","DocDate":"23-MAR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e9775d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9775d_1_0","DocDate":"23-MAR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191254447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191254447","DocDate":"19-FEB-1982"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
