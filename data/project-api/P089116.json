The overall programmatic DPCL program aims to support sustainable economic growth and employment creation in Serbia. This project aims to support the Government of Serbia's actions in two broad areas: (1) strengthening the fiscal discipline in enterprise, energy and transport sectors, and attracting foreign direct investment; and (2) building a more efficient and stable financial sector and improving access to finance. Project aims will be achieved through government reforms as summarized in two pillars: Strengthening fiscal discipline, that is, reducing the Ministry of Economy's subsidy program and strengthening the Transition Fund mechanisms for displaced workers; privatizing, restructuring and bankruptcy of socially-owned enterprises; strengthening the legal framework for mining concessions; agreeing upon a time-bound process for the interim restructuring of  Serbia's national electric power utility; and beginning to rationalize the railway sector in accord with a time-bound plan. Second, building a more efficient and stable financial sector, specifically,  privatizing state-owned banks and divesting financial assets; strengthening the insurance sector regulation and resolution regime; the National Bank of Serbia's addressing banking sector supervision, regulation and resolutions; and improving access to finance by adopting a mortgage law."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Serbia!$!YF","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":44},"sector2":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":44},"sector3":{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","Percent":4},"sector4":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":4},"sector5":{"Name":"Railways","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"International financial standards and systems","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"55,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"},{"Name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries"},{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"},{"Name":"Railways"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Information Document,Program Information Document,Program Document","countrycode":"YF","sectorcode":"TW,LT,LS,FZ,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"42,40,43,34","mjthemecode":"3,4,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"},{"name":"Other Mining and Extractive Industries","code":"LS"},{"name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","code":"LT"},{"name":"Railways","code":"TW"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"International financial standards and systems","code":"42"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":44},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":44},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":4},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":4},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080806010108","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080806010108","DocDate":"26-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"006499507_2006021615065807","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006499507_2006021615065807","DocDate":"08-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"006499507_2006021615065807","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=006499507_2006021615065807","DocURL":"08-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20051004133440","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20051004133440","DocDate":"03-AUG-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20050413125137","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20050413125137","DocDate":"01-APR-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20051114132328","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051114132328","DocDate":"31-JAN-2005"}],"countryname":"Republic of Serbia"}},"facets":{}}
