The program supports the authorities' public expenditure reform efforts, with blended loans and credits. The first loan and credit will be for an amount equivalent to US$111 million, of which US$66 million is International Development Association (IDA) credit and US$45 million is International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan. The IDA credit and IBRD loan will be on-lent by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of BH to each entity by way of subsidiary loan agreements (for the IBRD loan) and subsidiary financing agreements (for the IDA credit) and the signing of which will constitute additional effectiveness conditions. The DPL supports the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) including the goals of: a) reducing the burden of Government on the economy and strengthening fiscal coordination; and b) improving the targeting of social benefits, both of which have taken on greater importance in the context of the unfolding global economic crisis."},"country_namecode":"Bosnia and Herzegovina!$!BA","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":50},"theme1":{"Name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"111,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Financing Agreement,Minutes,Program Document","countrycode":"BA","sectorcode":"BZ,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"27,54,21","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"1,6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability","code":"21"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2010122908553953","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2010122908553953","DocDate":"29-DEC-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010101817051220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010101817051220","DocDate":"03-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.","DocType":"FIA","EntityID":"000014464_2010101817065621","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010101817065621","DocDate":"03-JUN-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Minutes (MIN),  Vol.1","DocType":"MIN","EntityID":"000112742_20100428170802","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20100428170802","DocDate":"08-APR-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20100321234557","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100321234557","DocDate":"06-APR-2010"}],"countryname":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
