These objectives will be achieved by supporting reform of the Government's labor regulations, and improved training schemes; by enforcing legislation, amending the regulations on the decentralization of education and health services, while introducing incentives to enhance, and measure quality. In addition, an integrated, and more efficient social protection system will be developed, and, institutions for regular impact evaluation, and public oversight of social protection programs will be established. The project will specifically focus on: greater labor demand via employer incentives, and reductions in legal barriers to employment; increased coverage, efficiency, and targeting of social protection programs; quality and coverage improvements in the education sector; and, impact evaluation and social oversight of major social programs. Notwithstanding, several risks were identified: the overall political context, namely the internal conflict, and violence associated with illegal drug activity, the fiscal pressures, external economic and political shocks, opposition by special interest groups, the financial viability of the health reform, and, the sustainability of reforms that incur costs in the short-run. However, throughout the reform process, several actions are being undertaken to mitigate these risks, that is, both the Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loans, studies, and technical assistance support the health sector reform, and, provide further support via projects, technical assistance, and studies to measure the impacts of social programs, promote the result for better program design and management, and disseminate "},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":23},"theme5":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Secondary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"ES,JB,EP,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"66,51,56,54,65","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,6,6,6,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":40},{"Name":"Education","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080422005147","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080422005147","DocDate":"21-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20051003092002","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051003092002","DocDate":"30-SEP-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"005318172_2005011412334872","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005318172_2005011412334872","DocURL":"04-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"005318172_2005011412334872","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=005318172_2005011412334872","DocDate":"04-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20041015100132","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041015100132","DocDate":"06-OCT-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000012009_20040728134209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040728134209","DocDate":"09-JUN-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
