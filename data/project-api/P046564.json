The project empowers poor households in the selected poor counties to raise their incomes, through increased grain and livestock production sufficient to meet the basic needs of food and clothing and, in many cases, also generate a marketable surplus to improve living standards. The project has eight components. The first supports land and household development by providing improved agricultural and livestock technology packages--seeds, fertilizer, insecticides, plastic mulches, breeding/fattening stock; developing forests; and upgrading agricultural and livestock support services. The second component improves irrigation and land by building a new dam, renovating an existing dam, and constructing irrigation and drainage systems. The other six components 1) improve rural roads, build drinking water supply facilities, and extend electric power lines; 2) provide credit to establish non-state owned and household-based rural enterprises; 3) organize and place on a voluntary basis surplus rural laborers in off-farm employment; 4) support voluntary placement of some of the absolute poor living in mountains and local herders and farmers; 5) construct and upgrade basic education and health facilities; and 6) fund institution building and project management.
