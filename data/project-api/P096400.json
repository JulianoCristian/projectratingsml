The project has the following components: Component 1) entails construction of new GIS substations and a new 380 kV underground cable to strengthen the transmission networks in Istanbul and Izmir. The new GIS substations and underground cable will increase the capacity of the transmission networks in the cities and are necessary to meet the new and growing electricity demand in their local areas. Component 2) involves construction of underground cables to replace existing 154 kV overhead transmission lines in densely populated areas of Istanbul and Izmir. The 154 kV overhead transmission lines proposed for replacement with underground cables have been enveloped in rapid, uncontrolled urban expansion with sections of the lines virtually passing over roofs of houses and with right-of-ways entirely lost to encroachment by streets and buildings."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Turkey!$!TR","sector1":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of
