The project consists of the following components: 1) civil works which include a composite gravity concrete and rockfilled dam, an intake structure, a pipeline, a surge chamber, a tailrace, a powerhouse, and a switchyard.  Further to this, the project entails 2) the installation of electrical and mechanical equipment which includes a 4 MW turbine generator, auxiliary equipment, a set up transformer, and switchgear; 3) the construction of 23 km of 22 kV tranmission line, and upgrading of a 28 km section of a transmission line from 22 kV to 33 kV.  Finally, the project involves 4) provisions for consulting services for detailed engineering and construction supervision. The project's overall objectives are to support the energy policy Government of Western Samoa of developing indigenous renewable energy resources for generating electricity at an economic cost to displace h electricity generated by burning imported diesel at Upolu's diesel pow station which consumes expensive imported spare parts and consumables. output of the project will supplement electricity generated by run-of-the-river hydrostations during the dry season, when output from is reduced due to low stream flows, requiring diesel generation to mee electricity demand.  The project, which is currently under constructio about 65% complete, is located in the Upper Salani Basin some 26 km so of Apia.  Afulilo will be the first hydroelectric development in Upolu provide over-season storage and will substantially increase hydro ener firm capacity during the dry season.  The project involves constructio 20 meter high dam, together with a tunnel headrace and penstock to con water to a power station with two 2 MW turbine generators"},"country_namecode":"Samoa!$!WS","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"3,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,President's Report,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"WS","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019191930","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019191930","DocDate":"29-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"President's Report (PR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004075024","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004075024","DocDate":"30-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121465426","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121465426","DocURL":"18-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121465627","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121465627","DocDate":"18-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121465426","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121465426","DocDate":"18-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121465627","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121465627","DocURL":"18-JUN-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e3688a_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3688a_1_0","DocDate":"21-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e36889_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36889_1_0","DocDate":"21-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36887_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36887_1_0","DocDate":"21-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e36886_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e36886_1_0","DocDate":"21-APR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625091956","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625091956","DocDate":"31-MAR-1987"}],"countryname":"Samoa"}},"facets":{}}
