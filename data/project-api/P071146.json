The primary purpose of this reallocation is to assist the (National Committee for Democratic Development at Sub-national Level) NCDD-Secretariat to ensure that the RILGP is completed as planned under established implementing arrangements. The RILGP-AF project paper (2007) had covered this eventuality, including an allocation of US$450,000 that could be used to support Project to Support Democratic Development (PSDD) Technical Assistance (TA) if it was affected by a reduction in donor support. As this situation has now materialized we are seeking to utilize this allocation and to reallocate from other categories to cover the agreed Bank portion ($1.1million) of the shortfall. The reallocation to cover the PSDD shortfall will fund the TA contract with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for provincial advisory services (of approximately $1.1 million) and the ancillary costs for workshops and equipment. The reallocation affects all categories, and all are in accordance with the approved annual work plan and budget."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Cambodia!$!KH","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national
