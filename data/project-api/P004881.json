An important aspect of the proposed loan of US$40 million are the arrangements for technical assistance intended to upgrade the project appraisal and supervision capabilities of Banque Algerienne de Developpement (BAD), the borrower and administrator of the loan. Although this first loan to BAD will be confined essentially to the financing of construction materials industries, the Algerian authorities expect that, over time, the experience acquired by BAD's unit in appraising and supervising a number of medium-sized projects will set a pattern for BAD in most of its future operations, whatever their nature and sources of funding. Progress should gradually enable BAD to assume a stronger role in the Algerian investment-decision process. Whether this approach will work, particularly whether BAD's new working tools will carry weight is the essential risk in this operation which has considerable attributes of an experiment in the Algerian context."},"country_namecode":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria!$!DZ","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"DZ","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902244157","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902244157","DocDate":"30-JUN-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e723d8_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e723d8_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUN-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e723d7_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e723d7_1_0","DocDate":"26-JUN-1975"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333037_20100210024017","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20100210024017","DocDate":"10-JUN-1975"}],"countryname":"People's Democratic Republic of Algeria"}},"facets":{}}
