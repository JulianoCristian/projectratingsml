The project would contribute to the greater security, productivity, and income of individual occupiers of land through the provision of proof and title. It would pursue these aims by strengthening DOL's capability to carry out cadastral surveys systematically over areas not presently surveyed and to improve the quality of its service to the public in regard to resurvey, registration, issuance of title deeds and general administration of land through a major equipment, building, and training program. It would also support the development of a recently established national land valuation authority. The project would directly benefit some 700,000 landholding families in the North and Northeast, as well as the country as a whole through the compilation of a rationalized cadastre which can better serve as a public planning and management tool."},"country_namecode":"Kingdom of Thailand!$!TH","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other agriculture","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"35,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other agriculture"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"TH","sectorcode":"AY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other agriculture","code":"AY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925180627","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925180627","DocDate":"21-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99ace_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99ace_1_0","DocDate":"12-JUN-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902444432","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902444432","DocDate":"31-MAY-1984"}],"countryname":"Kingdom of Thailand"}},"facets":{}}
