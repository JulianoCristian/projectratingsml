The project closing date is extended by 8 months from July 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012. The extension of the closing date is to allow the time needed to sign a contract for a detailed design contract currently under procurement. If the contract is signed during this time, the closing date will be further extended by 18 months to September 30, 2013 to facilitate implementation of the consultant's work. On January 25, 2011, the district of Bogota requested an 18 month extension of the closing date of the additional loan to January 31, 2013. Later, on May 12, 2011 the district extended his request for two years, to July 31, 2013. The Borrower has requested this extension to compensate for delays that have occurred due to additional technical discussions between the district and the national government related to the alignment of the first metro line which resulted in additional analytical work on the transport demand model in order for the Government of Colombia (GoC) to endorse proceeding with the engineering design. The extension will adequately compensate for the compounded delays that affected the processing of the pending consultant contracts, which was beyond the implementing agency's control."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de servicios urbanos en
