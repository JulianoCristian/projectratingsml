It will help increase the availability, quality and efficiency of health services and make them more responsive to the public's expectations. Together with the contributions of other donors, the project will constitute a coherent program to support the government in developing strategies to address the most critical sector issues. Specifically the project will: (i) strengthen the Ministry of Public Health's capacity to design and implement key sector reforms; (ii) improve the efficiency and affordability of health care delivery in rural areas; (iii) contribute to reducing population growth and maternal and child mortality rates; and (iv) promote beneficial health and family planning behaviors."},"country_namecode":"Republic
