Specifically, it will construct irrigation works on 32,300 ha to be planted with food, fiber and fodder crops; improve 44,700 ha of rainfed pasture through fertilizing, fencing and seeding; and introduce improved animal breeds.  To handle the increased production of raw materials, the project will construct and equip agroprocessing facilities such as cottonseed oil processing plants, wool processing plants, slaughterhouses and raisin production facilities.  In addition to agroprocessing equipment, the project will provide tractors, combine harvesters, balers, silage equipment, scrapers with laser-control, bulldozers, fuel tankers and refrigerated trunks.  A project-supported training component will be used to train equipment operators, plant managers and workers, and project personnel."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of China!$!CN","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ZH</LangCode><ProjectName>\u65b0\u7586\u519c\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u9879\u76ee</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u52a0\u5feb\u534e\u5317\u548c\u897f\u90e8\u5730\u533a\u8d2b\u56f0\u7701\u4efd\u53d1\u5c55\u6b65\u4f10\u7684\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u6269\u5927\u65b0\u7586\u5317\u90e820\u5bb6\u56fd\u8425\u519c\u573a\u519c\u4e1a\u704c\u6e89\u9762\u79ef\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u8349\u573a\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u755c\u7267\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u5177\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5efa\u8bbe3.23\u4e07\u516c\u9877\u519c\u7530\u548c\u8349\u573a\u7684\u704c\u6e89\u5de5\u7a0b\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u80a5\u3001\u642d\u5efa\u56f4\u680f\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u79cd\u5b50\u6539\u55844.47\u4e07\u516c\u9877\u96e8\u6d47\u8349\u573a\u751f\u4ea7\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5f15\u8fdb\u6539\u826f\u755c\u7267\u54c1\u79cd\u3002\u4e3a\u589e\u52a0\u539f\u6750\u6599\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5efa\u8bbe\u5e76\u88c5\u914d\u519c\u4ea7\u54c1\u52a0\u5de5\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5982\u68c9\u82b1\u79cd\u5b50\u52a0\u5de5\u5382\u3001\u7f8a\u6bdb\u52a0\u5de5\u5382\u3001\u5c60\u5bb0\u573a\u548c\u8461\u8404\u5e72\u751f\u4ea7\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u63d0\u4f9b\u519c\u4ea7\u54c1\u52a0\u5de5\u8bbe\u5907\u5916\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u4e5f\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u62d6\u62c9\u673a\u3001\u8054\u5408\u6536\u5272\u673a\u3001\u6253\u5305\u673a\u3001\u5207\u8349\u673a\u3001\u6fc0\u5149\u63a7\u5236\u5e73\u5730\u673a\u3001\u63a8\u571f\u673a\u3001\u6cb9\u7f50\u8f66\u548c\u51b7\u85cf\u8f66\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u8fd8\u5c06\u5bf9\u8bbe\u5907\u64cd\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u3001\u5de5\u5382\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u5de5\u4eba\u4ee5\u53ca\u9879\u76ee\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u57f9\u8bad\u3002</ProjectAbstract></Project>]]>","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"70,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CN","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019204733","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019204733","DocDate":"15-MAR-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090120283445","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120283445","DocURL":"14-SEP-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090120283445","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090120283445","DocDate":"14-SEP-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e3683e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e3683e_1_0","DocDate":"03-MAR-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960926034846","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926034846","DocDate":"03-FEB-1987"}],"countryname":"People's Republic of China"}},"facets":{}}
