This is a level two restructuring to extend the closing date. The extension of the closing dates is necessary to ensure that the project continues to provide logistical support to the continued implementation and completion of the second Iraq Household and Socio-economic Survey (IHSES-2). The extension of the closing date is necessary to ensure that the World Bank has sufficient time to deliver technical assistance (TA) activities and build capacity for relevant policy analysis of data and production of the poverty estimates and their determinants, which will feed into the formulation of the second Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) in 2013. The need for extension arises from the delays in forming a government after the 2010 election, which slowed down the functioning of the government, as well as security concerns impacting on the ability to conduct field activities. This will be the fourth and final extension of the closing date."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Iraq!$!IQ","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":29},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":14},"theme3":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"6,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Project Paper,Implementation Status and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"IQ","sectorcode":"BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management","Economic management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"22,53,54,51,24","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"1,6,6,6,1","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring","code":"53"},{"name":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","code":"22"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000461832_20140129101013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000461832_20140129101013","DocDate":"22-JAN-2014"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b081d552e4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081d552e4_1_0","DocDate":"22-JUL-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"090224b0818686a5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0818686a5_1_0","DocDate":"07-JAN-2013"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.2","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20121102004204","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20121102004204","DocDate":"28-SEP-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PJPR","EntityID":"000356161_20121102003943","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20121102003943","DocDate":"27-SEP-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2012071011185163","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012071011185163","DocDate":"10-JUL-2012"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011102207285633","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011102207285633","DocDate":"22-OCT-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000171540_2010072109254072","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2010072109254072","DocDate":"19-JUL-2010"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000104615_20060313112756","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20060313112756","DocDate":"13-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000104615_20060221091249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20060221091249","DocDate":"07-FEB-2006"}],"countryname":"Republic of Iraq","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
