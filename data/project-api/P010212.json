It consists of:  (a) the erection of about 3,815 km of transmission lines, (b) the construction of 139 new substations, (c) the extension and reinforcement of another 86 existing substations, and (d) studies, technical assistance and training.  This last component involves: (i) preparing an investment program for reducing losses in the transmission network, (ii) preparing a program of action to improve power plant efficiency, (iii) developing a least cost national power plan, and (iv) modernizing WAPDA's internal audit system and strengthening its accounting capabilities. The proposed project consists of normal electric utility work entailing no unusual risks and there should be no difficulty in its execution."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"100,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"PY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","code":"PY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019174131","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019174131","DocDate":"29-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970716151825","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970716151825","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818102146","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818102146","DocDate":"28-FEB-1985"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
