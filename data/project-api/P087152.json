The additional loan will meet the financing gap relating to existing project activities. The Phase II Project experienced a cost overrun, predominantly in the technology platform refining and scaling-up component. Since this is Mexico's home-grown solution to the information technology needs of the rural financial sector, it has had to address many undefined \"firsts\". This additional loan finances this cost escalation."},"country_namecode":"United Mexican States!$!MX","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>ES</LangCode><ProjectName>Proyecto de Ahorro y
