Project components will: 1) develop inclusive business clusters, through contract service providers to facilitate, and identify cross-cluster business environment constraints, and reform proposals, improve productivity, and develop operational plans. The component will also pilot sustainable information technology (IT) based BDS, through technical assistance provision, and equipment/software supply for the development of an IT business development center, which will provide training, quality assurance, export facilitation, design assistance, and information on financing for micro and small businesses; 2) pilot reforms for competitiveness policies, institutions and administrative procedures related to private sector development. Consensus will be built for incorporating the private sector in the management of public training system, assess alternatives, and monitor implementation. Innovations on domestic competition will be tested, addressing best practices, deregulation, and consumer protection, as well as investment promotion activities; and 3) increase public-private management capacity on competition policy."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Nicaragua!$!NI","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":53},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":24},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":21},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"NI","sectorcode":"BG,BC,FE,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB,PPP","themecode":"44,40,45,41","combined_practice_name":"Jobs,Public Private Partnership","mjthemecode":"4,5,4,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","code":"41"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB,PPP","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":53},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":24},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":21},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070208100411","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070208100411","DocDate":"18-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201180199","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201180199","DocURL":"24-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051415543640","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051415543640","DocDate":"24-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201180098","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201180098","DocURL":"24-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201180199","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201180199","DocDate":"24-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201180098","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201180098","DocDate":"24-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01011305321965","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01011305321965","DocDate":"26-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00111505392117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00111505392117","DocDate":"01-DEC-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Nicaragua","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs,Public Private Partnership"}},"facets":{}}
