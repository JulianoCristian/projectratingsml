This is part of a planned 138 km expressway between Helsinki and Lusi, a town 40 km north of Lahti. The rapid development of the area between Helsinki and Lahti and the expected increase in traffic indicate a need to extend the expressway to Lusi, where traffic then fans out to the north and northeast; and (b) the paving of about 910 km of roads included in the Government's 1971 paving program which comprises about 2,530 km of roads."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Finland!$!FI","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"13,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"FI","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e6a623_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e6a623_1_0","DocDate":"09-FEB-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903180418","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903180418","DocDate":"31-JAN-1971"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903321417","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903321417","DocDate":"31-JAN-1971"}],"countryname":"Republic of Finland"}},"facets":{}}
