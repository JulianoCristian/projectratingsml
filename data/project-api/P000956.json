The project will strive to achieve this by rehabilitating roads and transport facilities, improving access to low income areas, and building capacity in the institutions responsible for the policy development and planning of urban transport and the maintenance of its related infrastructure.  There are five main components: (a) road rehabilitation in Accra and Sekondi/Takoradi; (b) traffic management improvements; (c) lorry park and bus terminal rehabilitation; (d) construction of non-motorized transport facilities and access roads to low-income areas; and (e) technical assistance to central and local government agencies for policy development, project preparation and implementation, and institutional development.  The road rehabilitation works will focus on Accra and Sekondi/Takoradi, where the problems are most acute, while the traffic management and public transport terminal improvements will be carried out in all five cities.  The policy and institutional aspects will benefit the whole country."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","sector1":{"Name":"Roads and highways","Percent":51},"sector2":{"Name":"General transportation sector","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":14},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"76,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Roads and highways"},{"Name":"General transportation sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GH","sectorcode":"BC,TZ,TA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,71","mjthemecode":"9,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Roads and highways","code":"TA"},{"name":"General transportation sector","code":"TZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":51},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":35},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":14}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_00082605462851","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00082605462851","DocDate":"29-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121170059","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121170059","DocURL":"26-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121170059","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121170059","DocDate":"26-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121165558","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121165558","DocDate":"26-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121165558","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121165558","DocURL":"26-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121170460","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121170460","DocURL":"26-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121170460","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121170460","DocDate":"26-JUL-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e125a9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e125a9_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004062105","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004062105","DocDate":"20-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004061923","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004061923","DocDate":"20-APR-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Ghana"}},"facets":{}}
