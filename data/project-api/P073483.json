To this end, community-based approaches will be tested to support adolescents, and youth at risk, and, institutional capacity will be strengthened, to contribute to the implementation of a Children and Youth Strategy. The two main components will: 1) continue to test methods, and experimentation, through existing Babylon youth centers. The inter-ethnic youth activities cover sports, computer, and information technology (IT) training. And, in addition to regular scholastic activities, English language, social skills and creativity, journalism, and seminars and workshops will be supported. Innovative approaches will be explored for youth social integration, through the use of outreach, and targeted pilot programs, by establishing eight new centers, proposed by nongovernmental organizations in a demand-driven selection process, designed to elicit new ideas in disadvantaged areas. Expansion of the Youth and Sport's innovative drug abuse prevention program will be supported for all secondary schools in the country, and to the Babylon centers; and, 2) consolidate the youth component, by supporting the participatory development of the Children, and Youth Strategy, to promote ownership, and sustainability of the program, and, by establishing monitoring mechanisms to facilitate institutional capacity building."},"country_namecode":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of!$!MK","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":80},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":10},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Other social protection and risk management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":24},"totalcommamt":"2,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"MK","sectorcode":"BC,BH,JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social protection and risk management","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management"],"themecode":"51,55,89,56,57","mjthemecode":"7,6,8,6,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other social protection and risk management","code":"56"},{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"},{"name":"Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","code":"55"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":80},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000310607_20070718095142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070718095142","DocDate":"29-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201234226","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201234226","DocURL":"05-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01061904015327","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01061904015327","DocDate":"07-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_0103100530388","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0103100530388","DocDate":"27-FEB-2001"}],"countryname":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of"}},"facets":{}}
