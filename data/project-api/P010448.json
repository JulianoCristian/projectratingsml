The project includes five components. The first component, research management, based on the development the Indian Council for Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), will improve the management and coordination of forestry research and extension through staff training, studies and consultancies to develop priority setting methodologies and a management information system, and provision of a headquarters building and equipment. The second component, research program support, will provide necessary infrastructure, equipment and operating expenses for selected research programs in ICFRE institutes, establish a research grant fund to commission research by public and private sector agencies, take measures to improve the quality of planting stock, human resource development through staff training, scientific review of institutes and programs, and improve the library and information systems and statistical services. The third component, forestry education, involves the development and validation of forestry curricula in formal education through provision of funds for review and revision work, and development of the Deemed Forestry University at Dehra Dun, primarily by financing post-graduate research awards. The fourth component, forestry policy and preparation, will strengthen capabilities within the Ministry of Forests and Environment (MOEF) for the analysis of forest policies and preparation of future forestry projects through staff training and provision for studies and consultancies.
