Primary school teaching and management will be improved through the development of an integrated support system linking primary teacher colleges to a surrounding network of primary schools to provide field-based upgrading and continuous in-service training for school managers and instructional staff and the rehabilitation and construction of primary school and related teacher training facilities; the provision of learning resources, particularly textbooks and supplementary reading materials; and the revitalization of the private sector capacity to produce such learning resources.  Strategic planning, policy analysis, management and implementation functions will be enhanced by strengthening the Ministry of Education and Sports Planning Unit and conducting special policy studies in the areas of secondary education, book policy development and the national assessment of educational performance; upgrading management and information systems, particularly in the areas of personnel, accounting and auditing; reforming the curriculum and examinations; and expanding and decentralizing implementation capacity."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uganda!$!UG","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":53},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":27},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"theme4":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":17},"totalcommamt":"52,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"UG","sectorcode":"ET,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,57,25,65","mjthemecode":"8,2,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":53},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":27},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20040120110828","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040120110828","DocDate":"08-JAN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02030804043223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02030804043223","DocDate":"15-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121163750","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121163750","DocURL":"22-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121163750","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121163750","DocDate":"22-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e12595_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e12595_1_0","DocDate":"13-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961002070324","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002070324","DocDate":"31-MAR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002070456","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002070456","DocDate":"19-MAR-1993"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uganda"}},"facets":{}}
