Credit proceeds will be re-allocated to reflect the newly agreed scope of the project. The original amount of the credit will be reduced by ten million US dollars (equivalent to SDR 6.931 million) and cancelled from the credit. The partial cancellation amount will be re-committed to the general International Development Association (IDA) pool for Ghana and towards support for fast moving projects. Project outcomes are unchanged; however, the outcome indicators are being modified to better reflect the revised scope of the project. The changes in the results framework include: a) transforming the Project Development Objective (PDO) indicators into a set of Specific, Measurable, Attributable, Relevant and Time-bound (SMART) indicators which reflect the intentions and content of the original PDO; b) consolidating and revising a number of indicators to ensure they are relevant and clearly defined; c) dropping a number of indicators that appear to be of little relevance to the revised project, and/or lack data sources; and d) two separate lists of indicators. The project will be extended for 18 months and the new closing date for project is June 30, 2013."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Ghana!$!GH","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Projet d'aide aux micro-, petites et moyennes entreprises du Ghana</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le Projet d'aide aux micro-, petites et moyennes entreprises du Ghana vise \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 et les niveaux d'emploi des micro-, petites et moyennes entreprises ghan\u00e9ennes (MPME).
