This is a level second restructuring which encompasses a cumulative extension of the closing date by 30 months as well as a revision of the results framework targets, for which RVP approval is sought. The project changes: (i) the extension of the closing date from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012. This represents a 30 month cumulative extension, from the original closing date of December 31, 2009; and (ii) the revision of targets of the Project Development Objective (PDO) indicators. The data sources are the Sudan Health Management Information System (HMIS) for outpatient consultations and the specific Reproductive Health database1 for the antenatal care and birth attended by
