The changes will align the project development objective (PDO) with the outcomes that can be expected from this project, rather than from the national basic education development strategy (NBEDS) of the Government of Yemen (GOY), and will articulate a results framework for the project that includes relevant and measurable outcome and intermediate outcome indicators and targets. The project will also build the capacity of the minister of education (MoE) to monitor and evaluate innovations that are being piloted under the project, accommodate the GOY'S request for a closing date extension from June 30,2010 to June 30,2012, and reallocate Credit and Multi-Donor Trust Fund Grant funds between disbursement categories."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
