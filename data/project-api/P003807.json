The project will create a demand for some 21 million man-days of labor over the construction period, and will increase rice production by about 36,000 tons/year by 1990. The main risk facing the project is that, in the Sitiung II component, agricultural benefits might build up slower than projected; however, sensitivity analysis indicates that this risk lies within tolerable limits. Other project components, including designs and studies of future projects and assistance to DGWRD for institution building, bear low risk."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"37,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925100953","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925100953","DocDate":"29-MAY-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902391287","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902391287","DocDate":"31-MAR-1982"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e9738d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e9738d_1_0","DocDate":"30-MAR-1982"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
