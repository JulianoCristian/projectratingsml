The program will contribute towards meeting the huge investment need that the ongoing project was unable to meet (originally estimated to be around US$150 million). The additional financing will also seek to support continued improved financial viability of DVK, by facilitating improved revenue collections, and implementation of more modem financial management and accounting practices. Continued repair and rehabilitation of the DVK water supply system is in line with the priorities of the Government of Tajikistan (GOT) and DVK, who recognize the importance of improved and safe water supply in poverty reduction as well as in supporting improved health and environment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Tajikistan!$!TJ","sector1":{"Name":"Water
