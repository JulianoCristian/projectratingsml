The paving of the approximately 1,600 km of highway included in the project would increase the total of paved national highways from about 4,000 km to about 5,600 km. The project includes the construction of a major bridge across the Magdalena River, which would replace overcrowded ferries on the only direct highway between Barranquilla and Santa Marta, the two largest ports on Colombia's Atlantic coast. The project also includes the upgrading of a 9.5 km highway from El Pailon to Buenaventura, thus improving access to Colombia's largest port on the Pacific coast."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"32,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901014475","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901014475","DocDate":"02-FEB-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67f60_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67f60_1_0","DocDate":"12-MAY-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903170115","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903170115","DocDate":"30-APR-1970"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101903321823","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903321823","DocDate":"30-APR-1970"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
