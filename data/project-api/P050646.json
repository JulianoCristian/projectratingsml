The project has seven components. 1) The on-farm development and land reclamation component addresses the need for beneficiary-led, on-farm reclamation efforts in sodic soil areas of the state of Uttar Pradesh. Active community participation and well coordinated government intervention are critical elements in the project approach. 2) The rehabilitation and maintenance of main drains component will improve the drain network which will have positive environmental impact by reversing, arresting, or delaying the process the sodic land formation. 3) Technology dissemination will establish a community-based, demand driven system for technology dissemination in the project districts. 4) Upgrading farm to market roads will take up rural roads construction in areas where sodic land is being reclaimed. 5) Human resources development and institutional capacity building of support services will focus on staff training and institutional strengthening in the Panchayats, nongovernmental organizations, and executing government agencies. 6) Adaptive research will verify and refine the available technologies to suit the specific needs of local farmers and to bring about sustainable increases in the productivity of sodic lands through reclamation. 7) Project management will be the responsibility of the Uttar Pradesh Bhumi Sudhar Nigam (UPBSN)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
