There are two amin project components. First, in the initial phase of this component, marshland will be recovered and restored in two already identified sites to demonstrate the use of wetlands as nutrient sinks. Additional sites are expected to be identified and restored later during project implementation. The GEF funds will finance consultancy services for the elaboration of detailed engineering designs, baseline surveys, and the supervision of construction and rehabilitation activities of small infrastructure which will regulate water flows. Grantsupport is being sought for consultant services pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, design of restoration activities, and needed civil works. The second component supports the next step towards sustainable resource managmeent and protection within the two protected sites by funding the preparation of protected areas management plans at the two sites. It moves on to then support the implementation of priority actions identified in these plans; strengthens monitoring programs for water quality, biodiversity, socioeconomic indicators, and health risks; builds a public awareness and education campaign; and strengthens land/water management institutions."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Bulgaria!$!BG","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":91},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"7,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"BG","sectorcode":"BC,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"80,79,84,82,85","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11,11,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":91},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20090821050136","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20090821050136","DocDate":"23-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02060404024679","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02060404024679","DocDate":"17-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00031505341938","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00031505341938","DocDate":"13-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02030704011091","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02030704011091","DocDate":"13-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02022704080546","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022704080546","DocDate":"01-JAN-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Bulgaria","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
