The Bank support for this project is part of a multi-faceted effort by the international community to help reduce the fragility of the economy and the state. The approach aims to develop a strategic platform based on three pillars: (i) satisfactory macroeconomic program and improved fiscal stability; (ii) stimulating growth; and (iii) alleviating poverty. The project aims to ensure that educational services are maintained in 2008, paving the way for more substantial support in 2009, beyond that to be provided under the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea-Bissau!$!GW","projectinfo":"<![CDATA[<Project><LangCode>FR</LangCode><ProjectName>Projet d'urgence de prestation de services publics</ProjectName><ProjectAbstract>Le Projet d\u2019urgence pour la fourniture de services publics en R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e Bissau a pour objectif de contribuer \u00e0 la fourniture ininterrompue des services publics essentiels, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la mise \u00e0 disposition de ressources en vue du paiement des salaires des enseignants.
