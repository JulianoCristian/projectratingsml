The project consists of three components. The first component will support strengthening institutional capacity of the Institute of Biodiversity Conservation and Research (IBCR), developing human resources capacity of collaborating institutions for implementing project activities, establishing a medicinal plant field gene bank, and establishing a Project Coordinating Unit. The second component will support development of methods to collect, analyze, and interpret quantitative data on socio-economic benefits derived from medicinal plants used in human and livestock healthcare on a national level, ethno medical surveys to explore utilization of medicinal plants and traditional healthcare practices for prevention of HIV and mitigation of adverse impact of AIDS, and research on propagation of cultivation methods of selected commonly used medicinal plants for human and livestock. The third component funded by GEF will support in-situ conservation, management and sustainable use of medicinal plants in the Bale Mountains National Park and surrounding forests."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":67},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":33},"theme1":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"2,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"80,82,86,88,89","mjthemecode":"8,8,11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS","code":"88"},{"name":"Other environment and natural resources management","code":"86"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Biodiversity","code":"80"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":67},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":33}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201181912","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201181912","DocDate":"16-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201181912","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201181912","DocURL":"16-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201182013","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201182013","DocDate":"16-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01013105315649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01013105315649","DocDate":"22-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99080405380711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99080405380711","DocDate":"23-JUL-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99080405381117","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99080405381117","DocDate":"23-JUL-1999"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
