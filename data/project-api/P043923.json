The project is intended to: 1) strengthen the planning and institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education, Youth Affairs and Sports (MOE) to guide and carry out the long-term development of the sector, while enabling it to initiate significant, urgent measures to address system-wide qualitative problems and expansion needs at the secondary level; and 2) serve as a catalyst for a major adjustment process, focused on revision to more reasonable levels of primary and secondary teacher to student ratios, in line with ratios of countries of comparable economic and social development. The project comprises three major components: 1) a strengthening management and planning component; 2) a qualitative improvement of basic education component, which will enhance the quality of teaching and learning; and 3) an expansion and conservation of school places component, which will assist MOE to provide more secondary school places in the most under-served districts to reduce long distance travel and facilitate access to educational opportunities."},"country_namecode":"Grenada!$!GD","sector1":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":35},"sector2":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":21},"sector4":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":9},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"7,660,000","sector":[{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Loan Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GD","sectorcode":"ET,BC,EP,ES","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,51,65","mjthemecode":"8,6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":35},{"Name":"Education","Percent":35},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":21},{"Name":"Education","Percent":9}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02060908195961","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02060908195961","DocDate":"18-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123382968","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123382968","DocURL":"26-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123382968","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123382968","DocDate":"26-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123383270","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123383270","DocDate":"26-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123383069","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123383069","DocDate":"26-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123383270","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123383270","DocURL":"26-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123383069","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123383069","DocURL":"26-FEB-1996"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e23c1d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23c1d_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23c1c_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23c1c_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb9e_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb9e_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081eacb9d_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081eacb9d_1_0","DocDate":"21-DEC-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019150947","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019150947","DocDate":"29-NOV-1995"}],"countryname":"Grenada"}},"facets":{}}
