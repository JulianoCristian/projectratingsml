The reforms supported by this operation aim at strengthening social assistance programs to function better as a cushion to protect the poorest and those vulnerable to fall into poverty due to the economic slowdown and future reforms. Moreover, this operation supports a significant structural reform agenda aimed at unlocking new sources of recovery and medium term growth, particularly through further price liberalization, reducing the costs of entry for new businesses, reducing regulatory and administrative costs of operation for the private sector, reducing subsidies, and eliminating inefficient taxes. At the same time, it supports initial steps in setting the legal and institutional basis for an adequate and transparent privatization process."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Belarus!$!BY","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":30},"sector2":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"Other industry","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General energy sector","Percent":10},"sector5":{"Name":"General finance sector","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":30},"theme2":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":10},"theme3":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":10},"theme4":{"Name":"Macroeconomic management","Percent":10},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":40},"totalcommamt":"200,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Other industry"},{"Name":"General energy sector"},{"Name":"General finance sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"BY","sectorcode":"FZ,LZ,YW,JB,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Urban development","Public sector governance","Economic management","Financial and private sector development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"40,23,28,71,54","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"6,9,2,1,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Other industry","code":"YW"},{"name":"General energy sector","code":"LZ"},{"name":"General finance sector","code":"FZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Macroeconomic management","code":"23"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":30},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":30},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":10},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20130918100028","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130918100028","DocDate":"20-FEB-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000014464_2010041913102065","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010041913102065","DocDate":"03-DEC-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000334955_20091105023413","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20091105023413","DocDate":"22-OCT-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000101930_20091020174805","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000101930_20091020174805","DocDate":"30-SEP-2009"}],"countryname":"Republic of Belarus","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
