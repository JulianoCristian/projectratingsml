The project consists of: (a) development of KIET comprising: (i) physical facilities including a semiconductor building, other buildings, support facilities, and equipment; and (ii) technology-related items including training, expert invitation, and the purchase of technology; (b) research, development, and engineering program designed to promote and finance research carried out at KIET for the benefit of the Korean electronics industry. While the risks inherent in this complex project which would operate in a rapidly changing technological environment are higher than for projects in most other industries, the potential benefits as well as the costs of inaction considerably outweigh the risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"29,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Other industry"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"IY","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Industry","code":"IX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Other industry","code":"IY"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924211840","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924211840","DocDate":"30-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902323066","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902323066","DocDate":"31-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e458_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e458_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAR-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e8e456_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e8e456_1_0","DocDate":"22-MAR-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
