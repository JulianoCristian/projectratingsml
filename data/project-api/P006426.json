To that end, the project involves several components including construction of two state-managed irrigation schemes totalling 2,840 ha and benefitting 750 farm families; studies for possible future irrigation projects; construction or rehabilitation of about 170 simple rural water supply systems; and adaptive agricultural research and basic seed production. In addition, the project provides for extension services to about 38,000 small farmers; investment credit for about 12,000 farms including 3,250 irrigated farms; marketing support services for private traders and small farmers; and funding for project administration; and training."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":20},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":28},"sector3":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":29},"sector4":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":6},"sector5":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":17},"theme1":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":20},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":20},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":20},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":20},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"55,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"JB,BG,FE,AB,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social protection and risk management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"85,79,57,77,51","mjthemecode":"6,10,7,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":20},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":28},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":29},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":6},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":17}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420171033","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420171033","DocDate":"24-JUN-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032510173016","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032510173016","DocDate":"20-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2010042615064017","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042615064017","DocDate":"20-JUL-1987"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3960926064056","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960926064056","DocDate":"01-JUN-1987"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
