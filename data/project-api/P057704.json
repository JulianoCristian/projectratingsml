The project will restructure the organizational and financial systems in the sector and attract private investment to manage and operate publicly-held enterprises in the sector. The project funds the  operating expenses of the Secretariat Unit and provides technical assistance in three phases: 1) Phase 1 assesses deficiencies in trade logistics and potential for container transshipment at Egyptian ports and recommends a strategy to improve efficiency; and develops specifications and bid documents for port/trade management systems including EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) systems to facilitate trade. 2) Phase 2 develops a policy framework which accommodates greater private participation in ports; and produces draft regulations for the port sector to implement the new policy of private participation. 3) Phase 3 a) creates a new structure for a corporatized organization in the sector and assists in its implementation; b) restructures the financial management systems for port sector entities to make them autonomous and self-financing; and c) develops a plan for privatizing selected units and a labor redeployment program."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":78},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":22},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"2,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"BG,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"43,45,40","mjthemecode":"4,5,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":78},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":22}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2010022613555959","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010022613555959","DocDate":"22-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980929101649","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980929101649","DocDate":"15-MAY-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000009265_3980624143040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980624143040","DocDate":"06-MAY-1998"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
