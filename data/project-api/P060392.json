The project consists of three components. The first component will: 1) support the implementation of a new medium term plan for immunizations; 2) implement new strategies for the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness and for the Mother-Baby Package; and 3) provide resources to finance demand-driven local subprojects. The second component will 1) support the implementation of a basic health insurance system; 2) strengthen the development of the management information system; and 3) strengthen the capacity and accountability of the health districts to manage and supervise the implementation of project activities. The third component will finance the establishment and operation within the Ministry of Health of a management structure appropriate for the coordination of all project activities and the monitoring and evaluation of the project in accordance with the project performance benchmarks."},"country_namecode":"Plurinational State of Bolivia!$!BO","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":74},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":12},"sector3":{"Name":"Compulsory health finance","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":3},"sector5":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":3},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"25,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Compulsory health finance"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"BO","sectorcode":"BC,JB,BK,BH,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,67,57,69,63","mjthemecode":"8,8,7,8,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Compulsory health finance","code":"BK"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":74},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":8},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":3},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":3}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20040617153801","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040617153801","DocDate":"09-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9904210531450","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9904210531450","DocDate":"31-MAR-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99062405303968","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99062405303968","DocDate":"19-FEB-1999"}],"countryname":"Plurinational State of Bolivia"}},"facets":{}}
