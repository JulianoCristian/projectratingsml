The second component is an Institutional Strengthening one which will provide for: 1) technical assistance for the restructuring and decentralization of the MOE, and improved supervision; 2) a pilot program of teacher performance incentives; and 3) project administration, monitoring and evaluation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Honduras!$!HN","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":59},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":31},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":5},"sector4":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme2":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":13},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"HN","sectorcode":"EC,ET,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Human development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,65,26,25,57","mjthemecode":"7,2,2,8,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":59},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":31},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20040805112215","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20040805112215","DocDate":"14-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_02072504042556","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02072504042556","DocDate":"14-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122040538","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122040538","DocURL":"21-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122041339","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122041339","DocURL":"21-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122040538","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122040538","DocDate":"21-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122041339","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122041339","DocDate":"21-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e23808_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e23808_1_0","DocDate":"28-MAR-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007191520","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007191520","DocDate":"08-MAR-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Honduras"}},"facets":{}}
