Specifically, it will: (a) improve the MOH's ability to plan, monitor and evaluate health programs and policies; (b) strengthen the MOH's capacity to carry out epidemiological studies with supporting laboratory services; (c) improve the system for procuring and distributing pharmaceuticals; (d) extend primary health care services to selected districts; and (e) introduce child spacing services as an element of the MOH's maternal and child health program. MOH will have overall responsibility for project implementation. The project is expected to significantly reduce recurrent account budgetary outlays for pharmaceuticals and extend primary health care services to 120,000 people. Successful implementation of the project and preparation of an updated ten-year national health plan will set the stage for reductions in mortality and fertility. The national health plan also will provide the basis for future investments from both local and foreign sources."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Malawi!$!MW","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"6,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MW","sectorcode":"HB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Basic health","code":"HB"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925164051","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925164051","DocDate":"28-DEC-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e058fa_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e058fa_1_0","DocDate":"26-APR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902412452","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902412452","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101901015911","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101901015911","DocDate":"31-MAR-1983"}],"countryname":"Republic of Malawi"}},"facets":{}}
