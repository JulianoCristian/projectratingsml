The project has the following four components: Component 1) will directly address non-income dimensions of youth poverty and social exclusion such as powerlessness (often linked with lack of information and isolation); vulnerability and exposure to risky behaviors (e.g. drug abuse, alcoholism) due to idleness and lack of spaces for safe and constructive free-time activities; and gender-specific dimensions of vulnerability such as domestic violence. Indirect outcomes on income-dimensions of poverty are also expected to occur as youth-serving spaces and civil society initiatives will be encouraged to provide skills enhancement activities leading to possible future income-generation activities. This component includes two sub-components: (i) the establishment of a network of regional youth-friendly centers; and (ii) a competitive grants program for youth-serving civil society associations to promote their creative initiatives for youth's socio-economic inclusion and empowerment (increased social capital and participation in decision-making). Component 2) in selected regions, this component will create enabling conditions for unemployed and/or precariously employed adult young women and men to invest in skills and assets leading to better self- and wage -employment opportunities. This component concentrates on testing mechanisms to increase responsiveness to, and demand for youth within the financing and the economic sector (financing institutions, enterprises).
