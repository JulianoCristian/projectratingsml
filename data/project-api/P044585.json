The components will: 1) finance the rehabilitation of new classrooms for primary, and middle schools, expected to increase school enrollment capacity. Additionally, rehabilitation works will also include sanitation services; 2) improve teacher training curricula, upgrade qualifications of training staff, and expand the capacity of the Personnel Training Center for National Education (CEPEN), to provide improved training to primary school teachers. This would entail additional classroom construction, and refurbishment at the Center, as well as provision of subsidies to teachers during training. Technical assistance (TA) will be provided to the National Education Research and Information Production Center (CRIPEN), for the reform of grades 1-9 curriculum, and for the development of new textbooks. Training will also be provided for Head Masters on administrative, pedagogic, and community relations responsibilities; and, 3) improve the Government's capacity to manage sector reforms, by supporting the activities of the National Education Organization Committee (CNOSEGE) to coordinate reforms, and manage resources. The component will also finance capacity building of the Ministry of Education's Planning Unit, and the Education Projects Bureau; and, TA will improve public-private partnerships, effective gender strategies, and textbook policy reforms."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Djibouti!$!DJ","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":58},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":37},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Gender","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Executive Director's Statement,Executive Director's Statement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment","countrycode":"DJ","sectorcode":"ET,BC,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"59,78,65,57","mjthemecode":"7,8,10,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Gender","code":"59"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":58},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":37},{"Name":"Education","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20060324151420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20060324151420","DocDate":"21-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20051229102159","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20051229102159","DocDate":"21-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123575353","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123575353","DocURL":"22-JAN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Executive Director's Statement (Executive Director's Statement),  Vol.1","DocType":"Executive Director's Statement","EntityID":"000456286_20140408113726","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20140408113726","DocDate":"18-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Executive Director's Statement (Executive Director's Statement),  Vol.1","DocType":"Executive Director's Statement","EntityID":"000456286_20140408113906","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20140408113906","DocDate":"18-DEC-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00113005324280","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00113005324280","DocDate":"17-NOV-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00062305373026","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00062305373026","DocDate":"27-OCT-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_00081806165410","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00081806165410","DocDate":"23-JUL-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Djibouti"}},"facets":{}}
