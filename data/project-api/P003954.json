The project components are: 1) support for policy and institutional reform for integrated water resources management; river basin planning in three basins; and improved real-time water management operations in five basins; 2) strengthening hydrological data and information systems; 3) support for special maintenance of small irrigation schemes; 4) irrigation rehabilitation, expansion and upgrading, and remedial works; 5) introduction of sustainable, efficient operation and maintenance to avoid the need for repeat rehabilitation; and 6) the expansion of Irrigation Service Fees to schemes above 500 ha in size in all remaining areas of Java to establish user-pays systems and support operation and maintenance."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"165,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"BZ,AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"26,82,85","mjthemecode":"11,11,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":75},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20030707131401","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20030707131401","DocDate":"30-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123042466","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123042466","DocURL":"25-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123042466","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123042466","DocDate":"25-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123042365","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123042365","DocDate":"25-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123042365","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123042365","DocURL":"25-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123042667","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123042667","DocURL":"25-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123042667","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123042667","DocDate":"25-JUL-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e99e45_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e99e45_1_0","DocDate":"21-JUN-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961006040613","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006040613","DocDate":"25-MAY-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961006040233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961006040233","DocDate":"25-MAY-1994"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
