All of Cali's and Yumbo's population would benefit from the reduction of the very hazardous level of pollution at the point of water intake from the Cauca River, and about 250,000 people, 70% of which are among Colombia's poorest 40%, would benefit directly from the other components."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"13,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3970818101439","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970818101439","DocDate":"27-DEC-1984"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902292017","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902292017","DocDate":"28-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f63_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f63_1_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e84f62_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84f62_1_0","DocDate":"21-FEB-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912180415","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912180415","DocDate":"31-JAN-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
