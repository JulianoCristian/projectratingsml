The project will facilitate the implementation of the medium-term macroeconomic adjustment program introduced in 1990.  The strategy to sustain institutional development includes:  (a) ensuring adequate legislative and administrative rules in targeted institutions; (b) revising existing procedures and adopting new ones for resource/budgetary use in those institutions; and (c) beginning to build national capacity to plan, manage, and communicate resource management issues, through training Burkinabe, rather than through widespread long-term technical assistance.  Specifically, the project will:  (a) reinforce information and budgetary management functions in the  Administrative and Finance Departments and the Research and Planning Departments of four priority ministries (Finance, Health, Education, and Civil Service); (b) finance a civil service census and introduce new procedures for civil service management and training; (c) support an updating of Burkina's public procurement code, legislation, and procedures; (d) through legal, procedural reforms, and training, assist in creating a favorable business climate with appropriate commercial laws, judicial practices and personnel; and (e) finance the training of Burkinabe journalists in economic journalism so as to improve the quality of analysis and reporting of economic policies."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":81},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":19},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"15,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Law and justice"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"BF","sectorcode":"BG,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Public sector governance","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"25,27,34","mjthemecode":"3,2,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":81},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":19}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01061404082480","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01061404082480","DocDate":"29-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121104209","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121104209","DocURL":"29-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121103608","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121103608","DocDate":"29-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121103307","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121103307","DocURL":"29-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121103608","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121103608","DocURL":"29-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121104209","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121104209","DocDate":"29-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121103307","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121103307","DocDate":"29-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e39187_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e39187_1_0","DocDate":"04-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002211324","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002211324","DocDate":"12-MAY-1992"}],"countryname":"Burkina Faso"}},"facets":{}}
