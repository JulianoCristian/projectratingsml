The changes to the project include: (i) the extension of closing date of the project from April 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013, and (ii) a revision of the results framework due to the modified timeline for activities and to ensure common monitoring and evaluation approaches across multiple recipients. These changes are required because of delays in implementation which are primarily due to the slow approval process of safeguards documentation by Government in the early stages of the project, as well as instability in some of the target areas. The restructuring will allow the project to successfully achieve its objectives by the closing date."},"country_namecode":"Central African Republic!$!CF","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture,
