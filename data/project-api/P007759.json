About 172,000 people (1971 census) in about 550 dispersed villages would benefit from the project, with an estimated 250,000 to be served in these villages by 1988; the population to be reached is made up mostly of persons within the lowest income groups in Nicargua. Most of the project benefits are unquantifiable (increased work productivity, increase in effective nutrition), and with an integrated project of this nature it is difficult to isolate the benefits of each component. It is clear, however, that the project will contribute substantially to improvements in health and welfare generally, as reflected in the provision of safe water, increased life expectancy and reduced mortality rates of infants and young children."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Nicaragua!$!NI","sector1":{"Name":"Sewerage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"3,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sewerage"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Loan Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"NI","sectorcode":"WS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sewerage","code":"WS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902291915","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902291915","DocDate":"30-NOV-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_9810191226438","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810191226438","DocDate":"30-NOV-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e84be1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84be1_1_0","DocDate":"29-NOV-1977"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b081e84be0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e84be0_1_0","DocDate":"29-NOV-1977"}],"countryname":"Republic of Nicaragua"}},"facets":{}}
