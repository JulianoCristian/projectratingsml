To achieve these aims, the project supports three main components. The first component rehabilitates fishing port facilities and supports the institutional strengthening of Fishery Management Organizations to improve their management of fishing port facilities, and to promote self-regulation as the key to sustainable marine resource management. To that end, the project recruits national coordiantors and regional promoters, supplies international technical assistance to the FMOs, prepares fishery management plans, develops marine ecotourism, and supports training and demonstration programs. The second component provides support to restock carp in reservoirs, supports the Koran restocking program, and pilots a program to test the aquaculture of new marine and fresh water species such as tilapia and shrimp. The third component finances legal training and assistance for preparing technical documents, provides legal assitance to support the Fisheries Directorate, supports a fisheries management information system, and prepares a business plan for the Fishery Research Institute."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":26},"theme1":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme4":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"5,600,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"AL","sectorcode":"TP,AJ,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development"],"themecode":"77,85,57,76,84","mjthemecode":"11,10,7,11,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Rural non-farm income generation","code":"76"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":45},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":29},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":26}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20080703000654","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20080703000654","DocDate":"12-FEB-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201274305","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201274305","DocDate":"08-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201274305","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201274305","DocURL":"08-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02021604052431","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02021604052431","DocDate":"31-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01080104004623","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01080104004623","DocDate":"30-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00030205382877","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00030205382877","DocDate":"05-SEP-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062315373736","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062315373736","DocDate":"11-AUG-2000"}],"countryname":"Republic of Albania"}},"facets":{}}
