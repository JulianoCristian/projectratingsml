Fishing is the most important primary activity in the Maldivian economy. In order to maintain this industry, the project will: 1) increase fish production, government revenue, and foreign exchange earnings at a lower processing cost; 2) increase the income of fishing households to alleviate relative poverty; 3) reduce migration to the capital city, Male, through balanced regional growth; and 4) create the environment for increased private sector participation in the fisheries sector. The Third Fisheries Project will meet these goals by: 1) constructing a port at Kooddoo in Gaafu Alifu in Southern Maldives for fishing boats and collector vessels; 2) building a fish freezing/cold storage complex on the same island; 3) strengthening the atoll wide fish collection system; and 4) providing technical assistance. These new improvements will help to strengthen the fishing industry of Maldives."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Maldives!$!MV","sector1":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":52},"sector2":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":13},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":12},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":11},"theme1":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"MV","sectorcode":"YA,BC,AB,AJ,TP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Financial and private sector development","Rural development"],"themecode":"77,44,74","mjthemecode":"9,4,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":52},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":13},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":12},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":12},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":11}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3980804142624","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980804142624","DocDate":"10-JUN-1998"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090121571072","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121571072","DocURL":"20-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090121571072","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090121571072","DocDate":"20-APR-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e39436_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e39436_1_0","DocDate":"07-JAN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001215154","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001215154","DocDate":"21-NOV-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Maldives"}},"facets":{}}
