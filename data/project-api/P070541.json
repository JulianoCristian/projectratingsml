Phase I, the first of three Phases of the NEP, is a preparatory Phase that extends nutrition and growth promotion interventions into rural areas. Also, Phase I aims to consolidate and sustain the results gained with the earlier project--Community Nutrition Project (rep. no. 14004)--which contributed to reversing the negative trend in nutritional status among children under three in the urban areas. The project has three main components. The first consists of five sub-components: 1) growth monitoring and promotion; 2) nutrition and health group education; 3) integrated management of childhood illnesses; 4) basic health services; and 5) fighting the roots of malnutrition. The second component, institutional and organizational capacity building, is an overarching component that will be started in Phase I of the NEP and continue throughout the three Phases. This component has a monitoring and evaluation aspect, which will include a strong emphasis on \"learning by doing\" and the active participation of all stakeholders in sharing information on strengths and taking responsibility for improving weaknesses. The third component comprises program management: The national executive bureau (BEN) will be responsible for the daily management of the NEP. It will ensure financial management, the reporting and auditing systems, and procurement."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":77},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":23},"theme1":{"Name":"Child health","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Population and reproductive health","Percent":13},"theme4":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":25},"theme5":{"Name":"Malaria","Percent":13},"totalcommamt":"14,700,000","sector":[{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"BC,JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"92,68,69,57,63","mjthemecode":"8,7,8,8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Child health","code":"63"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Population and reproductive health","code":"69"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"},{"name":"Malaria","code":"92"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":77},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":23}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070215115249","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070215115249","DocDate":"29-JAN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201281228","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201281228","DocURL":"29-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201281228","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201281228","DocDate":"29-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02022804005262","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022804005262","DocDate":"20-FEB-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02022104015570","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02022104015570","DocDate":"13-FEB-2002"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
