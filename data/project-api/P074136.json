Additional objectives are to improve the financial management system of the Electric Power Company of Serbia (EPS) and to support the Serbian Ministry of Mining and Energy in preparing an Energy Policy Statement and drafting a new Energy Law. There are three project components. The first two components provide support for increasing available generating capacity through repairing the thermal power plant Kostalac A; and improving the reliability of the transmission network by reinforcing the transmission substation Sremska Mitrovica, which is key for importing electricity and reliably operating a high votage power grid. The third component funds the design, supply, and installation of a computer-based financial management system in EPS. An interim project specific financial management system has been established at EPS during the project's appraisal. This interim system will be incorporated into the new FMS. Additionally, the component provides technical assistance, specifically financing consulting services to the Serbian Ministry of Mining and Energy and to EPS: these services focus on reforming the energy sector legal and regulatory framework and on restructuring the energy market and sector enterprises. Auditing will also be funded."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Serbia!$!YF","sector1":{"Name":"Power","Percent":98},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":2},"theme1":{"Name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":28},"theme4":{"Name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","Percent":29},"totalcommamt":"6,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"YF","sectorcode":"BC,LD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"58,27,39,34","mjthemecode":"3,4,2,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Legal institutions for a market economy","code":"34"},{"name":"Infrastructure services for private sector development","code":"39"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","code":"58"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":98},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":2}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020439_20070821115145","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20070821115145","DocDate":"22-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2010042309381633","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010042309381633","DocDate":"23-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051410072030","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051410072030","DocDate":"15-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051410083131","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051410083131","DocDate":"15-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010051410105532","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010051410105532","DocDate":"15-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01080804021322","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01080804021322","DocDate":"25-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0106080416252","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0106080416252","DocDate":"01-JUN-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Serbia"}},"facets":{}}
