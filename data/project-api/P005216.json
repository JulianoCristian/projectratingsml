The project will reduce the health risks posed by sewage overflows onto streets and will minimize water logging and flooding problems in the low-income areas to the south of the city. The project includes two major subprojects, namely a trunk tunnel and lateral drains and appurtenances, which are required to intercept rainwater runoff collected in the central part of Tehran; and a main interceptor and outfall system consisting of a tunnel, an open channel, a retention reservoir, and a pipe outfall to the Kan River. The system will protect the central part of Tehran and the low-lying areas to the south of the city from frequent floods."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Iran!$!IR","sector1":{"Name":"Flood protection","Percent":95},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Municipal governance and institution building","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Natural disaster management","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Other urban development","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"77,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Flood protection"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"IR","sectorcode":"BC,WD","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development","Environment and natural resources management","Social protection and risk management","Urban development"],"themecode":"74,52,85,73","mjthemecode":"9,11,6,9","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Flood protection","code":"WD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Municipal governance and institution building","code":"73"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Natural disaster management","code":"52"},{"name":"Other urban development","code":"74"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":95},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20041216093519","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20041216093519","DocDate":"11-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_01072104005585","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01072104005585","DocDate":"04-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122514453","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122514453","DocURL":"05-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122514453","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122514453","DocDate":"05-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122512551","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122512551","DocDate":"05-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122514252","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122514252","DocURL":"05-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122512551","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122512551","DocURL":"05-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122514252","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122514252","DocDate":"05-JUN-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002165515","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002165515","DocDate":"05-MAY-1992"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Iran"}},"facets":{}}
