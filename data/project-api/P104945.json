The re-structured grant will re-allocate the existing funds from the four northern cities to Maputo. Poor households who cannot afford to pay connection costs are currently excluded from the water network. The purpose of this paper is to restructuring of grant agreement no.TF091213 by modifying the development objectives, revising the components, reallocating the grant proceeds between components, cancelling US$1.0 million, and extending the closing date of the grant from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2014."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Mozambique!$!MZ","sector1":{"Name":"Water
