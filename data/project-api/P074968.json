There are several risks to the implementation of this program posed by the country's indebtedness amd macroeconomic vulnerabilities, the possibility that a newly elected government may be unwilling to sustain the reforms, and constraints due to technical and institutional capacity. However, these risks can be offset by building a strong track record in reform implementation, the government's establishment of institutional and political mechanisms to help continue policies, and instituting technical assistance programs to support all the key areas of reform."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":25},"sector2":{"Name":"Power","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Oil and gas","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"Health","Percent":15},"theme1":{"Name":"Other public sector governance","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"500,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Power"},{"Name":"Oil and gas"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"JA,BH,LC,LD,YZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Energy and mining","code":"LX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Economic management","Public sector governance","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"45,28,24,27,30","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,2,1,2,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Power","code":"LD"},{"name":"Oil and gas","code":"LC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other public sector governance","code":"30"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":25},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20},{"Name":"Energy and mining","Percent":20},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":15}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000160016_20051228094447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20051228094447","DocDate":"19-DEC-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20030627133447","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20030627133447","DocDate":"23-JUN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201295402","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201295402","DocURL":"11-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201295402","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201295402","DocDate":"11-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000094946_02071604053056","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02071604053056","DocDate":"15-MAY-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02042604211142","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02042604211142","DocDate":"12-APR-2002"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
