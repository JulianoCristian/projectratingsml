It is the Government's first effort to control waterlogging and salinity through improved water management.  Besides removing severe water supply constraints by increasing delivery efficiency of canals and watercourses, it will control excessive seepage and provide surface drainage. The main objectives are to: a) increase agricultural productivity and income; b) reduce the need for expensive subsurface drainage and avert related environmentally harmful effects; and c) improve the equity of water distribution.  To achieve these objectives the project will: 1) conserve water by: i) recovering a significant amount of seepage from the larger channels by installing interceptor drains; and ii) preventing seepage from distributaries and minors by providing impervious lining and improving watercourses; 2) provide a network of surface drains in the area to evacuate storm water run off; 3) carry out research on technical and management issues crucial for irrigation and drainage subsectors; 4) provide technical assistance to ensure adequate back-up for implementing agencies and train project staff; and 5) monitor and evaluate the project's impact on groundwater tables and agricultural production."},"country_namecode":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan!$!PK","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":40},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":40},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":20},"totalcommamt":"54,200,000","sector":[{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Agreement,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"PK","sectorcode":"AI","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,78,85","mjthemecode":"11,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123303535","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123303535","DocURL":"01-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123303636","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123303636","DocDate":"01-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123303535","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123303535","DocDate":"01-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123303737","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123303737","DocURL":"01-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090123303737","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123303737","DocDate":"01-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090123303636","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090123303636","DocURL":"01-OCT-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e12500_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e12500_1_0","DocDate":"02-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e120ff_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e120ff_1_0","DocDate":"02-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e120fd_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e120fd_1_0","DocDate":"02-JUL-1992"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961002150420","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961002150420","DocDate":"11-JUN-1992"}],"countryname":"Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}},"facets":{}}
