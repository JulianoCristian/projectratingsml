The project originally envisioned financing audits, advisory services and Information Technology (IT) systems to strengthen the institutional and operational capacity of the Savings and Settlement Bank (SSC).The ultimate objective was to improve SSCs efficiency in delivering banking and payment services and thus to better fulfill the banking needs of its customers. There are two changes and clarifications in the project first, in accordance with the Borrower's request dated October 2, 2008, it is that some of the unused proceeds of the Credit (SDR 200,000) originally earmarked for consultants' services for the SSC) under the banking system component will be used to fund technical assistance activities related to the privatization of Aiylbank.  The envisioned privatization advisor is retained to assist government throughout the privatization process. Specific support will include conducting a road show to attract potential bidders, determining with the government the best options for the privatization and the timetable, preparing a data room of information for potential bidders to be able to assess Aiylbank, answering their question, managing the bidding process, and assisting the government in assessing the bids and selecting the best one. Second, it is also to add a provision under the Barking system component to enable the project to provide more general technical assistance and support to the reform and modernization of the borrower's banking sector, as described in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). It is expected that these activities, if they materialize, will be minor and could based on a regular reallocation of available credit funds."},"country_namecode":"Kyrgyz
