Inadequate maintenance budget allocations and lack of sufficiently qualified administrative, technical and managerial personnel have caused national and secondary roads to begin to deteriorate. The proposed project will help overcome this situation by financing: (i) the renewal of the maintenance equipment fleet; (ii) the construction of workshops and office buildings; (iii) the incremental cost of fuel, spare parts and materials for routine maintenance; (iv) the costs of fuel, spare parts and materials for the periodic maintenance of about 450 km of gravel roads; (v) the rehabilitation of about 280 km of gravel roads; (vi) the resealing of about 320 km of paved roads; (vii) the construction and initial maintenance of about 1,640 km of new and existing feeder roads; and (viii) technical assistance, consultants, training and scholarships to help overcome personnel constraints."},"country_namecode":"Burkina Faso!$!BF","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Highways","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"46,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Highways"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"BF","sectorcode":"TH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Highways","code":"TH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000333038_20081127040944","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20081127040944","DocDate":"30-JUN-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081e042f1_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e042f1_1_0","DocDate":"16-JUN-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902375425","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902375425","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912523799","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912523799","DocDate":"31-MAY-1981"}],"countryname":"Burkina Faso"}},"facets":{}}
