The project's key objective is to modernize and improve the quality of primary and lower secondary education. Its four components consist of curriculum development, textbook production and financing, learning assessment, and in-service teacher training. The first component, curriculum development, comprises (1) establishing an integrated institutional structure for curriculum development and assessment/evaluation, (2) developing and establishing updated subject curricula for grades 1-9, and (3) supporting teachers with the implementation of the new curriculum. The learning assessment component improves the assessment and examination system in five key areas: (1) integrating assessment objectives into the new curriculum; (2) improving key national examinations at grades 4 and 9; (3) developing and disseminating assessment materials to teachers for key subjects; (4) training trainers in the use of these materials; and (5) conducting a sample-based survey of student achievements to compare performance before and after the project's implementation. The teacher training component will finance technical assistance, development and dissemination of training materials, implementation of centralized courses for trainers and decentralized courses for teachers, and provide necessary equipment. The textbook development and financing component will finance producing new textbooks and textbook guides in the mother tongue for core subjects for grades 3-9; support a new cost recovery system for textbooks; and provide training and technical assistance for Ministry staff, textbook evaluation committees, and publishers in competitive bidding procedures. Finally, the project will finance technical assistance, equipment and incremental operating "},"country_namecode":"Republic of Moldova!$!MD","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":42},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":42},"sector3":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":15},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":25},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":50},"theme3":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"16,800,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MD","sectorcode":"BC,ET,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,65,25","mjthemecode":"2,8,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":42},{"Name":"Education","Percent":42},{"Name":"Education","Percent":15},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20050303094829","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050303094829","DocDate":"24-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000009265_3980420172204","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420172204","DocDate":"05-SEP-1997"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3980420170717","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3980420170717","DocDate":"21-MAR-1997"}],"countryname":"Republic of Moldova"}},"facets":{}}
