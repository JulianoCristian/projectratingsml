(POWERGRID) institutional development, as well as its financial and commercial performance. The components include system coordination, and control in the Eastern, and Western regions, featuring the involvement of their respective State Electricity Boards, under a unified approach to upgrade load dispatch centers, and facilities, while improving operations of state systems, to effectively participate in the operation of regional grids, through a three tier coordination : supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) at the field level; energy management system (EMS) at the state, and regional levels; and, at required telecommunication facilities. Major POWERGRID investments focus on transmission system development, covering inter-regional transmission links, to interconnect India's power regions, and build a functional national grid, connecting power stations to the grid. Additionally, power system improvement programs will be developed, while some transmission projects will be implemented directly by private joint ventures. Technical assistance and training will be provided to strengthen institutional development, and, assess potential diversification into telecommunications."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
