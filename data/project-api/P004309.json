The project will establish three polytechnic institutes near industrial areas.  The institutes will provide about 13,000 additional training places.  The project will also promote a more decentralized, demand-driven polytechnic system through the implementation of reforms in policies and organizational structures.  Associated with these reforms the project will increase the efficiency of the polytechnic system.  To provide the required personnel to staff the institutes, the project will train about 1000 new teachers and instructors and 36 administrators.  At the national level, the project will provide technical assistance to improve the project implementation and management capacity of the development and supply division and the Technical and Vocational Education Division.  The project will also provide technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Human Resources to implement the Human Resources Development Fund and the National Vocational Training Council to conduct national planning and labor related research."},"country_namecode":"Malaysia!$!MY","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":99},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"107,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"MY","sectorcode":"BC,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"66,25","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":99},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_0011010531200","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0011010531200","DocDate":"15-JUN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122571684","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122571684","DocURL":"07-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122571684","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122571684","DocDate":"07-APR-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961004065550","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004065550","DocDate":"19-FEB-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961004065403","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961004065403","DocDate":"19-FEB-1993"}],"countryname":"Malaysia","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
