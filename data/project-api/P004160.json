Agreed criteria will be strictly applied to the selection of participating hospitals and of equipment. The selection criteria for hospitals will consider the hospital's financial status, its location, its size, and the need for and potential efficient utilization of the requested equipment. The selection of the biomedical equipment will take into consideration the regional distribution among the eight medical regions, the relevance of equipment to medical needs, training of equipment users, availability of a recurrent cost budget for operating the equipment, and sharing of equipment by several facilities. The financing of high cost equipment will be excluded from the project, partly because there is an active leasing market for this type of equipment, and partly because some procedures are not reimbursable by the national insurance and will therefore not be accessible to the poor."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Korea!$!KR","sector1":{"Name":"Health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"0","sector":[{"Name":"Health"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"KR","sectorcode":"JA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Human development"],"themecode":"67,89","mjthemecode":"8,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Health","code":"JA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Injuries and non-communicable diseases","code":"89"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019122739","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019122739","DocDate":"28-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090122443470","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122443470","DocURL":"19-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090122443470","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090122443470","DocDate":"19-JUL-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3961001043221","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001043221","DocDate":"24-APR-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961001042952","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961001042952","DocDate":"24-APR-1991"}],"countryname":"Republic of Korea"}},"facets":{}}
