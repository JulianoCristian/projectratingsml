There are four project components. The first component finances the creation of a specialized department in the Jordan Export Development and Commercial Centers Corporation (JEDCO) focusing solely on the promotion of horticultural exports. It also provides limited support to the Agricultural Marketing Department (AMD) in its role on collecting and relaying market prices to farmers, collecting statistics on production and export volumes, lobbying for export-friendly policies, and regulatory functions. The second component finances adaptive technology development and transfer, capacity buildigng for small and medium scale farmers, and technology transfer specialists. The third component supports quality testing and certification of export produce. The fourth component funds the project coordination unit."},"country_namecode":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan!$!JO","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":35},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":17},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":17},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":33},"theme4":{"Name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","Percent":17},"theme5":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":16},"totalcommamt":"5,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"JO","sectorcode":"BC,AB,YA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Rural development","Trade and integration","Financial and private sector development","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"48,43,45,75,49","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"5,10,5,4,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade facilitation and market access","code":"49"},{"name":"Rural markets","code":"75"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization","code":"43"},{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":45},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":35},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080827011656","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080827011656","DocDate":"28-JUL-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02050904025179","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02050904025179","DocDate":"18-SEP-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010031815372809","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010031815372809","DocDate":"02-AUG-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02080704010037","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02080704010037","DocDate":"25-JUN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02051004123439","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02051004123439","DocDate":"03-MAY-2002"}],"countryname":"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
