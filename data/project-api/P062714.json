The project components are: 1) To support the rehabilitation, improvement, and protection of spate irrigation infrastructure, namely Tuban and Zabid schemes, topographical surveys, with detailed design, and hydraulic models testing will be implemented, with supervision on improvements of irrigation systems at the canal level, including wadi levels. This include construction of flood protection, and road rehabilitation works. 2) To enhance irrigation, and environment management, a participatory irrigation management approach will be established, that is, through water users associations (WUA), and a scheme water users federation, with joint management mechanisms, should provide institutional support. Operation and maintenance equipment will be provided, to be leased by the WUAs, and, supported by groundwater, and hydraulic monitoring. 3) An intensive agriculture demonstration program will provide improved agricultural practices, through extension services in technology transfer. 4) Institutional strengthening, and capacity building will support the relevant institutions in the irrigation sector, including legal framework support."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Yemen!$!RY","sector1":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":49},"sector2":{"Name":"General public administration
