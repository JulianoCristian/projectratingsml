There are three main components. The first has four sub-components: it 1) provides incentives for the installation of improved manure storage facilities and equipment for manure collection and application in the seven comunas; 2) promotes the adoption of better agricultural practices to improve agricultural production while reducing nutrient discharge pollution for agriculture; 3) develops and supports a specific land use management plan for the Boianu-Sticleanu Polder and ecological restoration of the Calderasi-Raul Polder; and 4) strengthens capacity in Calarasi Judet and the public health directorate to monitor soil and water quality and environmental impacts. The second component strengthens national policy and regulatory capacity. The third component finances a broad public information campaign of the project's activities and benefits at the local, national, and regional levels to achieve replicability of project interventions."},"country_namecode":"Romania!$!RO","sector1":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":73},"sector2":{"Name":"Forestry","Percent":9},"sector3":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":8},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":5},"sector5":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":5},"theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Land administration and management","Percent":11},"theme3":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Other rural development","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":23},"totalcommamt":"5,150,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Forestry"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement","countrycode":"RO","sectorcode":"BH,BC,EZ,AT,AB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"themecode":"84,79,82,83,85","mjthemecode":"11,11,11,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Forestry","code":"AT"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Land administration and management","code":"83"},{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Other rural development","code":"79"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":73},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":9},{"Name":"Education","Percent":8},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":5}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333038_20080828010723","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20080828010723","DocDate":"28-DEC-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052715193278","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052715193278","DocDate":"16-JAN-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01120104051660","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01120104051660","DocDate":"25-OCT-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_01082905092512","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01082905092512","DocDate":"23-AUG-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00011905350872","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00011905350872","DocDate":"17-MAY-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052715110527","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052715110527","DocDate":"09-FEB-2000"}],"countryname":"Romania"}},"facets":{}}
