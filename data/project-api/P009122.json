The project supports five components: 1) the seed industry component supports the creation of private seed companies to process and market about 25,000 tons of planting seed produced by private seed companies in association with privatized seed farms; 2) the cotton marketing component supports the introduction of cotton grading technology to determine the characteristics of Uzbek cotton in conformity with internationally recognized standards; 3) the integrated pest management component provides for equipment and technical assistance for the development of insect rearing and dispersal technologies that will allow the country to economically broaden biological control of cotton pests; 4) the irrigation component provides for equipment and training to introduce irrigation scheduling technology and demonstrate effective ways to reduce water use in cotton production, while improving land productivity and avoiding water based damage to the environment; and 5) the project management and program design component will help in implementing the project."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Uzbekistan!$!UZ","sector1":{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","Percent":45},"sector2":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":34},"sector3":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"sector4":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":6},"sector5":{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Technology diffusion","Percent":22},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":22},"theme3":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":23},"theme4":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":11},"totalcommamt":"66,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Irrigation and drainage"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"UZ","sectorcode":"AI,AB,BC,YA,AZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Trade and integration","Rural development","Trade and integration","Environment and natural resources management","Financial and private sector development"],"themecode":"40,84,45,77,48","mjthemecode":"5,10,5,11,4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","code":"AZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Irrigation and drainage","code":"AI"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Technology diffusion","code":"48"},{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":45},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":34},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":6},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_03052104025020","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_03052104025020","DocDate":"25-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000112742_20060222155054","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000112742_20060222155054","DocDate":"25-MAR-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090200191496","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200191496","DocURL":"14-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090200191496","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090200191496","DocDate":"14-JUN-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081ea3c5f_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ea3c5f_1_0","DocDate":"25-MAY-1995"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019100938","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019100938","DocDate":"02-MAY-1995"}],"countryname":"Republic of Uzbekistan"}},"facets":{}}
