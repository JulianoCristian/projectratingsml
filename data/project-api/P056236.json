The first component will support the Government's efforts to restructure system governance, and management, so that conditions are in place to support improved sector efficiency, and quality. Specifically, the component includes reforming legislation governing higher education; rationalizing funding allocation practices - financing international technical assistance for resource allocation across higher institutions; establishing a national quality assurance council, guided by technical assistance in establishing the performance standards for an accredited system of higher education. Management training, and capacity building will be financed, as will the establishment of an integrated management information system, and of a project fund for higher education institutions to improve teaching/learning abilities. The second component will improve the quality, and relevance of university education, through the establishment of an information technology (IT) integrated computer, and network infrastructure, and finance in-service training to develop competencies in the application of computer technology, particularly in teaching methodologies. Finally, the third component will improve the quality, and relevance of mid-level technical education, by consolidating middle technical institutes into technical colleges, designing relevant curriculum, and training instruction, and, strengthening academic administration and management."},"country_namecode":"Arab Republic of Egypt!$!EG","sector1":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":49},"sector2":{"Name":"Law and justice","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":18},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":13},"theme1":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Other financial and private sector development","Percent":25},"theme3":{"Name":"Law reform","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"50,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Tertiary education"},{"Name":"Law and justice"},{"Name":"Vocational training"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"EG","sectorcode":"BC,EV,BG,ET","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Financial and private sector development","Rule of law"],"themecode":"33,44,66","mjthemecode":"8,4,3","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"},{"name":"Law and justice","code":"BG"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Other financial and private sector development","code":"44"},{"name":"Law reform","code":"33"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":49},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":18},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":13}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000386194_20110701052124","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20110701052124","DocDate":"22-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000333037_20090821023835","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20090821023835","DocDate":"05-JUN-2009"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201501670","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201501670","DocURL":"23-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010052116124051","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010052116124051","DocDate":"23-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090201501670","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201501670","DocDate":"23-APR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_02033004305220","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02033004305220","DocDate":"07-MAR-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_01121708452545","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01121708452545","DocDate":"11-DEC-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_00051105314021","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00051105314021","DocDate":"03-MAY-2000"}],"countryname":"Arab Republic of Egypt"}},"facets":{}}
