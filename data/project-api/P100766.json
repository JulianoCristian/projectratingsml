KDP consists of a facilitated planning process that lets communities identify their own priorities, which are then funded through a block grant transferred directly to a bank account owned by all of the villages within the kecamatan. Fifty percent of the funding for the proposed project will come through an Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) grant, and the other 50 percent will be provided by the Government of Indonesia from national (APBN) funding. Building on an existing project allows the program to get off to a fast start. To keep the program manageable, it is divided into 4 windows. The first window, the housing window, will be initially confined to the four or five affected kecamatans in each of Nias's two kabupaten, for a total of 9 kecamatans and approximately 84 villages (see Annex l), although some slight adjustment to these numbers is likely to happen during final design allocations. Project facilitators will work with communities to prepare full village maps that show damage, reconstruction programs, and uncovered needs; These will be the basis for each reconstruction plan. Funding covers 5,000 housing units in these 8-9 kecamatans. The second window is for schools, UNICEF has already targeted reconstruction for the 120 priority schools that were affected by the tsunami. This project will work with UNICEF and the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency for NAD & Nias (BRR) to define the next 100 priority schools (primary and junior secondary) using the same needs criteria. It will include an associated school quality improvement program. The third window will help village and kecamatan governments rebuild and equip their offices,"},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Other social development","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"25,750,000","sector":[{"Name":"Other social services"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Status and Results Report,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"JB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"61,62","mjthemecode":"7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other social development","code":"62"},{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000356161_20120423024040","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120423024040","DocDate":"30-DEC-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISRR","EntityID":"0000A8056_2011051606342988","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011051606342988","DocDate":"16-MAY-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000310607_20070104123902","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070104123902","DocDate":"05-DEC-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000310607_20070104140448","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20070104140448","DocDate":"04-DEC-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000310607_20061116170441","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000310607_20061116170441","DocDate":"07-NOV-2006"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
