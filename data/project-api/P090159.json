The Development Grant Agreement (H-1430-HA) was signed on January 6, 2005 and the project became effective on June 1, 2005. The closing date is scheduled for December 31,2008. The project development objective of the ERDMP, as stated in the Development Grant Agreement is to support the GoH in the (i) rehabilitation of areas affected by recent adverse natural events, (ii) strengthening of the country's capacity to manage natural disaster risks and to better respond to emergencies resulting from adverse natural events; and (iii) reduction of the vulnerability of communities through risk mitigation activities. The goal is to bolster the environmental and social decision making framework so that the selected rehabilitation and risk mitigation micro-projects are environmentally sustainable. The updated Environmental Management Plan (EMP) will define the means of improving the impact of the sub-projects on the environment."},"country_namecode":"Republic of
