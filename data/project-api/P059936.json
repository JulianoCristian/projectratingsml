To this end, the components will assess community participation to identify development priorities, focused on the development of rural transport, and market networks, by connecting the administrative center to the road system. Construction of new, and upgraded existing rural roads will be financed in district-to-commune roads; in commune-to-village roads; and, in village-to-village roads; and, in addition, facilities for rural markets will be financed. Capacity building will be provided to support the Ministry of Transport, and local authorities. Additionally, and following the participatory approach, small-scale irrigation systems, rural water supply, and agriculture development will be financed, to include an agricultural program of applied demonstrations and training, and an on-site research program; irrigation schemes will serve a total of 12,500 hectares of paddy fields; while water supply infrastructure will build drinking water schemes, with designs relating both to available water sources, and to cultural preferences of ethnic groups. Furthermore, the project will facilitate the development of education and health systems, through improved access to, and delivery of primary education, construction of schools, and improved teacher qualifications; while increased health service provision will focus on basic equipment, and medicine supply, as well as on improved information, training, and communication activities. Community development budgets, planning and management, and institutional capacity building will be funded based on community priorities."},"country_namecode":"Socialist Republic of
