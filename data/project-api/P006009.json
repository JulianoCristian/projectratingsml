The project will strengthen agricultural services through investment in physical facilities, institutional development, training and technical assistance activites.  Specifically the project will: (a) strengthen animal disease control through construction of a reference laboratory, a quarantine station and promotion of intensive vaccination programs; (b) strengthen phytosanitary programs to create and maintain plant disease- and insect pest- free zones; (c) improve wool grading and classification to improve market transparency; (d) strengthen analysis and monitoring of maximum sustainable fish catches; (e) promote export of higher value-added meat products; (f) improve research on wool, biotechnology, post-harvest physiology of fruits and vegetables, and forest plantation management; (g) provide specialized training and technical assistance to strengthen technical and marketing skills in the Meat Board and Fisheries Institute; and (h) assist the private sector to venture into new export markets by partially financing marketing studies, technical assistance, and overseas visits and export promotions."},"country_namecode":"Argentine Republic!$!AR","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":43},"sector2":{"Name":"Crops","Percent":19},"sector3":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":19},"sector4":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":15},"sector5":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Other communicable diseases","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":67},"totalcommamt":"33,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Crops"},{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Loan Agreement,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"AR","sectorcode":"AB,YA,AJ,AH,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Human development","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"45,64","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"8,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Crops","code":"AH"},{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other communicable diseases","code":"64"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":43},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":19},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":19},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":15},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000094946_9906190530223","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9906190530223","DocDate":"19-MAY-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Grant or Trust Fund Agreement (GTA),  Vol.","DocType":"GTA","EntityID":"000114496_2010062512495542","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010062512495542","DocDate":"17-MAY-1993"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032411365743","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032411365743","DocDate":"13-AUG-1991"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3960930024029","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960930024029","DocDate":"29-JAN-1991"}],"countryname":"Argentine Republic","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
