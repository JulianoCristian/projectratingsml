The project will finance KIK lending, for about two and one half years, in the provinces of East and Central Java and West Sumatera. Approximately 10,000 subloans will be made by handling banks for productive activities in virtually all sectors of the economy. Technical assistance will involve the strengthening of KIK/KMKP program supervision, the establishment of three Provincial Project Management Units, training of Bank Indonesia and handling banks' staff, a study of the credit insurance system, an evaluation study of the project's impact, and a study of handling banks' total administrative and financial costs under the program."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Indonesia!$!ID","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"40,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Financial sector development"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report,Project Agreement,Agreement","countrycode":"ID","sectorcode":"FS","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"}],"mjthemecode":"4","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"4"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Financial sector development","code":"FS"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Finance","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902301016","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902301016","DocDate":"31-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912101333","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912101333","DocDate":"31-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081df56c3_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081df56c3_1_0","DocDate":"30-MAR-1978"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (AGR),  Vol.","DocType":"AGR","EntityID":"090224b082228ba5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082228ba5_1_0","DocDate":"30-MAR-1978"}],"countryname":"Republic of Indonesia"}},"facets":{}}
