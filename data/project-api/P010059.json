The next major step in the power development program, to be included in the present project, is the second stage development of the Maskeliya River which will add 90MW of hydro capacity to the system. It is unlikely that this capacity can be commissioned before late 1972 and to meet the deficit in energy, which will arise towards the end of 1971 and persist throughout 1972, the project will also include a 25MW gas turbine generating unit to be installed adjacent to the existing Grandpass steam power station in Colombo. System requirements could then be met until early 1974. Thereafter additional generating requirements are expected to be met by the development of the Mahaweli River."},"country_namecode":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan!$!LK","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"21,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Hydro"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"LK","sectorcode":"PH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","code":"PX"}],"mjthemecode":"2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Hydro","code":"PH"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912565725","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912565725","DocDate":"07-DEC-1981"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101903161940","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903161940","DocDate":"31-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e67ec6_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ec6_1_0","DocDate":"22-JUL-1969"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e67ec5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e67ec5_1_0","DocDate":"22-JUL-1969"}],"countryname":"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lan"}},"facets":{}}
