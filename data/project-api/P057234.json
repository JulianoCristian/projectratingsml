The Eastern Arc component was appraised separately from the main project due to timing of the GEF approval process, which has necessitated the separate  processing of  the grant component. This third component of  the program, which is largely to be financed by GEF (and possibly with bilateral  sources) has been jointly developed and implemented by the World Bank and UNDP working with  Government and other partners with interests in the forestry sector. This component will support  institutional reform, strategy development, pilot community-based conservation, and the development of   sustainable financing for tropical high forest conservation in Tanzania. The main global environmental objective of  this GEF activity is  to promote the sustainable conservation  and management of  the Eastem Arc forests. The activity has four sub-components: subcomponent (i)  will be implemented by the World Bank with IDA resources; subcomponent (ii) will also be implemented  by the World Bank with GEF grant resources; sub-components (iii) and (iv) will be implemented through  UNDP with GEF grant resources. Subcomponent 1 finances institutional reforms for forest biodiversity conservation, in particular of the Eastern Arc  forests at central, district and local partnership levels to incorporate specific responsibilities for  biodiversity conservation, oversight, monitoring and coordination. Such reforms will be linked  with other reforms and institutional restructuring proposed for the forestry sector as a whole,  which are to be financed by IDA. The implementing agency for this sub-component would be  the Bank.
