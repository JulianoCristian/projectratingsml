Achievement of these objectives would be supported by (a) the construction and expansion of health care facilities, water systems and latrines; (b) a training program; (c) the implementation of timely information systems on service statistics and cost data; and (d) a set of policy and research studies. The project is expected to reduce mortality and morbidity of women of childbearing age, infants and children, to increase contraceptive prevalence and make significant changes in the way the health sector is organized and provides services."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Colombia!$!CO","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"36,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Basic health"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","countrycode":"CO","sectorcode":"HB","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","code":"HX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Basic health","code":"HB"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"","Percent":0}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3961007074529","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961007074529","DocDate":"30-SEP-1994"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000009265_3970625095121","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3970625095121","DocDate":"31-JUL-1985"}],"countryname":"Republic of Colombia"}},"facets":{}}
