Specifically, the project pilot-tests whether Vanuatu can effectively deliver a package of innovations intended to help the country move toward its objective of Education for All, defined as formal basic education of good quality through year 8. There are two main project components. The first comprises five sub-components: It expands access to primary school and increases educational quality by improving community participation through annual community consultations, and enlisting community support to construct or repair pre-schools, repair primary-year classrooms, and construct housing for community secondary school teachers. This component also strengthens collaborative relationships with parents, teachers, and other community members to upgrade educational quality; partners with nongovernmental organizations to operate pre-schools in pilot communities; provides educational equipment and learning materials; and builds community secondary schools. The second component funds capacity enhancement with technical assistance for vernacular language development, curriculum development, teacher training, and project and sector management, the latter to include policy and program studies, school mapping, and site and facility surveys."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Vanuatu!$!VU","sector1":{"Name":"Primary education","Percent":53},"sector2":{"Name":"Secondary education","Percent":16},"sector3":{"Name":"Pre-primary education","Percent":16},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":11},"sector5":{"Name":"Tertiary education","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Social analysis and monitoring","Percent":11},"theme2":{"Name":"Education for all","Percent":23},"theme3":{"Name":"Education for the knowledge economy","Percent":22},"theme4":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":22},"theme5":{"Name":"Indigenous peoples","Percent":22},"totalcommamt":"3,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Primary education"},{"Name":"Secondary education"},{"Name":"Pre-primary education"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Tertiary education"}],"docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation,Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document","countrycode":"VU","sectorcode":"ET,BC,EC,ES,EP","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Social dev/gender/inclusion","Human development","Human development","Social dev/gender/inclusion","Social dev/gender/inclusion"],"themecode":"60,57,66,65,61","mjthemecode":"7,8,8,7,7","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"},{"name":"Social dev/gender/inclusion","code":"7"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Primary education","code":"EP"},{"name":"Secondary education","code":"ES"},{"name":"Pre-primary education","code":"EC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Tertiary education","code":"ET"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Social analysis and monitoring","code":"61"},{"name":"Education for all","code":"65"},{"name":"Education for the knowledge economy","code":"66"},{"name":"Participation and civic engagement","code":"57"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","code":"60"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Education","Percent":53},{"Name":"Education","Percent":16},{"Name":"Education","Percent":16},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":11},{"Name":"Education","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Note on Cancelled Operation (PCN),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCN","EntityID":"000090341_20060109101330","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20060109101330","DocDate":"06-JAN-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99072205195166","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99072205195166","DocDate":"22-JUN-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_01062604022122","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_01062604022122","DocDate":"19-JUN-2001"}],"countryname":"Republic of Vanuatu"}},"facets":{}}
