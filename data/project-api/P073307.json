The project is expected to achieve this objective by: a) supporting policy reform to create an enabling environment for the growth of a competitive fertilizer sector; b) supporting institutional strengthening and human resource development; c) promoting increased, efficient and environmentally safe use of fertilizers by the largest possible number of farmers; d) addressing fertilizer supply-side constraints; and e) promoting initiatives to maintain and improve the long-term fertility of the Ethiopian soils and ensuring environmental conservation. By the end of the project period, it is envisaged that Ethiopia's fertilizer sector would have moved from a state controlled to a largely liberalized system with active participation of private sector importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers in a progressively competitive price and trade environment. This, in turn, is expected to contribute significantly to enhanced food security at the national and household levels, improved management of the Ethiopian soils and the strengthening of fertilizer related institutions."},"country_namecode":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia!$!ET","sector1":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":93},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":4},"sector3":{"Name":"Petrochemicals and fertilizers","Percent":2},"sector4":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":1},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":34},"theme2":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Nutrition and food security","Percent":33},"totalcommamt":"44,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"},{"Name":"Petrochemicals and fertilizers"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Information Document,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"ET","sectorcode":"BC,YD,AB,YA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Human development"],"themecode":"68,84,82","mjthemecode":"11,11,8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"},{"name":"Petrochemicals and fertilizers","code":"YD"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"},{"name":"Nutrition and food security","code":"68"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":93},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":4},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":2},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":1}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_0105110432043","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_0105110432043","DocDate":"30-APR-2001"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000009265_3961019095858","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3961019095858","DocDate":"24-APR-1995"}],"countryname":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia"}},"facets":{}}
