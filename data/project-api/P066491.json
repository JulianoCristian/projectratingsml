The Water Supply Rehabilitation Project is regarded as a forerunner of the Municipal water and Wastewater Project currently under preparation. The latter project will introduce private sector participation into Albania's water sector in the form of a management/lease contract. The Water Supply Urgent Rehabilitation Project bridges the gap between the present situation and the Municipal Water and Wastewater Project by taking over the private operator in one or two years. The project rehabilitates components of the water supply systems which are prone to failure and/or which are causing extremely high operation costs or health risk due to their state of disrepair. There are twelve project components. The first three build new wells and valve chambers, improve the pumping station and the pressure break tank, and conduct a feasibility study in rural areas of Durres. Components 4 and 5 upgrade well fields and distribution mains for Fier. Components 6 and 7 replace distribution mains, wells, and pumping stations for Lezhe. Component 8 replaces gravity transmission mains and feeder mains to Saranda. Component 9 repairs water leaks for all cities. Component 10 procures consultant services. Component 11 provides a consultant to all cities to enhance network analysis and operation."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":75},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","Percent":100},"totalcommamt":"10,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Central government administration"}],"docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Agreement,Agreement,Credit Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"AL","sectorcode":"BC,WC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"}],"mjtheme":["Urban development"],"themecode":"71","mjthemecode":"9,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Urban services and housing for the poor","code":"71"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":75},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PPAR","EntityID":"000012009_20050310112902","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20050310112902","DocDate":"14-FEB-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000009486_20040901124421","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009486_20040901124421","DocDate":"24-AUG-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201112017","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201112017","DocURL":"18-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201112218","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201112218","DocURL":"18-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201112419","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201112419","DocURL":"18-APR-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_00021805401161","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_00021805401161","DocDate":"27-JAN-2000"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_99092312395948","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_99092312395948","DocDate":"17-NOV-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Albania"}},"facets":{}}
