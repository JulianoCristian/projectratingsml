Ultimately, the project will reduce discharge of organic matter, a major cause of environmental problems in the Baltic Sea. Project activities are directly linked to the implementation of the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Program; and also supports Poland's move towards compliance with its national policies, European Union (EU) directives, and international agreements. The project has two main components. The first involves farm environmental improvements and consists of specially-trained agri-environmental advisors who will work with eligible farmers to develop farm management plans. These plans will consider options for cropping for, tilling, manure spreading, fertilizer application practices, and constructed wetlands, as well as investments such as manure storage facilities, buffer strips, etc. The first component also provides financial support for recommended farm investments. The second component support public awareness programs, project monitoring and management, a replication strategy, and recurrent costs."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":41},"sector2":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":40},"sector3":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":19},"theme1":{"Name":"Environmental policies and institutions","Percent":33},"theme2":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":33},"theme3":{"Name":"Pollution management and environmental health","Percent":34},"totalcommamt":"2,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"AB,FE,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Finance","code":"FX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"84,85,82","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"11,11,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Micro- and SME finance","code":"FE"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Environmental policies and institutions","code":"82"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"},{"name":"Pollution management and environmental health","code":"84"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":41},{"Name":"Finance","Percent":40},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":19}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000090341_20041019102139","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000090341_20041019102139","DocDate":"31-MAY-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PAD","EntityID":"000094946_9911240531002","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_9911240531002","DocDate":"04-NOV-1999"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000178830_98101903311788","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101903311788","DocDate":"31-AUG-1999"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
