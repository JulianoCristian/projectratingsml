Recent macroeconomic performance has been favorable, with strong output growth and a rapid decline in unemployment combined with low inflation and external imbalances. Meanwhile, buoyant tax revenues have led to a decline in the fiscal deficit. Growth has been built on a vibrant private sector which now accounts for three-quarters of the economy. High growth in domestic consumption reflects the rapid increase in living standards for most Polish citizens. Likewise, poverty levels have decreased and are now concentrated in rural areas and among the long-term unemployed. But the reform momentum has slowed following EU accession, and the strong growth over the last few years reflects to a significant extent a rebound from the economic downturn in the earlier part of the decade combined with a favorable external environment. The programmatic policy lending program will support the government's plans to enhance the quality and efficiency of public finances, increase the supply of relevant and skilled labor, and strengthen the business environment. The programmatic series will be accompanied by a program of technical cooperation and knowledge sharing to complement and extend existing reform plans and priorities. The policy focus of each operation will be closely aligned with the government's current reform priorities and the political feasibility of specific reforms. The Bank's engagement with Poland on key policy issues provides important experience and knowledge to the Bank as well, which will be relevant for the collaboration with other countries in the region."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Poland!$!PL","sector1":{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","Percent":50},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":25},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":25},"theme1":{"Name":"Tax policy and administration","Percent":23},"theme2":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":15},"theme3":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":15},"theme4":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":16},"theme5":{"Name":"Improving labor markets","Percent":31},"totalcommamt":"1,250,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"PL","sectorcode":"YZ,BC,BE","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Public sector governance","Human development","Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Social protection and risk management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"51,27,40,67,28","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"2,8,4,2,6","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","code":"BE"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Tax policy and administration","code":"28"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Improving labor markets","code":"51"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":50},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":25},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":25}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000442464_20130912095644","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130912095644","DocDate":"25-JUN-2011"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000021321_2009032608493775","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000021321_2009032608493775","DocURL":"23-DEC-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000333037_20081126014849","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20081126014849","DocDate":"20-NOV-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000003596_20080717125711","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000003596_20080717125711","DocDate":"10-JUL-2008"}],"countryname":"Republic of Poland","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
