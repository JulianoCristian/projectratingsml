The reforms supported by the project include: support for the implementation of a new education sector strategy; an expanded effort to combat HIV/AIDS; reforms in the public sector, covering procurement and financial management; tax reform, including improvements in local government tax administration; reforms in the water sector, including introduction of private management; and, restructuring of the sugar sector, including investments designed to lower costs, and restructuring and redundancy efforts, focused on increased productivity. Regardless of project benefits, risks include political factors which could divert attention from the reform policy, limited implementation capacity, limited external resources, and, a high dependency on few export products. However, risks will be mitigated by the continued Bank dialogue with the donor community, and civil society, focused on redressing social concerns through improved governance, and strengthened key institutions."},"country_namecode":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana!$!GY","sector1":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":20},"sector2":{"Name":"Water supply","Percent":20},"sector3":{"Name":"Health","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"General education sector","Percent":20},"sector5":{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","Percent":20},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition policy","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Municipal finance","Percent":14},"theme4":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":29},"theme5":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"12,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Water supply"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General education sector"},{"Name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document","countrycode":"GY","sectorcode":"YA,EZ,JA,WC,BZ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"}],"mjtheme":["Financial and private sector development","Public sector governance","Urban development","Rural development","Environment and natural resources management"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"85,78,72,27,40","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"4,2,9,10,11","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Financial and private sector development","code":"4"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Urban development","code":"9"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Environment and natural resources management","code":"11"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Water supply","code":"WC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General education sector","code":"EZ"},{"name":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","code":"YA"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Regulation and competition policy","code":"40"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Municipal finance","code":"72"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"},{"name":"Water resource management","code":"85"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":20},{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":20},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":20},{"Name":"Education","Percent":20},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20060322110532","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20060322110532","DocDate":"12-MAR-2006"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000160016_20040702102853","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20040702102853","DocDate":"14-JUN-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090201330639","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090201330639","DocURL":"21-JAN-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000094946_02112604013510","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02112604013510","DocDate":"20-NOV-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1","DocType":"EA","EntityID":"000094946_02102904033517","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02102904033517","DocDate":"11-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1","DocType":"ISDS","EntityID":"000094946_02101704195476","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02101704195476","DocDate":"08-OCT-2002"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PID","EntityID":"000094946_02102404302176","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000094946_02102404302176","DocDate":"08-OCT-2002"}],"countryname":"Co-operative Republic of Guyana","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
