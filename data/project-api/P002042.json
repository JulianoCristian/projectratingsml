Support services will include extension advice, crop protection measures, improved seeds, fertilizers, and the provision of credit facilities. Physical infrastructure will include construction and improvement of 500 km of feeder and farm roads, the maintenance of these roads, and the establishment of a project headquarters as well as 30 farm service centers. A project management unit with appropriate technical and administrative staff will be established to implement the project. Facilities will be provided for training both agricultural field staff and senior specialists. Consultant services will be engaged to help initiate project start-up activities; carry out a hydrological survey and to assist in establishing a project staff and farmer training program. The project faces only minor risks arising principally from failure to achieve the farmer adoption rate but the basic package is simple and well tested."},"country_namecode":"Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"32,500,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Project Agreement,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement","countrycode":"NG","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902352824","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902352824","DocDate":"31-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e961c0_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961c0_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e961be_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e961be_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.","DocType":"PRA","EntityID":"090224b081e976ba_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976ba_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e976b5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976b5_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAY-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e976b4_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e976b4_1_0","DocDate":"27-MAY-1980"}],"countryname":"Federal Republic of Nigeria"}},"facets":{}}
