Within these broad orientations, the PRSP has four pillars: (i) wealth creation through economic reform and private sector development; (ii) capacity building and development of basic social services; (iii) improving living condition of vulnerable groups; and (iv) implementation of the strategy and monitoring of its outcomes. As noted in the joint staff IMF/World Bank assessment (December 2002), the PRSP suffered from some shortcomings, which the authorities intended to address during the first years of strategy implementation. Among them, it was found that the Government's plans to implement the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) were not spelled out in sufficient details, notably with regard to a fiscal decentralization strategy that would assure better public services. The poverty diagnostic did not benefit from a complete analysis of the new household survey data, and the impact of the specific measures on the well-being of the poor was not analyzed in detail."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Senegal!$!SN","sector1":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":33},"sector2":{"Name":"Health","Percent":29},"sector3":{"Name":"General public administration sector","Percent":22},"sector4":{"Name":"Other social services","Percent":12},"sector5":{"Name":"Vocational training","Percent":4},"theme1":{"Name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","Percent":13},"theme2":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":24},"theme3":{"Name":"Health system performance","Percent":25},"theme4":{"Name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","Percent":13},"theme5":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":25},"totalcommamt":"30,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"Health"},{"Name":"General public administration sector"},{"Name":"Other social services"},{"Name":"Vocational training"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Implementation Completion and Results Report,Credit Agreement,Credit Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"SN","sectorcode":"EV,JB,BZ,JA,BC","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Health and other social services","code":"JX"},{"name":"Education","code":"EX"}],"mjtheme":["Rule of law","Public sector governance","Human development","Social protection and risk management","Public sector governance"],"themecode":"27,54,67,26,32","mjthemecode":"3,2,8,6,2","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rule of law","code":"3"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Human development","code":"8"},{"name":"Social protection and risk management","code":"6"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"Health","code":"JA"},{"name":"General public administration sector","code":"BZ"},{"name":"Other social services","code":"JB"},{"name":"Vocational training","code":"EV"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Judicial and other dispute resolution mechanisms","code":"32"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Health system performance","code":"67"},{"name":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance & Social Care Services","code":"54"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":33},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":29},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":22},{"Name":"Health and other social services","Percent":12},{"Name":"Education","Percent":4}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000334955_20080827034107","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000334955_20080827034107","DocDate":"27-JUN-2008"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000012009_20051110090905","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20051110090905","DocDate":"03-NOV-2005"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000014464_2010030111040544","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111040544","DocURL":"16-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"000014464_2010030111040544","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2010030111040544","DocDate":"16-DEC-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000160016_20041201094233","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20041201094233","DocDate":"12-NOV-2004"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000104615_20040326101116","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20040326101116","DocDate":"09-MAR-2004"}],"countryname":"Republic of Senegal"}},"facets":{}}
