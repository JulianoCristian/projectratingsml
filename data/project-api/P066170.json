The additional loan will help finance the costs associated with the scaling-up of activities to enhance the impact of this project, which has performed well under the ongoing Project. No major changes are proposed to the design or implementation arrangements of the Project. The Additional Financing will continue to support basic, small-scale infrastructure investments for the rural poor while intensifying the focus on creating the conditions for productive, employment and income-generating activities, the proportion of which in the total mix of investments is expected to increase to around half. It would also foster the closer integration of rural development policies, programs and projects at the local level, by mainstreaming the capacity of the existing project-financed Municipal Councils to seek funding from, set priorities for and make decisions concerning the allocation of resources from other State and Federal programs outside the Bank-supported project."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Micro- and SME finance","Percent":60},"sector2":{"Name":"Sub-national government
