In order to achieve this objective, the project aims to assist the Ministry of Agriculture in transforming the existing federal and state veterinary departments into modern, cost-effective services.  To this end, the Livestock Disease Control Project is the first Bank-financed project in Brazil to be directly implemented by the Ministry of agriculture.  It intends to (a) strengthen the Federal Government's Department of Animal Health Protection through recruitment and training of staff, management training, employment of consultant services and purchase of field equipment; (b) strengthen 15 state veterinary services through training and the purchase of equipment; and (c) increase and improve the quality of staff at nine federal laboratories belonging to the Department of Animal Disease Laboratories through staff recruitment, training and the use of consultant services.  Further to this, the project seeks to (d) improve the physical facilities at the nine federal laboratories, one state laboratory in Rio Grande do Sul, the Panamerican Center for Foot-and-Mouth Disease outside Rio and four quarantine stations.  The project would concentrate on cattle, pig and poultry production."},"country_namecode":"Federative Republic of Brazil!$!BR","sector1":{"Name":"Animal production","Percent":46},"sector2":{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research","Percent":54},"theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":50},"theme2":{"Name":"Rural services and infrastructure","Percent":50},"totalcommamt":"51,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Animal production"},{"Name":"Agricultural extension and research"}],"docty":"Loan Agreement","countrycode":"BR","sectorcode":"AB,AJ","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"},{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjtheme":["Rural development","Rural development"],"themecode":"78,77","mjthemecode":"10,10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"},{"name":"Rural development","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Animal production","code":"AJ"},{"name":"Agricultural extension and research","code":"AB"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Rural policies and institutions","code":"77"},{"name":"Rural services and infrastructure","code":"78"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":46},{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":54}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2010032415254622","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2010032415254622","DocDate":"27-JUL-1987"}],"countryname":"Federative Republic of Brazil"}},"facets":{}}
