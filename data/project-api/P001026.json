Through its national component the project will: (a) strengthen the ministry of agriculture by establishing a specialized unit for the planning and coordination of the country's rice development program including consultant assistance and fellowship funds for the training of Guinean cadres; (b) upgrade the country's agronomic rice research in order to provide a testing and demonstration capacity for introducing technical improvements; (c) undertake a pricing study to assist Government to restructure agricultural prices so as to provide appropriate incentives to its rural sector; and (d) prepare for a future agricultural development project in Upper Guinea. The project also contains a regional component, a pilot project to be carried out in Guinea's forest region to test and develop technical improvements to rice cultivation practices of farmers. If the pilot operation is a success, it will constitute the basis for a follow-up project in that area."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Guinea!$!GN","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"10,400,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Project Completion Report,Credit Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"GN","sectorcode":"AA","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","code":"AX"}],"mjthemecode":"10","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"10"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","code":"AA"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960924170955","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960924170955","DocDate":"16-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000333038_20090122000719","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20090122000719","DocDate":"16-MAY-1988"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Credit Agreement (CA),  Vol.","DocType":"CA","EntityID":"090224b081dfd0b5_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dfd0b5_1_0","DocDate":"18-SEP-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_9810190232491","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_9810190232491","DocDate":"31-AUG-1979"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000333038_20100216011922","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20100216011922","DocDate":"17-AUG-1979"}],"countryname":"Republic of Guinea"}},"facets":{}}
