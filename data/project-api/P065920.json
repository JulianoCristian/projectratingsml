The additional grant will help finance: (i) cost overruns associated with the institutional strengthening of the Coastal Municipality Water Utility (CMWU), a water utility in Gaza under a very difficult security situation; and (ii) costs associated with the operations and maintenance of water and wastewater facilities in Gaza Strip for an additional year. The AF will generate financial benefits to the water and wastewater sector in Gaza both directly and indirectly. Increased CMWU capacity will help improve utility financial performance by improving the revenue collection ratio (from 18 percent to 50 percent), and decrease unaccounted for water (from 45 percent to 35 percent) while availability of additional funds will enable CMWU to ensure appropriate levels of maintenance of the water supply and sewerage networks. This will lead to an annual increase in the revenue collection base by US$4.0 million. The AF is to meet overrun costs and will contribute to improving the environment through improved management of existing water and sanitation facilities, increased expenditure on essential operations and maintenance, and a capital investment program to expand and improve water and sanitation infrastructure. The AF will lead to enhancing and improving customer satisfaction through the improvement of the level of services. However, there is a need to provide a communicate progress regularly establishes mechanisms of consultation, handle of complaints, and a transparent and accountable regulatory environment. The AF will lead to the improvement of the water and wastewater services through proper operation and maintenance of the facilities. It will provide water meters, chemicals for treatment and disinfection, rehabilitate of water production wells, mana"},"country_namecode":"West Bank and Gaza!$!GZ","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national
