The program proposes the first of three loans, using a Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan instrument to support short- and medium-term reforms on state decentralization, and economic competitiveness. A single-tranche programmatic loan would be followed by two further single-tranche loans. The first proposed loan has three specific objectives 1) protect fiscal sustainability during Peru's transition to a more decentralized state; 2) assist in strengthening management, and fiscal capacity at sub-national levels for their progressive assumption of service responsibilities; and, 3) support the creation of a better regulatory, and investment environment for upgrading Peru's competitiveness. The subsequent loans will depend on the progress of this initial reform program. An underlying objective of the proposed Loan is to enrich, and extend the government's overall program of accelerated reforms over the past two years. However, risks have been identified in political, economic, financial and technical areas. To mitigate these risks, dialogues with the opposition, and civil society in general, export diversification and competitiveness, the continued strengthening of bank supervision, and a debt management strategy in particular, will outweigh such risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Peru!$!PE","sector1":{"Name":"Sub-national government administration","Percent":40},"sector2":{"Name":"Central government administration","Percent":30},"sector3":{"Name":"General industry and trade sector","Percent":20},"sector4":{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","Percent":10},"theme1":{"Name":"Other economic management","Percent":14},"theme2":{"Name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","Percent":29},"theme3":{"Name":"Decentralization","Percent":29},"theme4":{"Name":"Administrative and civil service reform","Percent":14},"theme5":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":14},"totalcommamt":"150,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"Sub-national government administration"},{"Name":"Central government administration"},{"Name":"General industry and trade sector"},{"Name":"Ports, waterways and shipping"}],"docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report,Loan Agreement,Loan Agreement,Program Document,Program Information Document","countrycode":"PE","sectorcode":"TP,YZ,BC,BH","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","code":"BX"},{"name":"Industry and trade","code":"YX"},{"name":"Transportation","code":"TX"}],"mjtheme":["Economic management","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Public sector governance","Trade and integration"],"ccsa_practice_code":"JOB","themecode":"45,25,26,27,24","combined_practice_name":"Jobs","mjthemecode":"1,2,2,2,5","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"Economic management","code":"1"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Public sector governance","code":"2"},{"name":"Trade and integration","code":"5"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"Sub-national government administration","code":"BH"},{"name":"Central government administration","code":"BC"},{"name":"General industry and trade sector","code":"YZ"},{"name":"Ports, waterways and shipping","code":"TP"}],"theme_namecode":[{"name":"Other economic management","code":"24"},{"name":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","code":"27"},{"name":"Decentralization","code":"26"},{"name":"Administrative and civil service reform","code":"25"},{"name":"Export development and competitiveness","code":"45"}],"source":"IBRD","combined_practice_code":"JOB","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":40},{"Name":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","Percent":30},{"Name":"Industry and trade","Percent":20},{"Name":"Transportation","Percent":10}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR),  Vol.1","DocType":"ICR","EntityID":"000020953_20070718093826","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20070718093826","DocDate":"29-JUN-2007"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (),  Vol.","DocType":"000114496_2004090202204893","EntityID":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202204893","DocURL":"05-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"000114496_2004090202204893","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000114496_2004090202204893","DocDate":"05-DEC-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGD","EntityID":"000012009_20031110111553","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000012009_20031110111553","DocDate":"03-NOV-2003"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1","DocType":"PGID","EntityID":"000160016_20031204144503","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000160016_20031204144503","DocDate":"16-OCT-2003"}],"countryname":"Republic of Peru","ccsa_practice_name":"Jobs"}},"facets":{}}
