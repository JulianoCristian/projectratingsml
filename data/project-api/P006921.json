The program components supported by the proposed loan are: (i) the construction of a 27 km transmission pipe and tunnel to divert up to 1,8001/sec of water from the Rio Macho power plant reservoir to an expanded Tres Rios Water treatment plant (\"Orosi Scheme\"); (ii) the replacement of water mains in low-income areas of San Jose and installation of 30,000 water meters throughout Costa Rica; (iii) the preparation of a water and sewerage master plant for San Jose and three adjacent cities; and (iv) technical assistance to help develop AyA's capacity to plan and manage a national sector program responsive to rural and urban service needs. The project would alleviate water shortages in the capital city; set the basis for sectoral improvements in the remainder of Costa Rica; and help establish AyA's financial autonomy. The project faces no special risks."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Costa Rica!$!CR","sector1":{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"","Percent":0},"totalcommamt":"26,000,000","sector":[{"Name":"(Historic)Urban water supply"}],"docty":"Project Completion Report,Loan Agreement,Guarantee Agreement,Memorandum & Recommendation of the President,Staff Appraisal Report","countrycode":"CR","sectorcode":"WU","mjsector_namecode":[{"name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","code":"WX"}],"mjthemecode":"8","mjtheme_namecode":[{"name":"","code":"8"}],"sector_namecode":[{"name":"(Historic)Urban water supply","code":"WU"}],"source":"IBRD","majorsector_percent":[{"Name":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","Percent":100}],"projectdocs":[{"DocTypeDesc":"Project Completion Report (PCR),  Vol.1","DocType":"PCR","EntityID":"000009265_3960925054236","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000009265_3960925054236","DocDate":"30-NOV-1990"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.","DocType":"LA","EntityID":"090224b081e975ca_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975ca_1_0","DocDate":"23-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.","DocType":"GA","EntityID":"090224b081e975c9_1_0","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081e975c9_1_0","DocDate":"23-DEC-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President (MOP),  Vol.1","DocType":"MOP","EntityID":"000178830_98101902363446","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101902363446","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"},{"DocTypeDesc":"Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),  Vol.1","DocType":"SAR","EntityID":"000178830_98101912511668","DocURL":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000178830_98101912511668","DocDate":"30-NOV-1980"}],"countryname":"Republic of Costa Rica"}},"facets":{}}
