The objective of the investment is to extend the lifetime and improve the quality, reliability, safety and efficiency of the bulk power transmission system by replacing ageing existing facilities with new ones. The technical assistance will serve to facilitate project implementation, strengthen the transmission system operator, and improve both the tariff structure and the procurement procedures applicable to electricity imports. This restructuring paper proposes: (i) amendments to the legal agreements (Development Credit Agreement and Project Agreement, or DCA and PA) to reflect the unbundling of the power sector and substitution of implementing entity; (ii) an extension of the closing date from January 31, 2011, to June 30, 2012; and (iii) revision of the key performance indicators (annex one)."},"country_namecode":"Republic of Albania!$!AL","sector1":{"Name":"Transmission and Distribution of Electricity","Percent":100},"theme1":{"Name":"Regulation and competition
