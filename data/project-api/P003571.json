The project's main objectives are to assist MOR: 1) redefine the relationship between the railway and the Government; 2) reshape the railway's organization and strengthen its internal management; 3) expand the railway's transport capacity, raise its investment efficiency, and enhance its finances; and 4) modernize the railway's technologies and bolster the efficiency and quality of its transport operations and service. To achieve these objectives, MOR formulated a series of components on policy reform and institutional development (PID), investments, and studies. PID components include: 1) railway enterprise reform; 2) railway tariff reform; and 3) labor productivity enhancement. Investments include: 1) expanding corridor capacity; 2) modernizing information systems; 3) upgrading telecommunications systems; 4) commercializing container transport; 5) enhancing environmental protection; and 6) expanding system capacity. The studies include components that will provide MOR with the technical assistance and software needed to prepare future railway projects or to develop and apply new railway technologies and management techniques."},"country_namecode":"People's Republic of
