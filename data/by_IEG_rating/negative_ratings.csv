Special arrangements would be made to provide for (a) coordination of project execution  including activities and services to be delivered after facilities' completion; (b) channelling of funds; and (c) recovery of investments.
The project would (i) improve sanitary conditions in 23 cities by providing additional water supply and/or sewerage services  as well as improving existing services  and (ii) strengthen the Borrower and the participating water and sewerage regional/municipal companies. Of the project investments about 35% would be for sewerage works  20% for distribution pipes  17% for water production  11% for engineering and administration  and the remaining 17% for pumping stations  storage tanks  meters and operation equipment  and technical assistance. The project would provide water through house connections to about 473 000 people in 19 cities by 1983  and sewerage services to 654 000 people in 14 cities by 1983; about half of this population belongs to poorest population earning less than one third of the per capita national income. The project presents higher than usual risks in that it may not be implemented in the intended period  principally because the borrower and the participating water and sewerage companies may not be able to achieve the forecast institutional and financial improvements within a short period of time. It is to be expected that the Government's commitment to strengthening the institutions in the water and sewerage sector together with close supervision
The Guelbs Iron Ore Project for Mauritania consists of the sequential development of two new iron ore open pits with proven reserves of 386 million tons  both located in proximity to the present mining town of Zouerate and existing intrastructure  to gradually replace the Kedia pits now being depleted.

Additional support activities such as agricultural credit  minimum price purchase mechanisms  and financing for some incremental recurrent costs not financed under the project would be provided by the Government.
The project would be the first example in the Sudan of a systematic  planned approach to the development of land for mechanized farming. Twenty-five year leases  coupled with better water supplies and roads  would encourage investment in adequate machinery and other on-farm improvements. Adequate machinery and improved husbandry methods would create soil conditions which would help to maintain fertility and in the long term make the use of fertilizer economic. The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange costs of the first four-year phase of this program. About 140 farms  averaging 1 000 acres each  would be established  but land planning  construction of roads  water supplies and simple conservation works would cover a somewhat larger area to allow uninterrupted transition to later phases of the program. The Corporation would undertake land clearing  recovering the cost through a 25-year development fee. Rents would cover the ongoing cost of a small advisory service  which would supplement the Ministry of Agriculture's extension service by specializing in mechanization problems. About one-third of the proposed loan would be used to establish a farm credit scheme for the purchase of machinery.
The proposed credit would assist in financing the construction or extension of two institutes for agricultural technician training  two teacher training institutes and selected secondary schools  and the provision of specialist teachers and teacher fellowships.
The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of diesel locomotives  rolling stock  rails and accessories  river and harbor craft  cranes  cargo handling equipment  machinery and construction materials.
The Second Karonga Rural Development Project consists of the provision of seasonal and medium term credit to farmers  extension service  market complexes  health facilities  boreholes and other infrastructural facilities  agricultural and hydrological research  preparatory investments for the National Rural Development program  and rehabilitation of berthing facilities at Chipoka Lake terminal.
The First National Rural Development Program Project will assist the Government to implement the first phase of Malawi's National Rural Development Programme. Over a five-year period  it aims to increase output of four major crops (maize  groundnuts  dark-fired and oriental tobacco and rice) and expand production of milk and meat. It would also complete the consolidation phase of the Lilongwe Land Development Programme. About 90 000 farm families would benefit directly from the project which would enable them to increase their annual farm income by at least 40 percent. Major risks facing the project are: (i) adoption of improved husbandry practices by farmers may be slower than projected; (ii) fertilizer use may be reduced if the prices of fertilizers rise faster than smallholder producer prices; (iii) dark-fired tobacco may prove difficult to market due to limited world demand.
The Shire Valley Agriculture Consolidation Project will intensify the provision of agricultural extension services; establish an irrigated seed multiplication farm and an afforestation program; provide production credit; improve livestock extension services; expand the fisheries development program; improve village health facilities and potable water supply; and extend farm to market road networks. It would provide social and infrastructural services to about 70 000 families and introduce improved farming practices  which would enable about 40 000 smallholder families in the Shire Valley to increase their annual farm income from about US$75 to US$120. The major risks facing the project are a recurrence of extreme drought conditions experienced during the implementation of the second phase  the performance of some recently developed project cropping packages under prevailing farming conditions  the availability of an adequate number of qualified agricultural extension staff and their ability to effectively implement the training and visit system  and the danger of new outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease.
The project seeks over a five-year period to consolidate and expand the assistance to small farmers in the Eastern region which was begun under the previous two Bank Group integrated agricultural projects. By extending coverage to farmers in the entire Eastern Region  it would further increase food and export crop production and raise agricultural incomes. It provides: agricultural inputs  credit  extension services  feeder roads  and village wells in the project area; and technical assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture to support and plan future agricultural development projects throughout the country. About 12 600 farm families  all of whom earn per capita incomes below US$200 per annum  would earn significantly higher incomes under the crop improvement and credit plans. Taking into account the improvement in agricultural services and the road and well components  altogether some 50 000 (or 50 percent) of the rural families in the province would benefit. Normal risks associated with projects of this kind would be reduced by the fact that this is the third phase in the area and would build upon the organizational structure and techniques developed in the previous phases. The main risk would be that difficulties in strengthening the extension would arise.
Over a five year period  the project would increase food production and farm incomes by expanding the assistance to small farmers begun under a Phase I project in the Northern Province. Development of upland and swampland rice  groundnuts  and maize started under the previous project  which covered 4 900 square km  would be extended to reach farmers in an additional 8 500 square km area. Fruit tree cultivation and livestock promotion would be introduced. For these purposes  the project would provide: agricultural inputs  credit  extension services  feeder roads  village wells  and technical assistance. About 13 500 farm families  or about 40 percent of rural families in the area covered by the two projects  would benefit directly and earn significantly higher incomes. All of these families earn below the relative rural poverty threshold for Sierra Leone of $67. Taking into account the general improvement in agricultural services and the road and well components  nearly 50 percent of the rural families in the Phase I and II areas would benefit. Normal risks associated with projects of this kind would be reduced by the fact that this is the second phase in the area and would build upon the organizational structure and techniques developed under the previous phase.

The project would consist of a Pilger mill with a capacity of about 130 000 tpy of large diameter seamless wall pipe. It would produce about 100 different types of large diameter pipes to meet increasing domestic and international demand for these products  and to save and earn foreign exchange. Pipes produced under the project would find a wide range of applications across Romanian industry including oil and gas exploration  production and transportation  chemicals  boiler  machine tool and earth moving equipment manufacture  ship building  and marine platform manufacture. The transfer of the Pilger mill technology will be a benefit to the Romanian pipe industry. About 900 new jobs will be created  and net foreign exchange benefits are estimated at $74 million annually at full production. The market and commercial risks arising from uncertainty of export market and export prices for the project products are not considered major since COMECON countries and China could absorb project output if the expected market opportunities were not fully realized. The technical risk that steel ingots of required quality would temporarily not be produced in Romania would be minimized by training and provision of technical assistance.
The project would consist of the installation of a 30 000 metric tons per year (tpy) acetylene unit using methane feedstock which would provide additional acetylene intermediate to new or expanded downstream units and would also deliver off-gases for use in the existing ammonia reactor and in part of the new acetic acid plant. The capacities of the existing vinyl acetate and polyvinyl acetate units would be expanded and the acetaldehyde unit would be fully utilized. New units which would be constructed under the project include methanol  acetic acid  acetic anhydride  and ethyl acetate plants. A new unit would also be constructed for the separation of carbon monoxide (CO) which would provide CO to the new acetic acid plant and hydrogen to the existing butanol plant. The project would enable Romania both to earn and save scarce foreign exchange  and would assist in the transfer of technology to the Romania chemical sector for some of the project products. The project would also provide employment for about 1 100 people. The only substantial identified risk is that it may not be possible to achieve fully the planned exports of 30 percent of production during the first three years of operation due to heavy competion.
Agricultural credit subprojects to be financed under the proposed loan are expected to include investments to be undertaken in 1980-83 for 37 new broiler breeding farms  modernization of 20 existing broiler production farms  28 new mechanized broiler production farms  15 new poultry slaughterhouses  provision of specialized equipment for quality control  applied research  disease control and performance standards improvement and provision for infusion of current pure line breeding stock with imported pedigreed stock. The project would be the first significant step by the Government designed to contribute to fulfilling unsatisfied domestic demand for fresh meat which has hitherto been suppressed due to the need to earn scarce foreign exchange. Annual incremental poultry meat production resulting from the project would reach 157 000 tons (liveweight) at full development in 1987. The project is also expected to create about 9 000 new jobs. The main risk confronting the project is that the projected efficiency improvement in poultry industry may not be attained unless the feed conversion ratio and the managerial and technical quality of the local staff improve as planned and sufficient specialized quality and health control equipment is provided.
The Fourth Livestock Project will consist of selected investments undertaken between mid 1981 and mid 1984 as part of Romanian Five Year Plan for 1981-1985 for milk and beef production. The project will comprise about 60 percent of the total planned investment over the three year period  and will include: 92 new and 32 modernized dairy farms  17 new specialized breeding heifer production farms  19 new beef fattening units  109 improved pasture units  milk and beef processing and storage facilities  on-farm production of milk  meat and breeding animals by individual producers  and technical services and research. The project will address the unsatisfied domestic demand for milk and beef products and generate additional foreign exchange earnings. Substantial production efficiency improvement is expected through technical innovations and institutional improvements under the project. At full development  incremental project production will reach about 3.8 million hectolitre (hl) of milk  40 thousand tons of carcass beef and 33 thousand breeding heifers. Additionally  a substantial amount of fertilizer will be produced from the incremental farmyard manure.
The main objectives of the Caracal Titu Irrigation Project will be to increase and stabilize crop production and to raise productivity. This will be accomplished through construction of irrigation and drainage systems and related facilities. The project works will include construction and improvement of irrigation facilities and surface drainage systems  soil erosion control  sandy area reclamation  construction of four flood retention dams and valley training. Equipment for operation and maintenance and farm machinery will also be provided under the project. Benefits from crop production in the project areas will increase from a fluctuating annual average of about $342 million to a relatively stable annual average of about $693 million. Yield increases in various crops in the newly irrigated areas will range from about 100 percent for wheat to about 175 percent for maize and alfalfa and the cropping intensity will increase by about 17 percent. The project will more than double labor productivity. The economy at large will be the main beneficiary of the project. However  it will also somewhat increase the income of the 73 700 active members of of CAPs and the 4 300 employees of the IASs in the project area  and is expected to create about 6 200 new jobs.

To that end  the project includes: (a) adaptive research and extension; (b) agricultural input supply; (c) rural access roads; and (d) management  monitoring and evaluation. As a result  the project will increase production of food by smallholders  resulting in increased incomes and nutrition. Reductions in transport costs from improvements in rural access roads will reduce the costs of inputs and consumption goods in the area  and increase producer prices through improved access and competition in the food market.
The Rubber Development Project consists of the new planting and replanting of 40 000 ha of rubber  of which 36 000 ha would be on state farms and 4 000 ha on nearby communes. It would provide for the planting of windbreaks in typhoon-prone areas and intercropping in immature rubber. It would also include modernization of machinery and transport fleets on state farms  construction or upgrading of sawmills and timber utilization facilities  construction of housing  administrative and service buildings and the construction or upgrading of road links within state farms. Technical assistance would be provided for training and for consultant services (26-man-months) in estate management  wood processing  and rubber and windbreak development.
The project will contribute to the intensification of rainfed agriculture  the expansion of agricultural exports  the alleviation of poverty  and improved land use. It will pursue these aims by strengthening the capability of the Agricultural Land Reform Office (ALRO) to implement a series of land reform and development projects on encroached public lands and by demonstrating the viability of a land reform and infrastructure development model in an initial set of nine land reform areas (LRAs) of 192 000 ha affecting some 35 000 low-income families. Furthermore  it will promote appropriate land use by releasing the LRAs from forest reserve status through degazettement and by promoting soil conservation on sloping land. Finally  it will facilitate the absorption of the LRAs into the provincial administrative framework. The major risk associated with implementation of the project concerns the fact that ALRO has not yet had extensive experience in implementing land distribution measures and coordinating the activities of other agencies involved in LRAs. The extensive use of technical assistance and the adoption of a subproject approach are meant to minimize this risk.

The project's objective is to ensure an adequate future supply of fertilizers to meet the increasing needs of the agricultural sector up to the late-1980s. For this purpose  the project would help replace some obsolete plants  revamp others and increase production capacity. It includes construction of an ammonia plant with 900 metric tons capacity per day  and two nitric acid plants  each with 360 metric tons capacity per day; revamping of urea and ammonium nitrate facilities; and a study of fertilizer use in Portugal. The Government is determined to develop agriculture to its full potential and is taking important measures (improved agricultural credit  extension and training) to that end. However  the very low fertilizer use should be improved in order to render the other development measures fully effective. The proposed project would help determine ways and means of promoting efficient fertilizer use by farmers and would ensure that the future fertilizer requirements are met at competitive cost  without dependence on imports and free of international market fluctuations. The productivity gains which are expected to result from better fertilizer availability and use would help to increase total agricultural output  and reduce agricultural imports.
The Mukonchi Training Unit  which has been placed under the TBZ is located in the Central Province  north of Lusaka. The Training Unit consists of ten nucleus estates of 350 acres each. The nucleus estates operate as commercial farms in addition to providing training facilities. At present  Mukonchi trains 25 new farmers each year. Under the proposed project  the training capacity at Mukonchi will be doubled. Farmers will undergo a training period of four years after which they will be settled on farms developed under the second part of the project as described below. The second component of the project would be the development of new farms  which would support annual production of tobacco and maize. Most of the farms would be allotted to graduates of Mukonchi and to other Zambian farmers with adequate experience. In both cases the farmers would be supervised and assisted by the Mukonchi staff and  for purposes of the project  are classified as assisted tenant farmers. Finally  the project would also provide for one specialist in smallholder tobacco growing to enable TBZ to prepare and implement the so-called One-Acre Scheme. Under this Scheme  small farmers who usually cultivate one acre or less  will be trained and supervised in growing tobacco.

The Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation project seeks to restructure the urban water supply sector by contracting out a number of its operations  such as leak detection and repair  otpimization of meter reading and billing  and network recalibration and mapping  with private entrepreneurs. It advocates the creation of self-financing water utilities that would operate under concession agreements with the Government. To promote water conservation  the report recommends charging the true economic cost of the services to consumers. Until now  a national tariff structure has been applied for water services  with no provision for capital consumption and expansion. The project proposes changing this policy by levying regional tariffs that would cover both operating and maintenance costs  and the concession fees. The Government will use these fees to finance asset renewal and expansion. As large volumes of water produced are now unaccounted for  the project includes a network rehabilitation program aiming at reducing water losses. Most wastewater treatment plants in Algeria are currently inoperative. As a result  water pollution is spreading around the large urban agglomerations  damaging the natural environment. To mitigate these damages  the project proposes the rehabilitation of a number of existing wastewater treatment plants.
Rwanda's inflation rate was low and its growth rate sustained from 1970 to the mid 1980s. GDP has declined since then due to low coffee prices and poor weather. The objective of this project is to promote swift growth of the Rwandan private sector. The private sector is considered a key element in a strategy for growth and diversification. The project will promote efforts to ensure that the private sector has access to investment financing and managerial and technical support. It will also support efforts to improve the legal and regulatory environment and enhance the investment and export incentives. The three components of the project which will aid in achieving these goals include: line of credit; private sector support fund; and institutional strengthening. The Rwandan government believes that growth led by the private sector can provide employment and make a significant contribution to export earnings. The project is a complement to Rwanda's macroeconomic adjustment program already in place.

This report appraises a Bank loan of US$46.0 million to help finance: (a) part of the ongoing expansion of the Societe Nationale des Materiaux de Construction (SNMC)  the Algerian state enterprise for construction materials  through erection of a new 500 000 ton per year cement plant near Saida away trom the coast in the rural south; (b) the expansion of the company's distribution network; and (c) a technical assistance program to the Societe Nationale de Comptabilite (SNC)  the state accounting and auditing company. If approved  the loan would be the Bank's first direct industrial operation since lending was resumed in FY1973. The prime purpose of the Bank loan lies not so much in its financial contribution of somewhat more than 20 percent of estimated project costs as in its effort at institution building in Algeria's building material sector. The project attempts to help SNMC cope with present and future organizational and financial problems created by an ambitious investment program which  between 1974 and 1980  is expected to require fixed asset expenditures in excess of US$2.0 billion and which aims at making Algeria independent in cement and some other building materials by the end of this decade. To this end  cement production is expected to increase from about 1.5 million tons in 1975 to about 8.0 million tons by 1980.
The project would include: (i) construction  furnishings  equipment and related technical assistance for a new Technological Institute of Electricity and Electronics; (ii) a study of Algeria's needs through 1980 for high level engineers and technicians  in particular for electrical and electronics specialists; (iii) technical assistance for primary and secondary education reform; (iv) pre-investment studies on the development of vocational training centers and on the development of an establishment required to meet the need for vocational training instructors; and (v) pre-investment studies on automated data processing and on the introduction of modern technology in higher education.
This report appraises an industrial line of credit for the development of small and medium size industry in Algeria  mainly in the construction materials sector. An important aspect of the proposed loan of US$40 million are the arrangements for technical assistance intended to upgrade the project appraisal and supervision capabilities of Banque Algerienne de Developpement (BAD)  the borrower and administrator of the loan. Although this first loan to BAD will be confined essentially to the financing of construction materials industries  the Algerian authorities expect that  over time  the experience acquired by BAD's unit in appraising and supervising a number of medium-sized projects will set a pattern for BAD in most of its future operations  whatever their nature and sources of funding. Progress should gradually enable BAD to assume a stronger role in the Algerian investment-decision process. Whether this approach will work  particularly whether BAD's new working tools will carry weight is the essential risk in this operation which has considerable attributes of an experiment in the Algerian context.
The main objectives of the Second Rural Electrification Project are to: (a) expand electricity supply to the rural areas; (b) improve the reliability and quality of service of the existing rural distribution network; (c) strengthen the administrative  planning and financial capabilities in the power subsector; (d) implement institutional reforms; and (e) encourage further reforms in the electricity tariff structure. The project will provide electricity to about 170 000 new customers in 462 villages. It includes: (a) construction of distribution lines and transformers capacity; (b) construction of operating buildings and supply of vehicles and specialized equipment; (c) consultants' services to assist in detailed engineering design. The project also will strengthen Office National de l'Electricite (ONE's) distribution department through technical assistance  training and logistical support to plan  monitor and implement the rural electrification program. The project provides funds for civil works  equipment installation and erection  training and technical assistance.
The proposed credit would help finance the development of irrigation through low lift pumps on 6 500 acres of land in the dry zone. 6 100 acres are located on existing colonization schemes at four different locations. At present most farmers on these schemes are able to cultivate only those parts of their holdings which lie below the level of the irrigation canals. These low lying areas are used exclusively for paddy. The installation of the low lift pumps will enable water to be pumped from the canals to irrigate the land around the homestead sites which are between 15 and 50 feet above the canals. With irrigation  this land is very suitable for growing chillies and onions. At present prices the return per acre will be considerably higher than from paddy and will permit a substantial increase in net farm incomes. The project also includes 400 acres of youth settlement schemes under a plan for settling unemployed educated youth in the 17-21 year age group on 2-acre lift irrigated plots.
The Rasuwa - Nuwakot Rural Development Project is the second phase of the IDA-financed Rural Development Project  covering the Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts in the Central Development Region of Nepal  which was completed in June 1984. The Rasuwa - Nuwakot Rural Development Project will aim: (a) to consolidate the investments made during the earlier phase of development by making all physical facilities fully operational  and by improving the qualities and coverage of agricultural support services and the services of the institutions responsible for rural infrastructure development and maintenance. It would also seek (b) to further improve the agricultural production base and the socio-economic infrastructure; (c) to expand forestry plantation and soil conservation programs; and (d) to promote development of effective local level planning and implementation of rural development projects.
The proposed project provides for the construction of a new well center and about six miles of distribution mains to improve the existing water supply and to provide water for certain newly developed areas; construction of about five miles of sewers with three sewage collection centers; and of about three miles of unpaved drainage channels and two main drainage pumping stations. These works are expected to be completed in about two years and would constitute the first stage of a long-range program. Funds would be provided under the credit for employment of management consultants to assist LIT in the establishment of an efficient organization  and for the employment of engineering consultants to supervise the execution of the work included in the project and to design a six-year program of rehabilitation and extension of services.
The project seeks to increase water use efficiency and raise agricultural production and farm income in Wadi Tuban through the use of modern inputs and improved cultural practices. It provides for credit to cooperative and state farms  construction of feeder roads  a village water supply scheme and improved irrigation system; a water management study; an agricultural policies study; and technical assistance and training. The principal beneficiaries would be 7 000 cooperative farm families (36 000 persons) whose present income is well below the poverty level; the project would help to increase their income by about 63 percent in six years. The project faces no special risks although delays in recruiting the expatriate experts to assist in implementing the project would result in a postponement of the benefits to a period later than envisaged. Institution building objectives would be achieved through technical assistance comprising management support to the implementing agency and training of its staff.
The Integrated Nutrition Project will initiate development of a national nutrition program whose long-term goal is to improve nutritional status so that malnutrition would eventually cease to be a public health problem. The project will have three components.. The National level nutrition activities component includes four sub-components: 1) program development and institution building  to develop national capacity in nutrition and to promote needed policy research and operation research; 2) information  education and communication (IEC) development to assess current behavioral aspects relevant to nutrition an develop appropriate messages and materials for use in IEC activities through inter-personal methods at the community level and through the mass media at the national level; 3) strengthening of existing nutition activities; and 4) project management  monitoring and evaluation. The community-based nutrition component focuses on growth monitoring and promotion activities with targeted and supervised supplementary feeding at the village level in community nutrition centers  which will serve as a locus for inter-personal IEC and mobilization of community actions to promote nutrition. The inter-sectoral nutrition program development will improve nutrition by emphasizing nutritional aspects of activities in various sectors and by supporting innovative actions with potential nutrition impact.
The Agricultural Services Project constitutes the first tranche of a long term national program aimed at strengthening agricultural support services. Specific objectives are to: 1) increase farmers' and pastoralists incomes; 2) improve the lot of rural women; 3) improve the links between extension and research; and 4) strengthen producer organizations. The primary component of the project is the improvement of livestock and crop extension services. There are also two secondary components  which are the following: 1) strengthening of producer organizations through functional literacy training; and 2) strengthening the analytical capacity of the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR) through training and short term consultancies.
The project will finance expertise  training and equipment for key institutions responsible for macro-economic management and civil service. Specific components include establishing a national planning system through the strengthening of the structures of the National Planning Ministry. Also the efficiency of the tax and customs operations will be improved; and financial management strengthened through the enhancement of the analytical capacity of the Economic and Finance Ministry. Furthermore the project will establish within the Statistics Department a permanent capacity for carrying out standard of living surveys and in depth socio economic studies to identify adverse impacts of adjustment measures. Finally the civil service will be modernized through improving the structures  staff levels and data processing methods of the Civil Service Department and the Central Payroll Agency  and reviewing the existing civil service rules and regulations.
The Fisheries Project will increase the incomes of fishermen by increasing marketed fish production; post-harvest losses would be reduced and fish quality improved by providing storage and preservation facilities. Improved fishing craft and gear would enable fishermen to increase fish catches and production. The proposed pilot Fish Farming Development Center would also contribute to increasing marketed fish production. If successful  the Center would be the nucleus of a second phase expansion for the development of outgrower fish ponds. The project would also include funds for research  training  and studies. The majority of the prospective Project beneficiaries currently earn the equivalent of about US$80 per capita per year. At full development  beneficiaries' annual per capita incomes could be expected to have increased by about 50%. The principal risk the Project would face is that the ice plants and refrigerated stores would not be managed efficiently.

Studies carried out by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission for the area in which the vessels would operate  in the Pacific off the Ecuadorian Coast  indicate that the abundance of tuna is more than sufficient to warrant the expanded exploitation which is envisaged. When all vessels are in full operation  an increase of over US$3 million in annual foreign exchange earnings is expected. This increase represents almost 45 percent of the foreign exchange earnings for the entire Ecuadorian fishing industry in 1967.

The Second Cotton Rehabilitation Project is part of a long-term cotton rehabilitation program. It aims at increasing annual cotton production by about 30 000 tons in the areas of three major cotton companies  which account for over 80 percent of Zaire's cotton production. It will help reduce imports of cotton lint and textiles. An additional objective will be to expand production of food crops grown in rotation with cotton.
The project would be implemented in two phases: a four month establishment phase to set up the implementation agency and a twenty month phase which would include the following main components: (i) establishment of a training and extension system for the Project area; (ii) development of a cattle-breeding ranch; (iii) establishment of supporting services and infrastructures for marketing and agricultural credit; (iv) applied research and studies; and (v) technical assistance for the Ministry of Planning. The principal benefit of the Project would be institution building. Because of the experimental nature of the Project  no significant increase in agricultural production can be expected in the short run. However  if successful  the Project could lead to broad-based  comprehensive projects for agricultural and livestock development in Kwango-Kwilu. The institutional arrangements could be ultimately replicated in other agricultural development projects in Zaire.
The Kwilu-Ngongo Sugar Project for Zaire will include: (i) rehabilitation and extension of an existing sugar plantation  including provision of equipment for land preparation  cultivation and harvesting; (ii) rehabilitation of transport infrastructure  and provision of equipment for sugar cane transport and track maintenance; (iii) civil works for the rehabilitation and expansion of processing facilities and construction of offices and staff housing; (iv) design and implementation of an applied research program on sugarcane; (v) purchase and installation of a data processing and management information system; (vi) staff training; and (vii) pilot projects to promote food-crop production. The project faces few technical  commercial or managerial risks. There are some risks of delays in project implementation due to the general economic conditions in Zaire. The main risks will be a deterioration of the Company's financial situation if the government failed to increase sugar prices to reflect production costs  or to provide foreign exchange to purchase agricultural inputs  spare parts and supplies. To reduce these risks  the Government has agreed that sugar prices will be reviewed whenever required and has established a mechanism to allocate foreign exchange to Compagnie Sucriere.

The project will support the adoption of high density planting technology in Romania. The project will also support the Government's efforts designed to meet unsatisfied domestic demand for fresh fruit which has been hitherto suppressed due to shortage of local fruit with the Government keeping fruit imports to a minimum to conserve scarce foreign exchange. Incremental production resulting from the project will reach 528 000 tons annually. Per capita consumption of the types of fruit financed by the project will increase to 71 kgby 1988 from the present level of 36 kg. The project is also expected to create about 19 500 jobs in new orchards. There is a small risk that fruit yields or quality will be somewhat below expectations due to weather  lack of inputs or problems in orchard management. However  this will not depress the economic return on the project.

The Government of Argentina has undertaken a major reform of economic policy aimed at price stability and sustained economic growth. Measures to focus the state on core public functions and raise the efficiency of revenue mobilization have been essential for improving the fiscal fundamentals. Trade liberalization and the deregulation of domestic markets have improved economic efficiency. These reforms have been strongly encouraged and supported by the World Bank. Complementing earlier public sector reforms  the Bank extended two Public Enterprise Reform Adjustment Loans and a Public Sector Reform Loan (1991-92) along with complementary technical assistance loan (1991). The Government is now in the process of reducing the role of public banks and strengthening private banks. To support these reforms the Bank approved the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) in February 1993. This report proposes a Capital Market Development Technical Assistance (CMTAP) Project that will help provide term finance from private sources. The Capital Market Development Project will support a backstop facility (BF) that will offer prime-rated banks an option to sell to the BF medium-term US dollar-dominated bonds which will be issued for the purpose of rolling over prior dollar-denominated bonds that those banks had issued to support their longer term loan for productive purposes. A policy and institutional development program agreed between the Government and the bank will help increase market confidence. A complementary technical assistance loan will finance improvements in the capital market supervision and regulation  including enforcement; training of commercial banks to undertake project financing; and implementation of the new  recently approved pension system. These will help improve the policy framework for the project. This report discusses how the project will facilitate the implementation of the capital market development project in an efficient manner by supporting the creation of new institutions and the strengthening of others  by ensuring the development of more effective capital market regulations. In particular  the TA loan will support the institutional strengthening of the securities market regulatory Comision Nacional de Valores (CNV) -- and the reinforcement of security market regulations; b) the implementation of the pension reform legislation that reforms the social security system which promotes the development of independent pension funds and creates a new supervisory agency; and c) early establishment by private training institutions of an advanced progr improve local skills in the area of term financing for investment projects. The project will finance expenditures -- mainly for hiring consultants -- to assist the Government in the following activities: a) developing of the securities markets; b) implementation of the pension and the new pension funds system; c)) training program for long-term financial intermediation; and d) institutional framework for project implementation.
