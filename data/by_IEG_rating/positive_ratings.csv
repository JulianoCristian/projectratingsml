The project would help finance a cashew production program in the States of Kerala  Karnataka  Andhra Pradesh and Orissa  together with necessary supporting facilities. Cashew plantations would include new planting on 53 775 ha and improvements of existing plantation on 7 500 ha. About 30 500 ha of new planting and 4 500 ha of improvements would be carried out by smallholder farmers  and 23 275 ha of new planting and 3 000 ha of improvements by State Corporations. The project would also strengthen cashew development units in each State  strengthen State Corporations  and implement a program of research and training and a cashew industry study. Project risks include the possible lack of coordination among the numerous agencies involved in implementation  and a possible lack of adequate response from the farmers for the proposed long-gestation investments. Measures have been included to coordinate  monitor and expedite all phases of implementation  and necessary services and incentives would be provided to farmers. The risks are  therefore  no greater than normally found in this kind of project.
The project would increase supplies of fuelwood in rural areas of each of the State's nineteen districts. It would also provide poles  bamboo  small timber and other minor products from the same plantations. Achievement of these objectives would be facilitated by the gradual shifting of responsibility for the establishment  maintenance  protection and harvesting of village woodlots from the Government of Gujarat (GOG) to village panchayats. The project would also introduce improved stoves and crematoria as fuelwood conservation measures  provide considerable paid employment to the poorest section of the population and help to stabilize the environment. The principal project risks are: (i) that the free distribution of seedlings might lead to excessive waste  (ii) that villages would be reluctant to assume responsibility for their woodlots  and (iii) that the better-off villagers would preempt most of the benefits of village woodlot production.
The Kerala Agricultural Extension Project seeks to achieve early and sustained increases in agricultural production throughout Kerala's eleven districts through the reorganization and strengthening of the extension service of DOA.

The National Agricultural Research Project is intended to address the agricultural problems specific to individual agro-ecological regions of the country and to narrow the gap between research programs and the needs of farmers for new technology and information. The project will strengthen and reorient research at SAU and strengthen ICAR's ability to support  guide  coordinate and monitor agricultural research at the state level. The project will focus on research on higher yielding  more disease and pest resistant varieties of grain and oilseed crops  and on improved cropping patterns and agronomic practices  particularly for rainfed areas. Research results will benefit both large and small farmers living in the different ecological regions within participating states.
The project is designed to assist the Philippine Government in realizing its objective of expanding and diversifying the institutional capacity of financial intermediaries capable of mobilizing and allocating medium- and long-term resources to development projects in the industrial sector. In particular  it would develop the capacity of PISO  a private financial institution  to initiate and expand its medium- and long-term lending operations. The proposed loan will be used by PISO for making sub-loans to finance foreign exchange requirements of projects mainly in manufacturing. In addition to the institutional improvements for which this project provides  there are a number of financial and industrial sector issues which the Government would need to address within the next few years. The effectiveness of PISO in mobilizing and allocating financial (particularly local) resources will  to an important degree  depend on the policy adjustments which the Government makes in the coming years. Apart from these broader sectoral concerns  there are no special risks associated with the project.
The project would support NEA's rural electrification program during 1979-80  thereby assisting the Government in meeting its target of bringing electric service to the entire population by 1990. One of the program's main objectives is to improve the standard of living of people in provincial towns and rural areas. The project would provide access to electricity services for some 877 000 families (or 5.3 million individuals) in these areas  help create new job opportunities  and thereby incomes among the rural population. The primary risk relates to the fact that the rural electric cooperatives which are now in operation are still within the five-year grace period of their initial loans from NEA and have therefore not yet established a repayment record. There is likely to be considerable variation in the financial performance of individual cooperatives due to differences in the degree of economic development in the area  the sizes of the cooperatives  and the varying costs of power in different regions of the country. NEA has been successful in ensuring that the cooperatives follow efficient operating procedures  and has the ability to monitor closely the performance of each cooperative.

"Pakistan's population growth of about 3 percent annually - faster than any other large Asian country - undermines its efforts to relieve poverty and achieve sustainable development. High fertility is part of a web of poor social indicators in Pakistan  tied to slow progress in the social sectors as well as poverty. The best way to slow population growth will be to build demand for smaller families through improvements in education and economic opportunity  especially for women  and in children's survival prospects  while supplying better family planning information and services so that couples can more easily limit fertility. Family planning will then become a more appealing option. Pakistan's Social Action Program  which covers primary education  primary health care  population  and rural water supply  will address both ""demand"" and ""supply"" aspects of family planning. The Population Welfare Program Project will contribute mainly by strengthening supply of family planning information and services  to meet the demand that already exists. It will thus complement other Social Action (SAP) programs and projects in education and health as well as broader efforts to promote economic opportunity that will generate further demand."

It would provide technical assistance for highway maintenance and for strengthening the country's transport planning and coordination capacity. Finally  it would include some pre-investment studies. The major beneficiaries of vehicle operating cost reductions would be the local truck owners and operators  but cost reductions are expected to be passed on to farmers in the form of higher farmgate prices. About 300 000 people live in the area influenced by the main road and more than one million in the areas served by the other project roads.
The objectives of the Fourth Highway Project are to continue efforts started under earlier Bank Group operations to strengthen the Directorate of Roads and Bridges (DRP)  particularly by improving its capacity to carry out effective routine and periodic road maintenance. Specifically  the project is designed to: (i) continue the program for rehabilitation of paved and gravel roads; (ii) improve the organization and administrative procedures of DRP; (iii) train field  workshop  and office staff at different levels to carry out road maintenance tasks; and (iv) institute axle-load control and road safety programs. A major benefit of the project will be its institution-building impact. The most tangible benefit  however  will be derived from the road rehabilitation program in the form of vehicle operating cost savings which will be passed on to users. There are about 400 000 inhabitants in the direct areas of influence of the roads. There is no major risk associated with the project  as it is mainly a continuation of efforts under the Third Highway Project which is progressing satisfactorily.

Associated gas production from the El-Borma oil field is declining rapidly as this field nears depletion. As a result  the Gabes region  the main industrial center in southern Tunisia  will face a significant energy supply deficit by 1993  since it depends on this associated gas for fuel supply. Bank analyses have confirmed that it would be more economic to continue to supply Gabes and its region with natural gas rather than convert existing industries to fuel oil and transfer some of STEG's (Tunisian Company for Electricity and Gas) power generation facilities in Gabes further north on the TMP (Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline). The project will provide a least-cost energy supply alternative for Gabes and other gas markets along the pipeline route. A gas infrastructure network in the southern part of the country to facilitate domestic gas field development will be established. The increased use of natural gas in the industrial and premium fuels markets will be promoted. In addition  the project will develop a sound gas subsector strategy while rationalizing and strengthening the subsector's institutional model. A modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system will be developed to enhance the security of the gas supply.
