There are three\n            subprojects that are considered to have potential adverse\n            environmental impacts: they involve the road network\n            development component and the public transit improvement\n            component. Mitigation measures planned are the following:\n            Contain dust by separating demolition and excavation sites\n            with tarpaulin or similar materials, watering unpaved roads,\n            covering transport vehicles, regularly clearing out garbage,\n            distancing temporary roads from residential areas, and\n            properly operating maintaining, and repairing equipment and\n            machinery. Reduce noise by restricting machinery use at\n            night and restricting heavy vehicles by day, using sound\n            absorption materials, prefabricating some structural\n            components, routinely monitoring motor vehicle noise, and\n            using vegetation buffers and zoning. Protect water quality\n            by proper sewage disposal, and building temporary toilets\n            and sewage collection facilities. Solid waste from\n            construction will be removed from the site. Overpasses and\n            underground passages will be built to ease pedestrian\n            crossing through construction roads. Vehicles transporting\n            hazardous materials must drive on specially designated\n            roads. Lastly, people whose residences are converted for\n            commercial use will receive preferential treatment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental management plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Urumqi Urban Transport\n            Improvement Project - environmental assessment (Vol. 4) :\n            Environmental management plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/04/8342158/urumqi-urban-transport-improvement-project-environmental-assessment-vol-4-environmental-management-plan","projn":"CN-Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement\n            Project -- P045915","subtopic":"Rural Roads & Transport,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Rural Transport","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Transport,Rural Development","count":"China","authors":{"authr":"Xinjiang Environmental Techniques and\n            Assessment Center"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020439_20070920163451"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Sub-national government administration,General transportation sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport,Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Spraying;

The\n            project has five components. 1) Road Network Development\n            will provide a 31.25 km \"Ring Road\" which will\n            link the old central business district (CBD) to new\n            development areas of the city, protect the CBD from\n            extraneous traffic, and distribute regional traffic to the\n            urban trunk road network. 2) Traffic Management and Road\n            Safety will enhance the efficiency in the use of the\n            existing road space and improve traffic safety. 3) Public\n            Transport will develop public transport as a viable and\n            sustainable travel alternative to the car by improving the\n            level of existing bus services. It will support the ongoing\n            reforms towards the strengthening of the regulatory and\n            planning capabilities of the Urban Construction Commission\n            and support commercial viability of Urumqi Public Transport\n            Company. 4) Environmental Management will support\n            Urumqi's leadership which is very active in promoting\n            and implementing environmental protection and improvement\n            initiatives, and further develop a Motor Vehicle Emission\n            Control Strategy. 5) Institutional Development will\n
