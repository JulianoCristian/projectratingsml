The projects were aimed at: (i) expanding the source\n            of wood products through industrial plantation and rural\n            afforestation; (ii) enhancing the value of protected natural\n            forest ecosystems; (iii) developing a high productivity\n            cattle industry from degraded natural forests in the\n            Gishwati area; and (iv) strengthening the institutional\n            capacity of the forest and livestock agencies involved. The\n            main consequence of implementation problems, policy flaws\n            andpoor management capacity was that agroforestry and\n            plantation management objectiveswere not achieved and the\n            institutional strengthening of forestry and livestock\n            institutionsinvolved in the project fell substantially short\n            of the envisaged goals. Sustainable management of forest\n            resources in Rwanda (including fuelwood, buffer zone and\n            industrial plantation resources) will depend in large\n            measure on the willingness of Rwanda's forest service\n            to formulate a new integrated forest policy,correct\n            structural constraints and policy distortions and obtain the\n            administrative meansand legislative tools to implement\n            it.The need for a cross-sectoral approach which addresses\n            constraints and policy distortions underlying the natural\n            resource degradation and forest depletion. Because\n            Government's role in forestry development and\n            environmental conservationwill remain essential, greater\n            attention needs to be paid to capacity building,\n            particularly human resources development, and the long-termn\n            horizon which this implies. Full recognition needs also to\n            be given to the opportunities for rural population and\n            private sector participation in forestry, conservation and\n            forest industry activities. Full advantage should be taken\n            of opportunities to make forestry (and conservation)\n            activities self-sustainable on a financial basis, in order\n            to avoid potential difficulties with counterpart funding.\n            Improved Government/donor coordination in policy dialogue,\n            project design and implementation is essential to maximizing\n            potential development impacts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Second Integrated Forestry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Second Integrated\n            Forestry
