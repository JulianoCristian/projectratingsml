- Fourth Structural Adjustment\n            Credit (SAC IV) Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The ratings for the Fourth Structural\n            Adjustment Credit for Armenia were as follows: the outcome\n            was satisfactory, the sustainability was highly likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The\n            lessons learned indicate that it is very helpful to social\n            sector proponents when the Bank negotiates for higher budget\n            allocations to social sectors. In interviews with nationals,\n            they report that the structural adjustment operations are\n            influential in gaining higher allocations and preventing\n            under-funding of social sectors. Structural Adjustment\n            Credit (SAC5) has incorporated this lesson in its design by\n            obtaining agreement to increase the health and education\n            budgets by 27.0 and 14.4 percent from 2002 to 2003,\n            respectively. Strong TA resources are essential for\n            successful reform program implementation, particularly\n            during the second, more detailed phase of reforms. It has\n            been a matter of practice for Bank TA credits to support\n            Armenian adjustment operations. Without the accompanying\n            Structural Adjustment Technical Assistance Credit (SATAC2),\n            the design and implementation of SAC4 would have been much\n            less geared to national priorities and fewer of the high\n            impact measures would have been identified. In fact, the\n            SATAC2 was restructured specifically to support the new\n            program focus on improved business climate supported by\n            SAC4. Bilateral TA was also important in a number of areas\n            including privatization of the Energy Distribution Company\n            (EDC), legal drafting, and preparation of pension reform. At\n            times it is very difficult to find investors to buy\n            utilities, such as at the time of the SAC4, and putting them\n            up for sale can be risky. Under these circumstances, the\n            Bank should explore new ways of combining the financing and\n            expertise required to privatize. As long as the ultimate\n            objective to transfer ownership of the utility and improve\n            efficiency is achieved, it should not matter that the\n            privatization was not carried out in a conventional way\n            under ideal conditions with a well-funded, high expertise\n            strategic investor."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Fourth Structural Adjustment\n
