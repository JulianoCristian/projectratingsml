The risks involved are\n            no greater than can normally be expected with operations of\n            this type."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Third Rural Electrification Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Third Rural\n            Electrification Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1982/05/725902/india-third-rural-electrification-project","projn":"IN-Rural Elec III -- P009792","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Engineering,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912560635"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural output,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,bank lending,central\n            planning,coal,commercial banks,construction,construction\n            equipment,Consumers,cost minimization,cost\n            savings,covers,Debt,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,Economic Rate of\n            Return,Electricity,electricity consumption,Electricity\n            demand,electricity generation,employment,energy\n            consumption,energy demand,Energy\n            Resources,engineers,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,fire,GDP,geothermal\n            energy,grids,groundwater,groundwater pumping,growth\n            rate,human power,Income,irrigation,Marginal Cost,marginal\n            cost pricing,Mbi,motors,natural gas,nuclear\n            fuels,oil,optimization,organizational\n            structure,petroleum,Power,power development,power\n            generation,power industry,power projects,POWER SECTOR,power\n            station,power stations,power systems,Power\n            Transmission,Present Value,pumping,Pumps,Rural\n            Electrification,structures,surcharges,Technical\n            Assistance,Thermal Power,thermal power plants,value added,voltage,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural output,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,bank lending,central\n            planning,coal,commercial banks,construction,construction\n            equipment,Consumers,cost minimization,cost\n            savings,covers,Debt,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,Economic Rate of\n            Return,Electricity,electricity consumption,Electricity\n            demand,electricity generation,employment,energy\n            consumption,energy demand,Energy\n            Resources,engineers,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,fire,GDP,geothermal\n            energy,grids,groundwater,groundwater pumping,growth\n            rate,human power,Income,irrigation,Marginal Cost,marginal\n            cost pricing,Mbi,motors,natural gas,nuclear\n            fuels,oil,optimization,organizational\n            structure,petroleum,Power,power development,power\n            generation,power industry,power projects,POWER SECTOR,power\n            station,power stations,power systems,Power\n            Transmission,Present Value,pumping,Pumps,Rural\n            Electrification,structures,surcharges,Technical\n            Assistance,Thermal Power,thermal power plants,value added,voltage,wells"}},"owner":"South Asia Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"3612"},"facets":{}}}
