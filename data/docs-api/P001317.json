Another\n            important and related objective was to establish a\n            programmatic investment mechanism and to strengthen\n            institutional procedures and the capacity to generate ideas\n            which could be developed into concrete sub projects. The\n            main lesson learnt from this project is that packaging of\n            many diverse activities into a single project is not\n            advisable. Not only does the project lack focus, it also\n            becomes very difficult to manage, supervise and coordinate.\n            Secondly, a project should as far as possible rely less on\n            Government funding because the level of such funding can be\n            unpredictable as Government's priorities change over\n            time. Thirdly, the key officers charged with implementing a\n            project (in this case the sub-project coordinators) should\n            be thoroughly given advance training in the policies and\n            procedures of the donor agency particularly in procurement\n            and disbursements. Finally staff turnover of key project\n            staff should be kept to a minimum so as to ensure continuity\n            in project management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Rural Services Design Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya -
