Important lessons include: 1) Understand\n            markets and institutions before designing the intervention.\n            The nature o f market failures (if any) should guide the\n            decision whether to intervene at all, and if so, whether to\n            intervene on the supply side or the demand side o f the\n            market. Implementation can be problematic because o f\n            institutional and governance issues. Market and\n            institutional assessments should be done prior to project\n            design to identify these issues. 2) Choose the least-cost\n            intervention. It is important not to over-subsidize\n            services, both to avoid distorting markets and to limit the\n            incentive for corruption. Vouchers may be a relatively\n            high-cost way o f stimulating demand for business\n            development services compared to alternative methods. And\n            subsidies should not become the centerpiece of the project.\n            3) Favor private sector management. Current best practice in\n            projects that use matching grants or vouchers to stimulate\n            markets for business development services is to contract a\n            private firm to manage the program. Clear incentives and\n            performance indicators should be established. 4) Allow time\n            to learn from the pilot phase, providing sufficient\n            opportunity to get management and governance issues right."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Micro and Small Enterprise Training\n            and Technology Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Micro and Small\n            Enterprise Training and Technology Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6049048/kenya-micro-small-enterprise-training-technology-project","projn":"KE-Micro & Small Enterp -- P001353","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050707130011"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Vocational training,General industry and trade sector","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to credit, achievement, Achievements,\n            appropriate technology, business associations, Business\n            Development, Business Development Services, Country\n            Assistance Strategies, districts, expenditures, income,\n            informal sector, innovation, intensive growth, intervention,\n            interventions, labor force, learning, lending operations,\n            market failures, microfinance, natural resources, Papers,\n            peer review, Poverty Reduction, private sector, programs,\n            rural areas, staff development, supermarkets, teacher,\n            technical assistance, Technical Training, Technology\n            Transfer, tenure, Trainees, training institutes, Training\n            Providers, urban areas, urban land, vocational training, vouchers"}},"owner":"AFT: Private Sector (AFTPS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF025159-PHRD-STUDENT FINANCING PROJECT","repnb":"32657"},"2416105":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/06/2416105/kenya-micro-small-enterprise-training-technology-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/06/2416105/kenya-micro-small-enterprise-training-technology-project","new_url":"2003/06/2416105/kenya-micro-small-enterprise-training-technology-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/07/08/000012009_20030708133746/Rendered/INDEX/262300KE0ICR.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/07/08/000012009_20030708133746/Rendered/PDF/262300KE0ICR.pdf","credit_no":"2596","datestored":"2003-07-08T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2003-06-24T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Micro and Small Enterprise Training\n            and Technology Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The assessment of outcome is\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, with high institutional\n            development impacts, although while the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, the Borrower performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory, due to the shifting oversight among four\n            Ministries, delays in effectiveness and implementation, high\n            level of interference, inability to meet the conditions of\n            effectiveness, and attempted fraud. Lessons thus convey the\n            following. A study is needed to determine the rationale for\n            a voucher program/training subsidy, to make a preliminary\n            assessment of the source of market failure, supply side or\n            demand side, and the extent and cause of market failure,\n            i.e., information inadequacy, risk and uncertainty within\n            the market, to assess the likelihood of long-term gains from\n            a temporary injection of resources, as well consider\n            optional approaches including funding or non-funding\n            methods. It is also important to keep down overheads and\n            transaction costs for a given level of oversight, at the\n            same time as finding a structure that most closely resembles\n            the market. Consequently, intermediary layers may be used to\n            provide information, promote the project, vet applicants and\n            issue vouchers, though by and large, intermediaries are not\n            necessarily a feature of a market. Options for setting up\n            intermediaries are to subcontract them to a separate\n            organization, or to set up an allocation infrastructure\n            under the managing entity. Private sector management should\n            be viewed within the scale of the project management\n            responsibility, appropriate to the absorptive capacity of\n            the local private sector, and should be subject to\n            government/donor financial accounting procedures, have an\n            internal procurement system compatible with government/donor\n            procedures, and be expected to speed up procurement of goods\n            and services. Other lessons include the need for oversight\n            and verification processes, moving towards a decentralized,\n            self-policing system; conducting pilot projects to assert\n            adverse implications for market development; a targeted\n            public awareness and information dissemination campaign;\n            and, the phase out of a voucher program, rather than a\n            jumpstart followed by abrupt closure, would be likely to\n            reap superior development impacts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -

to\n            enhance entrepreneurial development in the private sector\n            and, more specifically, reduce constraints to employment\n            promotion and income enhancement in the micro- and small\n            enterprise (informal) sector in Kenya. The project will\n            accomplish this objective through a set of policies for\n            enabling the entrepreneurial environment and developing a\n            national training strategy to improve the quality, access,\n            and sustainable financing of relevant skill upgrading and\n            technology for the informal sector, and a related investment\n            program. The investment program includes: (a) a micro- and\n            small enterprise training fund; (b) a technology\n            information, innovation and research program and pilot\n            infrastructure development; and (c) institutional\n            development. The project will make provisions for increasing\n            women's representation in manufacturing through skills\n            training and technology development suitable for upgrading\n            their enterprises or bringing them into the sector. The\n            Ministry of Research, Technical Training and Technology will\n            use private sector contractors, training and research\n            institutions, the Jua Kali Federation and
