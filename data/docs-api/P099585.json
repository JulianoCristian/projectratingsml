Some lessons\n            learned included: projects that encourage and facilitate\n            close, continuous and direct interaction with the Borrower\n            have a better chance to succeed. In the case of this\n            project, direct lending to a sub-national government, which\n            obviated one layer of bureaucracy, coupled with a Bank field\n            based supervision team providing continuous support to the\n            implementing agencies was a key to the prompt execution of a\n            project with a rather complex civil work component. The\n            focus placed on a multisectoral approach for road safety\n            rooted in the safe system approaches which lead the project\n            to interact with the Ministry of Government on issues\n            related to enforcement (strengthening the Highway Patrol,\n            fine processing procedures, etc.), safe drivers (licensing\n            system, education and awareness campaigns, etc.), and\n            linking it to the lead agency at the national level,\n            contributed to the good outcomes that the province of\n            Cordoba has had in recent years. In this sense, this project\n            showed the merits of improving road safety management based\n            on performance and results, not just road safety\n            interventions linked to infrastructure, but rather working\n            with other sectors and strengthening road safety management\n            more broadly for enhanced impact. Maximizing the benefits of\n            public participation and beneficiaries' opinions while\n            containing the potential costs of a small group of people\n            hindering the implementation of valuable projects requires a\n            well thought management of public information. This includes\n            the timely release of high quality studies of different\n            alternatives prepared by qualified and trusted professionals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -

Road\n            Infrastructure Project aims to improve the reliability of\n            the Province's road sector assets and the efficiency of\n            their management as a means to support the Province's\n            competitiveness and economic growth, by building up\n            institutional capacity to encourage efficient planning\n            policies and adequate resource allocation for the\n            rehabilitation and maintenance of the core provincial road\n            network. The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from October 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013.  The extension is\n            necessary to: (i) further the major governance agenda by\n            completing the procurement and installation of priority\n            information technology equipment and systems related to the\n            Province's efforts for increased transparency,\n            accountability, and citizen responsiveness; (ii) further the\n            road safety agenda that has been of high impact, and a model\n            for other provinces by the procurement of priority road\n            safety equipment; and (iii) enable the timely conclusion of\n            the CREMA (Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Contract -\n            Contrato de Rehabilitacion y Mantenimiento) contract (which\n            ends May 2013). The Borrower has a plan to satisfactorily\n            complete the project in the extended time. This will be the\n            first extension of the project (8 months extension total)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Provincial Road\n            Infrastructure Project : restructuring  : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/06/16706502/argentina-provincial-road-infrastructure-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"AR-Cordoba Road Infrastructure -- P099585","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Post Conflict Reconstruction,Housing & Human Habitats,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Conflict and Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Argentina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20120906005428"},"theme":"Infrastructure services for private sector development,Municipal governance and institution building,Municipal finance,Injuries and non-communicable diseases","subsc":"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Conflict and Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, asset management, Bank\n            policies, beneficiary, Borrower, disbursements, equipment,\n            financial management, information technology, initiative,\n            LOAN, meeting, procurement, Rehabilitation, Road, road\n            safety, transparency"}},"owner":"Transport (LCSTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Urban development,Financial and private sector development","repnb":"72299"},"16706503":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/06/16706503/argentina-provincial-road-infrastructure-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/06/16706503/argentina-provincial-road-infrastructure-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","new_url":"2012/06/16706503/argentina-provincial-road-infrastructure-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","disclosure_date":"2012-09-05T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-09-05T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-09-05T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/09/06/000333038_20120906005658/Rendered/INDEX/722990PJPR0v200ucturing0Data0sheet.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/09/06/000333038_20120906005658/Rendered/PDF/722990PJPR0v200ucturing0Data0sheet.pdf","loan_no":"7398","datestored":"2012-09-06T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2012-06-12T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"2","repnme":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Provincial Road Infrastructure\n            Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Argentina Provincial Road\n            Infrastructure Project aims to improve the reliability of\n            the Province's road sector assets and the efficiency of\n            their management as a means to support the Province's\n            competitiveness and economic growth, by building up\n            institutional capacity to encourage efficient planning\n            policies and adequate resource allocation for the\n            rehabilitation and maintenance of the core provincial road\n            network.
