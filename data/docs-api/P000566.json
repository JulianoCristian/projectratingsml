During 1993 and\n            1994, Congo suffered severe socio-political troubles due to\n            the escalating civil war throughout the country. This\n            increasingly difficult environment, the lack of counterpart\n            funds, and the continuing non-accrual status led the Bank to\n            postpone loan effectiveness several times. The country\n            eventually settled its arrears to the Bank on June 29, 1994,\n            which was just one day before the agreed loan closing date\n            of June 30, 1994. However, the drastic changes in the\n            country's circumstances in the four years following the\n            loan signing required a redesign of the project and the loan\n            was subsequently canceled on August 5, 1994 (effective June\n            30, 1994). The project's objectives were to support\n            government efforts to increase production efficiency and the\n            income of small traditional farmers by facilitating the\n            development of relevant agricultural technology and its\n            dissemination. Lessons learned from this project are: the\n            main risks identified in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)\n            were deficiency in local budgetary support and\n            implementation of the Training and Visit (T&V) system of\n            extension that may be hindered ineffective management and\n            lack of farmer incentives to adopt improved technical recommendations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo -
