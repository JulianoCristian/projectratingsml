The overall outcome of the Mining\n            Sector Development and Environment Project is assessed as\n            moderately satisfactory in light of the project's\n            continuing relevance and the substantial progress in its\n            capacity-building objective. However, the sustainability of\n            the capacity building achievements of the project is now in\n            doubt and overall project sustainability is rated unlikely.\n            Bank performance is assessed as satisfactory, albeit only\n            marginally, given shortcomings in the project's quality\n            at entry. Borrower performance is assessed as unsatisfactory\n            because the Government did not provide proper sector\n            leadership, failed to reform the Geological Survey\n            Department and latterly did not provide adequate funding for\n            the Minerals Commission to operate effectively. The main\n            lessons learned are: 1) Improving the legal and fiscal\n            framework for private investors can be highly effective in\n            attracting inflows of capital to the mining sector. 2)\n            Legalization of artisanal mining is desirable but needs to\n            be accompanied by measures to tax and control the\n            environmental damage caused by such mining. 3) Effective,\n            transparent, and equitable mechanisms for transferring\n            resources back to communities affected by large-scale mining\n            are essential sociopolitical tools to ensure that tangible\n            economic benefits are felt by local people and that mining\n            has legitimacy in the eyes of the public."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

Regardless of success, some\n            lessons learned convey the following. Technical assistance\n            is not an optimal instrument to implement a sector reform,\n            particularly as in this case, where policy issues and\n            restructuring requirements were not clearly identified, nor\n            agreed to by the Government, neither in the Staff Appraisal\n            Report, or Credit Agreement. Most importantly, and given the\n            fact that small-scale mining is a poverty-driven activity,\n            the project design should have accordingly, taken an\n            integrated approach, recognizing this fact as a\n            poverty-reduction component. As for project implementation,\n            it is important to have effective inter-ministerial, and\n            inter-agency coordination to ease the achievement of project\n            goals, since, as in this particular case, performance tends\n            to be affected by that of state agencies, generally\n            under-performing private sector standards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana

small-scale mining, enhancement of\n            small-scale activities, and increase of official earnings\n            enshrined in the project objectives have been effectively\n            achieved.  However, two of the objectives, namely: improving\n            mining skills, and access to equipment and capital, have not\n            been effectively addressed.  Marketing of the precious\n            minerals by small-scale mining leaves much to be desired.\n            The study recommends the following: 1) more mineral lands of\n            the large scale mining concerns be released to small-scale\n            miners; 2) the project should form small groupings or\n            cooperatives of small-scale miners to enable them to benefit\n            from credit, tools and equipment lease or high-purchase; 3)\n            the government should amend the small scale gold mining law\n            to include limited prospecting and \"blasting\", and\n            the inclusion of other precious metals; 4) marketing; 5)\n            relationship between the project and the Precious Minerals\n            Marketing Corporation (PMMC) should be streamlined to\n            encourage transparency; 6) relationship between Mines\n            Department and District Administration should be streamlined\n            to ensure success of the second phase of the project; and 7)\n            there should be proper needs assessment of the project\n            officers to enable the project to develop a training programme."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana
