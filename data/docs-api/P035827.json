This restructuring proposes particularly to address\n            targeting of the under-three year old children, and the\n            intergenerational malnutrition cycle by focusing on\n            reduction of adolescent anemia on a large scale in the\n            project states. It will also facilitate program\n            decentralization in order to strengthen field level\n            institutional and technical capacities. This restructuring\n            also proposes to consolidate gains made by earlier IDA\n            assisted projects and initiate dialogue for new assistance.\n            Specifically the restructuring will follow the following\n            guiding principles:1) improving access of the Integrated\n            Child Development Services Program (ICDS) to the poorest\n            households; 2)  targeting under-three year old children\n            especially by focusing on improving home based infant\n            feeding practices; 3)  implementing Communications for\n            Behavior Change (CBC) effectively; and 4) implementing the\n            Adolescent Girls' Component effectively. This amendment\n            is retroactive from November 1, 200 with a view that the\n            bifurcated states (Chhattisgarh from Madhya Pradesh and\n            Jharkhand from Bihar) be funded eligible service delivery\n            and program support activities from their date of creation,\n            and the states of Madhya Pradesh and Bihar be funded\n            eligible service delivery and program support activities\n            that could not be funded under the Bank assisted ICDS II\n            project (Cr. 2470-IN) as IDA was reallocated to the Gujarat\n            Earthquake Reconstruction Program. The proposal reduces the\n            original rupee outlays of the current five project states to\n            emphasize performance based funding. There is a 74% downward\n            revision in the category for medicines and medical supplies\n            and a 54% upward revision in the category for civil works.\n            The medicine kits are now being funded out of the\n            government's planned budget. There is a 99% upward\n            revision in incremental operating and maintenance cost.\n            Finally, based on the lessons learnt from earlier IDA\n            assistance to ICDS, this restructuring proposes to reassess\n            the ICDS program at the macro level, as well as review the\n            Bank's project design, for example, drop the legal\n            covenant on supplementary feeding and emphasize instead on a\n            behavior change communication strategy within the existing\n            training and other quality improvement components.\n            Accordingly, revised key performance monitoring indicators\n            have been agreed with the borrower. Baseline and end line\n            data from Bank assisted projects has provided additional\n            analysis of the program/project impact.

This restructuring proposes particularly to address\n            targeting of the under-three year old children, and the\n            intergenerational malnutrition cycle by focusing on\n            reduction of adolescent anemia on a large scale in the\n            project states. It will also facilitate program\n            decentralization in order to strengthen field level\n            institutional and technical capacities. This restructuring\n            also proposes to consolidate gains made by earlier IDA\n            assisted projects and initiate dialogue for new assistance.\n            Specifically the restructuring will follow the following\n            guiding principles:1) improving access of the Integrated\n            Child Development Services Program (ICDS) to the poorest\n            households; 2)  targeting under-three year old children\n            especially by focusing on improving home based infant\n            feeding practices; 3)  implementing Communications for\n            Behavior Change (CBC) effectively; and 4) implementing the\n            Adolescent Girls' Component effectively. This amendment\n            is retroactive from November 1, 200 with a view that the\n            bifurcated states (Chhattisgarh from Madhya Pradesh and\n            Jharkhand from Bihar) be funded eligible service delivery\n            and program support activities from their date of creation,\n            and the states of Madhya Pradesh and Bihar be funded\n            eligible service delivery and program support activities\n            that could not be funded under the Bank assisted ICDS II\n            project (Cr. 2470-IN) as IDA was reallocated to the Gujarat\n            Earthquake Reconstruction Program. The proposal reduces the\n            original rupee outlays of the current five project states to\n            emphasize performance based funding. There is a 74% downward\n            revision in the category for medicines and medical supplies\n            and a 54% upward revision in the category for civil works.\n            The medicine kits are now being funded out of the\n            government's planned budget. There is a 99% upward\n            revision in incremental operating and maintenance cost.\n            Finally, based on the lessons learnt from earlier IDA\n            assistance to ICDS, this restructuring proposes to reassess\n            the ICDS program at the macro level, as well as review the\n            Bank's project design, for example, drop the legal\n            covenant on supplementary feeding and emphasize instead on a\n            behavior change communication strategy within the existing\n            training and other quality improvement components.\n            Accordingly, revised key performance monitoring indicators\n            have been agreed with the borrower. Baseline and end line\n            data from Bank assisted projects has provided additional\n            analysis of the program/project impact. This will form the\n            basis for dialogue with the Government of India for further\n            assistance to ICDS. However, the stated development\n            objectives of this project still remain relevant to this\n            restructured phase."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Woman and Child Development Project\n            : proposed restructuring and amendment of the loan agreement"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Woman and Child\n            Development Project : proposed restructuring and amendment\n            of the loan agreement"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/01/2944512/india-woman-child-development-project-proposed-restructuring-amendment-loan-agreement","projn":"IN-Women & Child Development -- P035827","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Early Child and Children's Health,Educational Sciences,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Health Economics & Finance","docty":"Board Report","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040212173812"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Pre-primary education,Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Board Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"achievement,anemia,Behavior Change,Child\n            Development,childhood education,cost effectiveness,early\n            childhood,early childhood\n            education,education,girls,health,human\n            development,ICR,infant\n            feeding,intervention,iron,learning,malnutrition,medicines,moderate\n            child malnutrition,negotiation,nutrition status,old\n            children,performance indicators,performance\n            monitoring,poverty alleviation,productivity,quality of\n            services,service delivery,service quality,social development,targeting"},"1":{"cdata!":"achievement,anemia,Behavior Change,Child\n            Development,childhood education,cost effectiveness,early\n            childhood,early childhood\n            education,education,girls,health,human\n            development,ICR,infant\n            feeding,intervention,iron,learning,malnutrition,medicines,moderate\n            child malnutrition,negotiation,nutrition status,old\n            children,performance indicators,performance\n            monitoring,poverty alleviation,productivity,quality of\n            services,service delivery,service quality,social development,targeting"}},"owner":"S.A.
