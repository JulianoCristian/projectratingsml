The Bank and borrower performance\n            were moderately satisfactory. The risk to development\n            outcome was high. Significant changes included restructuring\n            of the project, and amending the Development Credit\n            Agreement to: (i) eliminate counterpart financing  and\n            reallocate the proceeds; and (ii) revise the closing date of\n            the project.  Several lessons were learned. Project design\n            must balance a range of considerations. These include the\n            desired outcomes, the financing instrument, and the\n            implementation arrangements. Risk assessment is an essential\n            aspect of project design. While overall risk was rated as\n            high, the components of this rating were underestimated and\n            the mitigation measures were insufficient. Where ministry\n            leadership is inadequate, other champions must be found to\n            advance the project's objectives. The Bank's\n            comparative advantages need to be recognized and exploited.\n            There is a need to temper expectations that a single health\n            project can impact the entire health sector. While a single\n            project financed by the Bank may be a necessary condition\n            for sectoral change, it is not sufficient without greater\n            political leadership and financial commitment from the\n            Guinean authorities. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) can\n            be improved throughout the project. Though the general\n            prescription is that M&E systems, including arrangements\n            for collecting and analyzing data, should be established\n            prior to project launch, Guinea shows that projects can\n            recover from inadequate M&E design and early\n            implementation weaknesses."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Health Sector Support

The changes are as follows: (i) a revision\n            of Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and related\n            indicators; (ii) a streamlining of project activities; (iii)\n            a revision of institutional arrangements; (iv) a\n            reallocation of credit proceeds; and (v) an extension of the\n            closing date. The expected outcome of the restructuring will\n            be a more effective project implementation resulting in an\n            improvement in mother and child health services in the 18\n            poorest districts of Guinea and 16 health centers in the\n            poorest peri-urban areas of Conakry, leading eventually to\n            reductions in maternal and child mortality and improvements\n            in health status."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Health Sector Support Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Health Sector Support\n            Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/12/15585539/guinea-health-sector-support-project-restructuring","projn":"GN-Health Sector Support Project -- P065126","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Population Policies,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Guinea","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20111229002541"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"antenatal care, basic health care, bulletin,\n            C-Sections, Capacity building, child health, child health\n            services, child mortality, communes, community health,\n            deaths, decision making, Development Objectives, Diphtheria,\n            districts, doctors, drugs, expenditures, female, Financial\n            Management, financial situation, health care, health care\n            services, health centers, health expenditures, health\n            facilities, health indicators, health information, health\n            information system, Health infrastructures, health\n            insurance, health insurance scheme, health outcomes, Health\n            posts, HEALTH SECTOR, health sector reform, health service,\n            health service delivery, health status, health system,\n            Health Training, health workers, HIV, HIV/AIDS, hospitals,\n            human resources, Illnesses, improvements in health, infant,\n            infant mortality, information system, Integration, malaria,\n            Maternal mortality, Measles, midwives, Millennium\n            Development Goals, Ministry of Health, mortality, mortality\n            reduction, Mosquito nets, Mother, Mother-to-Child,\n            Mother-to-Child Transmission, national health, national\n            health insurance, nurses, obstetrical care, policy dialogue,\n            pregnant women, private sector, progress, public\n            administration, Quality of Care, refugees, Reproductive\n            Health, rural areas, sanitation, security situation, service\n            delivery, skilled personnel, social sector, Technical\n            Assistance, Tetanus, Trainings, under-five mortality, UNFPA,\n            United Nations Population Fund, urban areas, Vaccination,\n            vaccines, Waste, workers"}},"owner":"Hlth, Nutr & Pop.
