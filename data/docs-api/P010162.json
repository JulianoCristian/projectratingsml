The findings of the reassessment are based\n            substantially on responses to an OED-sponsored survey of 200\n            households. The reassessment rates the outcome as highly\n            unsatisfactory, based on the modest relevance of the\n            project's development objectives, modest progress in\n            achieving those objectives and negligible efficiency. The\n            sustainability of the project's net benefit stream is\n            rated unlikely given the cutbacks in government spending on\n            operation and maintenance, the failure of water user groups\n            to become financially self-sustaining, the lack of\n            diversification into higher-margin crops, land tenure\n            insecurity, and the overall stagnation of incomes. The\n            project's institutional development impact is rated\n            negligible based on the project's failure to address\n            constraints in the incentive regime and the lack of\n            consideration to strengthening water user groups. The\n            performance of both Bank and borrower is rated\n            unsatisfactory because of the lack of attention during\n            preparation and implementation to containing costs and\n            ensuring the technical and economic viability of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Third Mahaweli Ganga Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Third Mahaweli Ganga\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4953742/sri-lanka-third-mahaweli-ganga-development-project","projn":"LK-Mahaweli Ganga III -- P010162","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Health Economics & Finance,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Sri Lanka","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040720112526"},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural extension,agricultural\n            productivity,agriculture,aquifers,cereals,climate,cocoa,coffee,cooperatives,crop,crop\n            diversification,crop\n            yields,cropping,crops,cultivation,drainage,drainage\n            infrastructure,economic feasibility\n            studies,entitlements,equipment,exchange\n            rate,families,Farm,farm employment,farm households,farm\n            income,farm incomes,farm land,farm produce,farm\n            work,Farmer,farmer incomes,Farmer\n            Organizations,farmers,farming,farms,feasibility\n            studies,fruits,grain,habitat,imports,income\n            distribution,inflation,integrated rural\n            development,livelihoods,living standards,marketing,natural\n            resource management,natural resources,paddy,plantations,poor\n            farmers,poverty line,price changes,productivity\n            growth,property rights,rice,rice prices,rice\n            production,schools,social services,spices,sustainable\n            use,timber,trees,unemployment,vegetables,water supply,wood,yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural extension,agricultural\n            productivity,agriculture,aquifers,cereals,climate,cocoa,coffee,cooperatives,crop,crop\n            diversification,crop\n            yields,cropping,crops,cultivation,drainage,drainage\n            infrastructure,economic feasibility\n            studies,entitlements,equipment,exchange\n            rate,families,Farm,farm employment,farm households,farm\n            income,farm incomes,farm land,farm produce,farm\n            work,Farmer,farmer incomes,Farmer\n            Organizations,farmers,farming,farms,feasibility\n            studies,fruits,grain,habitat,imports,income\n            distribution,inflation,integrated rural\n            development,livelihoods,living standards,marketing,natural\n            resource management,natural resources,paddy,plantations,poor\n            farmers,poverty line,price changes,productivity\n            growth,property rights,rice,rice prices,rice\n            production,schools,social services,spices,sustainable\n            use,timber,trees,unemployment,vegetables,water supply,wood,yields"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"29489"},"727381":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1994/12/727381/sri-lanka-irrigation-projects","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1994/12/727381/sri-lanka-irrigation-projects","new_url":"1994/12/727381/sri-lanka-irrigation-projects","disclosure_type":"NA","disclstat":"Eligible for Disclosure","docm_id":"090224b0828a608f","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0828a608f","docdt":"1994-12-29T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2003-04-10T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Irrigation Projects"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Irrigation Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Irrigation Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/12/727381/sri-lanka-irrigation-projects","projn":"LK-Village Irrig.

Institutional development objectives were\n            only partially achieved and sustainability is uncertain.\n            However, both the Bank and Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, farmer organizations need to be developed to\n            assume more of the responsibility of the O&M (Operation\n            and Maintenance). Second, institutional capacity needs to be\n            strengthened in order to tackle environmental issues. Third,\n            the Bank should organize a project launch workshop so that\n            operational responsibilities can be clearly defined and\n            understood by implementing agencies. Fourth, the Bank should\n            have given more consideration to the ability of the project\n            organization to implement all the activities envisaged.\n            Fifth, the Borrower should complete major design works and\n            surveys before credit effectiveness.
