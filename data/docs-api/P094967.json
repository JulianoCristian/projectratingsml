To\n            support longer-term policy reforms it is worthwhile to have\n            a multi-year program design that allows some flexibility in\n            the program. A DPL program series instead of a single DPL\n            provides an opportunity for continued policy dialogue and\n            support reforms over longer time. A DPL that is focused on a\n            small number of related sectors, such as Human Development,\n            provides a comprehensive and cohesive approach for the Bank\n            to support a Government's reform agenda. A limited\n            sector DPL is also easier to manage for the Bank than a DPL\n            with many sectors. Such a cohesive approach intensifies the\n            policy dialogue in a sector which could lead to better\n            quality benchmarks and coherent reforms. Despite the higher\n            cost related to it, the upfront investment in analytical\n            work and policy notes in the preparation phase can help to\n            set the reform framework and embed a DPL program in a\n            country's national strategy. Investment lending\n            projects can further supported these analytical works.\n            Strong management support from the Bank at the beginning of\n            an operation with Senior Management participating in the\n            DPL1 preparation phase can help to get the buy-in from the\n            Government and country unit for a DPL program.\n            Decentralization of head quarter staff to the field ensures\n            a close and continued dialogue with the Government and other\n            partners throughout the program series."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria -
