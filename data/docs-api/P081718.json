This experience\n            suggests that more attention needs to be given to the\n            sequencing of reforms. The Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            (PRSC) program was perhaps too overloaded with\n            \"politically-sensitive\" reforms, i.e., public\n            sector, welfare, labor, and land reforms; rather a more\n            phased approach could have been more manageable. Thus,\n            further consideration should also be given towards ensuring\n            wide-base political support for key reforms, and avoid\n            interruptions every time there is a change in government.\n            This is why governments need to be encouraged to pursue\n            reforms that have bipartisan support, i.e., to enhance\n            consultations with relevant stakeholders, including within\n            government. Other lessons address the recent poverty\n            numbers, which show a sharp increase in inequality between\n            1990-91 and 2002, also reinforcing the importance of\n            focusing on pro-poor reforms, e.g., welfare reforms and\n            rural development, to be the center of the second PRSC\n            operation. Moreover, it is important that future PRSC\n            operations be closely linked to the budget, and, given the\n            difficulties in passing legislative changes, should legal\n            changes be included in the program, careful consideration\n            needs to be given to the constitutionality of the proposed\n            legislations, and whether they could withstand court\n            challenges. Unfortunately, while this operation did\n            (substantially) achieve its objectives, the results are much\n            less satisfactory than they would have been if the intended\n            complementary reforms, originally planned to be supported in\n            subsequent operations, had actually materialized."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - First Poverty Reduction Support\n

The\n            findings and implications show that the recent political\n            developments reinforce the importance of linking the release\n            of Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC) funds to the\n            effective implementation of up-front actions and not to\n            future promises. Recent poverty numbers, which show a sharp\n            increase in inequality between 1990-91 and 2002, also\n            reinforce the need to focus on pro-poor reforms, e.g.,\n            welfare reforms and rural development. It is important that\n            future PRSC operations be more closely linked to the budget.\n            In this regard, the Bank team is working with the MOF to\n            enhance the policy orientation of the budget through the\n            development of a medium term budget framework. To ensure the\n            sustainability of reforms, the new government needs to be\n            encouraged to enhance consultations with relevant\n            stakeholders, including those within the government, and to\n            inform the public at large of the pros and cons of reforms,\n            perhaps through a more systematic communications strategy.\n            Given the difficulties in passing legislative changes, which\n            in Sri Lanka's context could be subject to court\n            challenges, future operations will need to explore\n

This Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) Project\n            is designed to support the implementation of Sri\n            Lanka's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). This\n            operation, PRSC I, would be the first of a series of annual\n            PRSCs within a rolling four-year horizon, overlapping with\n            Sri Lanka's PRS period. Consistent with the Government\n            objectives and priorities, the PRSCs would support reforms\n            in two major areas: 1 ) accelerating economic growth and\n            supporting private sector development; and, (2)\n            strengthening governance in the public sector and improving\n            the welfare system. This PRSC will help the Government in\n            moving forward with the structural reforms, create\n            conditions for accelerating economic growth, and send a\n            strong signal to the private sector. Furthermore, it will\n            foster a continued fiscal consolidation, improve public\n            sector governance, and, strengthen institutional framework\n            and capacity in the management of public resources. These\n            developments would also lead to improvements in the\n            poverty-focus of public expenditures. Nevertheless, there\n            are several risks: (a) the derailment of the peace process;\n            (b) a substantial deterioration of external environment; (c)\n            potential for domestic political instability, since Sri\n            Lanka is going through a period of political\n            \"cohabitation\"--a President from one party, and a\n            Government from another; and, (d) resistance by labor unions\n            to some economic reforms. Risks however, are mitigated by\n            the design of the credit, and by the Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS) triggers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - First Poverty Reduction
