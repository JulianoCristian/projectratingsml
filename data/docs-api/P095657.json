Some lessons learned included: first, there is\n            no avoiding conditionality. Good practice principles of\n            policy-based lending are now routinely stated in almost\n            every operation and have become second nature in designing\n            policy-based operations. Donors should reinforce government\n            ownership by supporting rather than duplicating government\n            processes (aid harmonization among donors, alignment of aid\n            with the budget cycle, use of government procurement\n            processes, etc.). There should be an accountability\n            framework that guides both government and donors. Prior\n            Actions (as conditions of disbursement) should be few but\n            critical to the achievement of agreed results. Progress\n            reviews should be transparent and conducive to\n            performance-based, predictable budget support. Second,\n            unlike investment lending operations, PRSCs are able, in\n            principle, to deal with complex cross-cutting issues when\n            the Government has the requisite technical and coordination\n            capacities and the operations are supplemented by sector\n            Investment Loans (ILs), Technical Assistance (TA) and\n            competent analytical work. If the coordination and technical\n            capacities are limited, interventions in complex\n            cross-cutting areas have to be prioritized and sequenced.\n            Over time, as capacities get stronger, the number of complex\n            interventions can be increased. This is an area in which\n            wishful thinking often replaces hard-nosed realism, and\n            results in less than acceptable outcomes. Third, committed\n            political leadership makes a difference. Yet, even the best\n            leadership can only accomplish so much in a given time\n            period. It must overcome ever-present vested interests, old\n            mind-sets and ingrained behaviors, even assuming that\n            technical and organizational capacities are adequate. This\n            is a tricky area. There are often AAA products (as was the\n            case with a string of policy notes in Tanzania) that\n            identify aspects of these issues and there is anecdotal\n            evidence. But the job of transforming that knowledge into\n            successful interventions ultimately falls to the government.\n            The donors can at best figure out what actions are likely to\n            succeed and back them, or decide that the government is\n            unlikely to follow through and back off. It is extremely\n            difficult to get that balance right. Tanzania has been no\n            exception. Finally, measuring outcomes is important in order\n            to increase focus and accountability. Realistic, focused\n            monitoring frameworks that track progress over time towards\n            ultimate objectives, concentrate the mind of government as\n            well as the donors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and\n            Eigth Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Fourth Poverty\n

PRSC-4, which was\n            approved by the World Bank's Board on May 9, 2006,\n            presented the five year PRSC program in support of the\n            MKUKUTA. The Bank's PRSC support to Tanzania is\n            provided within a framework for general budget support\n            (GBS), comprising a Performance Assessment Framework (PAF),\n            a Partnership Framework Memorandum (PFM) for GBS for the\n            implementation o f MKUKUTA, and a streamlined review\n            process.
