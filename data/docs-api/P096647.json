Some lessons learned\n            included: earmarked funding can be effective to increase\n            participation of targeted segments of community groups. The\n            validity of this lesson was demonstrated by the successful\n            implementation of the women's empowerment program.\n            Efficient use of funds for disaster relief programs requires\n            coordination with long-term development plans.
