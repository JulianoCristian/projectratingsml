Some lessons learned included: surface\n            dressings are an excellent way to treat some types of\n            pavement problems at low cost, but require special care in\n            their application. During project preparation, the Estonia\n            Road Administration (ERA) planned to purchase all of the\n            bitumen and aggregate in bulk in order to assure adequate\n            quality and to get what it assumed will be a better price\n            than if each contractor bought his own materials. In the\n            initial stages of project planning, the ERA thought that it\n            will be necessary to procure equipment for the privatized\n            firms that will be bidding on the civil works component,\n            since most of the equipment in the country was old and not\n            of good quality. This project demonstrated that road\n            maintenance costs can be carried out at levels considerable\n            lower than thought by other country road maintenance\n            organizations, some other lending institutions, some\n            consultants, and other parts of the Bank. Frequent visits to\n            Finland, the presence of Finnish highway engineers during\n            contract supervision, the constant exchange of information,\n            and the access to Finnish used road construction equipment\n            at favorable prices all contributed to the establishment of\n            a relationship that will no doubt extend well beyond the\n            life of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Estonia -
