Some lessons\n            learned included: success was more noticeable in areas which\n            coincided with Government's own priorities and where\n            Bank had other instruments to engage outside the Poverty\n            Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) framework. This is quite\n            evident in the declining overall performance of the\n            Government on Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)\n            indicators in the past few years. There are several reasons\n            behind this conclusion. One, the PAF document itself is the\n            outcome of protracted negotiations and compromises between\n            different groups of donors and the Government. As such it\n            reflects the minimum common denominator as to what can be\n            achieved and is unlikely to be a true reflection of\n            Government's most strongly held priorities. Two, the\n            context of budget support in Zambia has changed; ODA has\n            declined dramatically as a share of Government's\n            resources and unless the PAF mimics Government's\n            strongly held priorities, it will have limited impact. The\n            Bank should manage transitions within the Bank team more\n            systematically. This is indeed a very general point but in\n            this particular case it became very important. The\n            Bank's absence from key PAF revision discussions due to\n            staff transition had significant implications for the PRSC.\n            It led to a misalignment between PAF and PRSC and strained\n            relations between the Bank, donors and government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - First, Second, and Third Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credits

           Credit (PRSC) operation supports two objectives: a) preserve\n            macroeconomic stability and to improve public sector\n            performance, and b) support broad-based growth by improving\n            the efficiency in the energy sector and reducing the cost of\n            doing business. The PRSC is aligned with the Bank's\n            Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Zambia for the period\n            2008-2011. The CAS identifies direct budget support as the\n            primary instrument to assist Zambia in achieving its reform\n            program and maximizing the impact of its poverty reduction\n            strategy. The PRSC process also provides a forum for ongoing\n            policy dialogue with the government and other major\n            stakeholders; it promotes coordination between the\n            government and the donor community and complements the\n            continuing efforts of other cooperating partners. As a\n            result, economic growth has not generated the expanded\n            employment opportunities and increased income necessary for\n            further poverty reduction. Zambia must successfully\n            diversify growth across labor-intensive, pro-poor sectors if\n            the country is to make significant progress in achieving its\n            poverty
