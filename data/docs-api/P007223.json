The lessons learned indicate that rural\n            communities can effectively and transparently manage\n            resources transferred by the central level and can hire\n            teachers following established procedures regardless of the\n            participants' educational level. Scaling-up\n            implementation of programs is important, particularly as\n            demonstrated by the multi-grade methodologies model.\n            Satisfactory results reached by the Project are largely due\n            to a sustained continuity in project coordination. Project\n            execution benefited by the application of a decentralized\n            administration of project activities, with the Project\n            Coordination Unit's (PCU's) main function as a\n            coordinating unit rather than the main implementer of\n            project activities. It is necessary to (i) provide timely\n            and relevant training to personnel in the operational units\n            of the Ministry responsible for the administrative and\n            financial areas; and (ii) permanently assign these technical\n            teams so that they can take charge of the implementation of\n            project activities, rather than have staff assigned\n            temporarily to activities but with the risk of constantly\n            losing them to other assignments. It is beneficial for\n            project execution if the Operations Manual of the Project is\n            adhered to closely. The Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) must\n            intensify efforts to take advantage of the favorable\n            atmosphere that exists in the country to increase budgetary\n            allocations destined to the education sector. The opening of\n            a special account in the Bank of Guatemala and hiring United\n            Nations Development Program (UNDP) as procurement agent,\n            helped to ease the administrative procedures for disbursing\n            resources from the loan and contributed to greater\n            transparency in the procurement and hiring processes. In\n            order to optimize the use of the resources and to reach the\n            goals and objectives of the MINEDUC, the activities and\n            programs of the Ministry should be systematic and timely."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Basic Education Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala - Basic Education\n            Reform

of school; a focus on gender equity,\n            bilingual education and decentralization of education\n            administration to encourage greater community participation;\n            and geographic focus on those areas most affected by decades\n            of internal conflict before the December, 1996 Peace\n            Accords. The project seeks to raise coverage and equity, the\n            first component, through increased pre-primary and primary\n            school enrollment in the poorest rural areas, emphasizing\n            reaching indigenous groups and girls by (a) expanding the\n            National Community-managed Program for Educational\n            Development; (b) offering afternoon shifts in existing\n            schools; and (c) expanding the \"Programa de la\n            Nina.\" The second component seeks to improve efficiency\n            and quality of rural basic education, resulting in reduced\n            drop-out and repetition rates, and improved student academic\n            achievement, mainly by supporting bilingual and multigrade\n            teaching methodologies. The third component seeks to\n            strengthen the organization and management of the education\n            ministry's normative and policymaking functions at the\n            central level, and support functions at the intermediate and\n            local levels, with community involvement in day-to-day\n            school organization and management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala -
