The ratings for the Financial Sector Adjustment\n            Loan (FSAL) Project for Ukraine were as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was negligible\n            to low; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Major lessons from FSAL\n            are the importance of a sound legislative and regulatory\n            framework in the financial system, and the greater role of\n            the country's overall economic performance, as well as\n            market forces, than of formal technical assistance, in\n            achieving improvements in specific financial institutions.\n            In particular:, (i) establishing a sound legislative and\n            regulatory framework for the financial sector is a\n            necessary, but not sufficient, condition for financial\n            sector development; (ii) strengthening the supervisory and\n            enforcement capacity of the supervisory agency is essential\n            to achieve the benefits of a sound legal and regulatory\n            frame; (iii) technical assistance to strengthen poor\n            performing institutions has poor results without a strong\n            demand-pull, mainly from market forces; and (iv)\n            restructuring and improving the performance of state-owned\n            financial institutions is a slow and risky proposition in a\n            poor governance environment. The ratings for the First and\n            Second Programmatic Adjust Loan projects (PAL I and PAL II)\n            are as follows: outcome sustainability was satisfactory,\n            risk to development outcome was negligible to low, Bank\n            performance for PAL I was satisfactory while it was\n            moderately satisfactory for PAL II.  Three major categories\n            of lessons emerge from this assessment of the PAL program:\n            links and complementarity between the PAL program and\n            investment lending need reinforcing, politically difficult\n            issues are noticeable during the early stages of program\n            implementation and when crucial to the success of the\n            program should

substantial, resulting from a highly\n            satisfactory Bank performance, and satisfactory Borrower\n            performance. Several lessons were drawn from this operation:\n            a) adjustment lending programs work well when based on the\n            government's own priorities, and when the government\n            owns the process. This is particularly important if the\n            program involves a wide range of activities, and, in\n            addition, having a long-term adjustment program consisting\n            of three programmatic adjustment lending operations, may\n            ensure sustainability against government backtracking,\n            giving an opportunity to see the progress and direction of\n            the program, and also the flexibility to make modifications,\n            to adapt the program to changing circumstances. Furthermore,\n            it is important to ensure an adequate technical background\n            work, fostering sufficient capacity and understanding of\n            issues on the government's side. Given that adjustment\n            programs are built upon the government's program, and\n            with the government as a counterpart, thus vulnerable to\n            changes in government and political instability,\n            constituencies for reforms may also need to be rebuilt. A\n            cross-cutting, thematic design provides both flexibility,\n            and depth for addressing systemic institutional reform,\n            which within its framework, and recognizing the stepwise\n            nature of reform progress, the approach provides discipline\n            because there is a pre-agreed program of needed, and\n            complementary reforms which are to be addressed within the\n            programmatic package. Finally, the concept of benchmarks, as\n            opposed to conditionality, serves two purposes: (a) it takes\n            the Bank out of the delicate situation of imposing terms and\n            conditions; and, (b) lowers the risk of the project, in the\n            sense that the outcomes are already achieved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Programmatic Adjustment Loan

program in Ukraine, to set the basis for sustained\n            economic growth, poverty reduction, and improved\n            environmental protection. The project will further improve\n            fiscal, and financial discipline, by eliminating\n            non-transparent budget off-sets, reducing budget arrears,\n            and increasing cash collections for energy. A more efficient\n            regulatory framework for entry, and operation of enterprises\n            will be in place, to improve corporate governance, and,\n            up-to-date regulatory functions in critical sectors will be\n            introduced. In the medium run, improved property rights will\n            form the basis for the revival of economic growth coming\n            from private investments, and foreign direct investments. In\n            addition, public sector accountability is being strengthened\n            through the public administration reforms, while, in the\n            medium term, completion of fiscal reforms will remain a\n            strong government commitment. And, completion of the pension\n            reform, and improved health and education services, will\n            help balance social assistance management. The highly\n            volatile political, and socioeconomic environment are risks\n            not to be underestimated, given the project's aim to\n            reduce budget arrears, and streamline
