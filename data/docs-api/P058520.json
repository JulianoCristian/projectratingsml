The lessons learned indicate that it is\n            important for the Bank to make the Borrower understand the\n            value-added of the Bank's involvement in Latvia, over\n            and above financing a project. Alignment of the project and\n            government policy, and continuity in reform objectives are\n            critical for the success of the project. Confidence and\n            communication among Project Coordination Unit (PCU), the\n            management of implementing agency and the Bank team are\n            critical for project's success. Transparency,\n            decentralization and open discussions are essential for\n            making important decisions related to the project. Project\n            design during implementation should have some flexibility.\n            Measures to ensure accessibility to health services. It is\n            important to ensure that the working groups are adequately\n            staffed and take primary responsibility for the technical\n            content of the various project components. The Bank should\n            explain clearly to the Borrower the relevance and\n            significance of the Bank's procurement rules and\n            procedures. There is a need for accurate costing of\n            procurement activities ex ante, and accurate preparation of\n            tender documents, particularly in the case of construction\n            works. There is a need for well trained, prepared and highly\n            motivated staff with clearly defined responsibilities to\n            make managerial decisions. State-of-the-art computer system\n            for financial management and management of the Project\n            proved important for good management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia - Health Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Latvia -

Parallel to\n            project preparation, a social assessment of poverty was\n            carried out to complement the project and a positive\n            environmental impact is expected to
