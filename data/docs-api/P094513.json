In the last decade, India has seen some\n            major disasters including the Bhuj earthquake in 2001 and\n            the tsunami in 2004. India has a coastline of 7,516 km\n            covering 13 coastal states and union territories, of which\n            5700 km are prone to cyclones of various degrees. The\n            coastal districts of Odisha are prone to frequent cyclonic\n            storms and concurrent flood hazards. The Odisha\n            Super-cyclone of 1999 killed over 8,900 people and 440,000\n            livestock, affected more than 15 million people and\n            disrupted over 2 million households across 14 districts of\n            the state. The Odisha state disaster management authority\n            (OSDMA) set up after the super cyclone of 1999 was the first\n            disaster mitigation authority set up in the country. India\n            in the last decade has also made significant strides in\n            moving from reactive emergency response to being proactive\n            and implementing disaster preparedness and risk reduction\n            initiatives. The use of Geographic Information System (GIS)\n            based mapping is playing a major role in achieving the\n            objectives of the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project\n            (NCRMP). It is helping in enhancing the effectiveness of\n            early warning dissemination systems and communication,\n            improving access and evacuation and in better locating infrastructure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project for\n            Orissa : application of GIS for cyclone risk mitigation infrastructure"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"National Cyclone Risk Mitigation\n            Project for Orissa : application of GIS for cyclone risk\n            mitigation infrastructure"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2013/02/17510363/national-cyclone-risk-mitigation-project-orissa-application-gis-cyclone-risk-mitigation-infrastructure","projn":"IN-India: Emergency Tsunami Reconstruction\n            Project -- P094513","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Geographical Information Systems,Hazard Risk Management,Technology Industry,Natural Disasters,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Industry,Urban Development,Environment","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20130401115954"},"theme":"Land administration and management,Social safety nets,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Natural disaster management","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Other social services,Housing construction,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","colti":"GFDRR project highlights ; no. 3","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Industry,Urban Development,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Action Plans, air dropping, Application\n            Centre, area, attributes, buffer, Capacity Building, CLIMATE\n            CHANGE, communities, components, connectivity, decision\n            support tool, Demographic information, Disaster, Disaster\n            Management, Disaster Mitigation, disaster preparedness,\n            disaster response, disaster risk, disasters, DRM, drought,\n            Early Warning, earthquake, earthquakes, emergency response,\n            emergency shelter, emergency shelters, evacuation, flood,\n            flooding, Geographic Information, Geographic Information\n            System, Geographical Information, GIS, GPS, images, Impact\n            Assessment, implementation plan, Information System,\n            installation, landslides, natural hazards, Photo, Project\n            Management, Reconstruction, relief, relief material, risk\n            reduction, Satellite, Satellite data, sites, social issues,\n            storm, storms, Technical Assistance, Tropical Cyclone,\n            Tsunami, Union, verification, victims, vulnerability study,\n            wind storms"}},"owner":"Urban, Water Supply & Sanitation (SASDU)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"76324"},"16552726":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/06/16552726/india-emergency-tsunami-reconstruction-project-etrp","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/06/16552726/india-emergency-tsunami-reconstruction-project-etrp","new_url":"2012/06/16552726/india-emergency-tsunami-reconstruction-project-etrp","disclosure_date":"2012-07-26T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-07-26T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-07-26T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/07/30/000333037_20120730022533/Rendered/INDEX/ICR22150P094510C0disclosed070260120.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/07/30/000333037_20120730022533/Rendered/PDF/ICR22150P094510C0disclosed070260120.pdf","credit_no":"4054","datestored":"2012-07-30T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2012-06-18T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"India - Emergency Tsunami Reconstruction\n            Project (ETRP)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Emergency Tsunami\n            Reconstruction Project (ETRP) for India were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: bank procedures for emergency projects aim to\n            substantially compress the preparation time. However,\n            planning mechanisms for facilitating speedier implementation\n            normally receive little attention. During preparation, the\n            Government and the Bank should also focus on how these\n            procedural delays can be minimized through special fiduciary\n            arrangements. The restructuring process focused on utilizing\n            the use of expected savings. This resulted in addition of a\n            completely new component vis-a-vis the original project\n            design. At that time, discussions should have been held with\n            the borrower on designing a new project focusing on disaster\n            risk reduction rather than combining reconstruction with\n            risk reduction. In ETRP, the housing component tended to be\n            the sole focus in the initial period of implementation. For\n            instance, the Government of India (GoI) and Government of\n            Pondicherry (GoPY) gave housing the top priority. Therefore,\n            the Project Implementation Agency (PIA) chose to sequence\n            implementation and deferred actions pertaining to the\n            fisheries and livelihood component. This has resulted in\n            incomplete outcomes in constructing the Fisheries\n            infrastructure even after six years of project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Emergency
