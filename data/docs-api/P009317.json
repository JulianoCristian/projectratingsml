The reason of the cancellation the\n            Borrower requested a shift in Technical Assistance (TA)\n            support from the Credit to grant assistance available from\n            United Nations Development Program and Indian Technical\n            Assistance programs. The country situation from 1980 on\n            curtailed all implementation activities and the project\n            cannot be rated. When a Borrower is faced with budgetary\n            constraints, it is more likely to seek grants to finance TA\n            than to use Credit funds.
