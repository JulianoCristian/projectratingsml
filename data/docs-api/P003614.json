Some lessons learned\n            included: project design and governance should carefully\n            consider the institutional capacity for each component and\n            recognize that progress may not occur in parallel. Major\n            challenges were experienced with the 'softer'\n            components due to weaker institutional capacity. The role of\n            a project leading group is essential to ensure that the\n            various components are implemented in a coordinated fashion,\n            but sustaining their interest and effective functioning is\n            difficult to achieve. Moreover, setting up institutional\n            capacity for what may be a short but intensive resettlement\n            or a prolonged environmental mitigation program demands\n            special care. Computer-based management systems require\n            exceptional inter-disciplinary coordination and specialized\n            experience for procurement. The technical complexity of\n            these systems, which often involve intellectual property\n            rights embodied in proprietary software, is complicated by\n            the procurement policies that aim to promote competition.\n            Close coordination is needed between specialists who\n            understand the business processes being computerized,\n            technology options, and procurement. A technical and\n            functional architecture encompassing the project is also\n            needed to ensure current and future system interoperability.\n            Guangzhou's Global Positioning Satellite (GPS)-based\n            bus dispatching and monitoring system, which also provides\n            real-time passenger information, was eventually scaled up to\n            the entire bus fleet and is a model for other cities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Guangzhou City Transport Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Guangzhou City Transport

Transport Project,\n            which comprises an express roadway planned to circle the\n            city center of Guangzhou Municipality. Mitigation measures\n            to curb negative environmental impacts resulting from this\n            project include traffic management to prevent congestion and\n            the resulting high motor vehicle emissions. Restrictions on\n            using noisy equipment, temporary enclosures with and without\n            absorption lining, regular vehicle and road inspections and\n            maintenance, and absorptive barriers constructed along road\n            sections are some of the measures to be used to reduce noise\n            during and after construction. Other mitigation options\n            recommended for alleviating noise received by social,\n            health, and educational institutions include using sound\n            absorbing pavement, erecting noise barricades, adding\n            vibration-reducing mounts on viaducts, planting trees and\n            establishing greenbelts as buffers, constructing pedestrian\n            overpasses and building walls, and insulating buildings with\n            double glass windows and ventilation systems. Runoff and\n            water pollutants from domestic sewage and industrial\n            wastewater flowing into the waterways will be alleviated by\n            efficient collection and treatment. Dust and exhaust impacts\n            can be combated by revegetation, reconstructing walls, and\n            installing dust cleaning facilities.

Mitigation measures\n            to curb negative environmental impacts resulting from this\n            project include traffic management to prevent congestion and\n            the resulting high motor vehicle emissions. Restrictions on\n            using noisy equipment, temporary enclosures with and without\n            absorption lining, regular vehicle and road inspections and\n            maintenance, and absorptive barriers constructed along road\n            sections are some of the measures to be used to reduce noise\n            during and after construction. Other mitigation options\n            recommended for alleviating noise received by social,\n            health, and educational institutions include using sound\n            absorbing pavement, erecting noise barricades, adding\n            vibration-reducing mounts on viaducts, planting trees and\n            establishing greenbelts as buffers, constructing pedestrian\n            overpasses and building walls, and insulating buildings with\n            double glass windows and ventilation systems. Runoff and\n            water pollutants from domestic sewage and industrial\n            wastewater flowing into the waterways will be alleviated by\n            efficient collection and treatment. Dust and exhaust impacts\n            can be combated by revegetation, reconstructing walls, and\n            installing dust cleaning facilities. Populations will be\n            resettled according to World Bank standards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Guangzhou City Center Transport\n            Project - environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China -
