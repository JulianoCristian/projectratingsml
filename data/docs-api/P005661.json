The general objectives and their level\n            of achievement are as follows:(a) improving OMVs'\n            capabilities to provide increased water delivery, in a\n            timely and cost-effective manner, and to maintain existing\n            irrigation systems: substantial achievement; (b) introducing\n            pricing and cost recovery policies for OMVs' services,\n            in particular irrigation water, aimed at: (i) a more\n            rational use of available resources; (ii) increased\n            competition from the private and cooperative sectors; and\n            (iii) greater financial autonomy of OMVs: substantial\n            achievement, except the financial OMV autonomy due to the\n            dispersion of OMV structures into the CRDA; (c) setting up\n            an institutional framework providing for: (i) improved\n            managementefficiency and greater accountability for OMVs;\n            and (ii) strengthened planning and control capabilities for\n            Government services in charge of monitoring OMVs'\n            operations: negligible achievement due to the dispersion of\n            OMV structures into the CRDA; and (d) increasing the role\n            and responsibilities of Water User Associations in the\n            O&M irrigation systems: partial achievement. The major\n            lessons learnt during project implementation are as follows:\n            i) project size should always be in accordance with the\n            absorptive capacity of the executing agency as well as of\n            the ultimate beneficiaries; ii) when recurrent costs are a\n            substantial part of total project costs, often the case in\n            irrigation projects, specific commitments for the financing\n            of the former should be worked out before project start; iv)\n            at appraisal stage, the design of a proper\n            monitoring/evaluations ystem should be a critical element of\n            any project, particularly those which are nation-wide and\n            mainly composed of rehabilitation and/or restructuring\n            activities; v) the number of actions requested to be\n            reflected in Loan covenants should be limited, and only\n            priority conditionalities strictly necessary to assure\n            proper implementation of the project mentioned; and vi) when\n            the institutional arrangements previously agreed upon are\n            substantially changed during project execution, as the case\n            arose with the reorganization of the Ministry of\n            Agriculture, the new situation should be formally reviewed\n            and the appropriate modifications made to the project design\n            and to the Loan Agreement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Irrigation Management Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Irrigation Management\n            Improvement Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/02/733603/tunisia-irrigation-management-improvement-project","topic":"Irrigation and Drainage Modernization and\n            Rehabilitation m1326422 997,Irrigation and Drainage Operation and\n            Maintenance m1327356 995,Agriculture Technology m1326423 1950,Public Sector Management m1326314 696","projn":"TN-Natl.
