Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are judged satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include the following: Forest research must\n            be designed as an integral part of project activities to\n            ensure coherence between priorities of the research team,\n            administration, and end-users. For results to be meaningful,\n            research must be demand-driven and responsive to the needs\n            of end-users. Integrating research into the overall project\n            also creates stronger links between the operational agency\n            and the research institutes, which results in a research\n            program consistent with sector development needs, Technical\n            solutions that are simple and easy are likely to be adopted\n            and accepted more easily. Decentralization of project\n            management functions can lead to more efficient project\n            implementation. Also, it allows for capacity building to\n            benefit a larger number of people. A computerized monitoring\n            and evaluation system must be developed for the regions to\n            minimize multiple and manual handling of data and minimize\n            errors. The use of a participatory approach in an\n            inexperienced agency requires extensive capacity building,\n            and should include techniques for knowledge sharing,\n            consensus building, and conflict resolution mechanisms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Second Forestry Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Second Forestry\n

To this end, the project will\n            include:  (a) execution of infrastructure, preparation of\n            management plans for environmental services and production\n            potential, silvicultural works for cork oak and aleppo pine\n            regeneration, and thinning operations of cork oak coppices,\n            young stands of natural aleppo pine, eucalyptus coppices,\n            and pine planation; (b) establishment of plantations on\n            National Forest Estate, stream banks plantations for\n            riparian protection, plantations on farmland, and\n            establishment and improvement of nurseries; (c)\n            establishment of prairies, shrub plantations, improved\n            natural rangeland, cactus plantations, and rehabilitation of\n            existing pastures, a training and technical assistance\n            program to help implement the component; (d) studies on fuel\n            wood, wood processing, wood minor forest products, and\n            provision of training programs in wood exploitation,\n            treatment, and sawing; (e) strengthening the equipment of\n            national parks and reserves and providing means to control\n            and protect wildlife; (f) supporting the implementation of a\n            research program focussing on testing forest biosystems; and\n            (g) strengthening forest related institutions at central and\n            regional levels to assist them in implementing the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Second Forestry Development
