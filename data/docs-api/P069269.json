Some lessons learned\n            included: to be more effective a community-driven\n            development (CDD) approach needs to link income generating\n            activities with efforts to improve social inclusion. The\n            various qualitative and quantitative analyses undertaken\n            demonstrated that the project had tangible economic\n            achievements while staying true to a participatory,\n            bottom-up model. While not without complications in\n            execution, the project's achievements show that\n            bringing beneficiaries and their communities more centrally\n            into development processes will not sacrifice either\n            efficiency or productivity, as some CDD critics assert. It\n            is important to create and maintain simple and accessible\n            social accountability mechanisms to increase the likelihood\n            of long-term project sustainability and build trust among\n            beneficiaries. Such instruments that community members can\n            use to hold managers, decision makers, and the project\n            itself to account, like participatory monitoring and regular\n            web publication of project documents, make project processes\n            transparent, as well as identify areas for improvement. Such\n            systems that clarify resource allocation, make clear\n            participation opportunities, and provide channels for\n            citizen feedback, help achieve development goals as well as\n            build the public's confidence that the Government and\n            its partners can be both inclusive and evenhanded in its\n            provision of services. It is important to build upon\n            existing institutional arrangements and try to strengthen\n            them even if creating new systems from scratch would appear\n            to facilitate project implementation in the short term. For\n            long term viability of income generating development\n            initiatives, it is important to be connected to locally\n            developed systems because such organizational structures,\n            like local development committees, if properly supported,\n            can be a hub that connects public institutions, local\n            government, business, civil society and citizens, and\n            grounds a project in the long run."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Pilot Community Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Paraguay - Pilot Community\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/11/11528618/paraguay-pilot-community-development-project","projn":"PY-Pilot Community Development Project -- P069269","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Banks & Banking Reform,Housing & Human Habitats,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Paraguay","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20091217232111"},"theme":"Improving labor markets,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural non-farm income generation,Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring,Participation and civic engagement","subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,General industry and trade sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to services, accountability,\n            accounting, accounting practices, Action Plan,\n            administrative capacity, administrative challenges,\n            Agriculture Organization, approval procedures, artisan,\n            Auditing, audits, Bank financing, Bank Lending, Bank\n            Ratings, Bank supervision, basic need, basic needs,\n            beneficiaries, Beneficiary assessments, beneficiary\n            participation, Borrower, businesses, Capacity Building,\n            capital formation, CAS, child care, cities, commercial\n            activity, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, community groups, community\n            involvement, community participation, corruption,\n            counterpart funds, data collection methods,\n            decentralization, discrimination, districts,\n            diversification, earnings, economic growth, economic\n            opportunities, economic success, economic successes,\n            educational attainment, electricity, eligibility criteria,\n            eligible children, empowerment, enabling environment,\n            enrollment, enrolment rate, ethnic groups, Exchange Rate,\n            expenditure, external auditors, externalities, extreme\n            poverty, facilitation, families, family income, farm income,\n            female, Financial Analysis, Financial Management, financial\n            support, financial viability, first loan, fraud, Gender,\n            Gender Aspects, good governance, households, Housing, human\n            capital, ICR, ID, Impact Assessment, impact evaluation,\n            Implementation Completion Report, implementation stages,\n            Implementing Agencies, Implementing agency, indigenous\n            peoples, inequality, Information System, inhabitants,\n            innovations, installment, institution, Institutional\n            Capacity, Institutional Development, institutional reforms,\n            international consultant, intervention, interventions, IP,\n            Key performance indicators, labor markets, learning, legal\n            framework, legal requirements, Lending Portfolio,\n            livelihoods, LOAN, local government, local governments,\n            M&amp;E arrangements, M&amp;E design, marketing,\n            migration, Monitoring &amp;

The additional financing\n            will support the following three components: (a) Community\n            development sub-projects. Grants for small-scale\n            demand-driven sub-projects prepared and submitted by groups\n            of eligible beneficiaries. sub- projects will include income\n            generating sub-project,  as well as community development\n            sub-projects for activities that will complement productive\n            investments. (b) Capacity-building and institutional\n            development. Strengthen local community's capacity to\n            design, implement and monitor community development\n            activities and to facilitate their participation in overall\n            project implementation. This component will support\n            services, training and organizational development, and the\n            implementation of a participatory monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) system. (c) Project management, monitoring and\n            evaluation. Support the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to\n            coordinate the technical and administrative aspects, oversee\n            implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Project,\n            and to carry out specialized studies. These studies will\n            include at least the following: (i) social and economic\n            inclusion; (ii) base line studies; (iii) additional sector\n            specific studies. The main change is an expansion of the\n            scope of the Project, as part of the process of scaling up\n            the poverty impacts, to include an additional five\n            Departments - Caaguazu, Central, Cordillera, Guaira and\n            Paraguari. The additional Departments will expand the\n            project's reach to about 60 percent of the\n            country's overall population, and expand his target\n            population of the project close to 60 percent of the\n            country's population living in extreme poverty (up from\n            the approximately 15 percent of the country's\n            population in extreme poverty targeted under the Ongoing\n            Project). The Mid-Term Evaluation as well as recent social\n            monitoring reviews indicated that the sub-projects funded\n            during the ongoing Project increased beneficiary incomes.\n            Existing data from a recent impact evaluation show\n            substantial changes in outcome variables for participants.\n            There has been a significant improvement in economic\n            variables of participants, compared to non-participants,\n            particularly regarding (i) wellbeing, (ii) employment, and\n            (iii) asset ownership. Other benefits include better\n            participation in schooling, more confidence in community and\n            stronger measures of social capital."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Pilot

Paraguay. The project will contribute to the development of\n            the capacity of local communities to implement poverty\n            alleviation and community development activities. There are\n            two main project components. The first component finances\n            small-scale, demand-driven subprojects prepared and\n            submitted by groups of eligible beneficiaries. Income\n            generation subprojects will include projects aiming at\n            agricultural diversification (e.g., raising pigs, chickens,\n            flowers, etc.), and will include small enterprises, artisan\n            workshops, eco-tourism, services such as laundries,\n            processing facilities, community markets, and the like, as\n            well as community development subprojects for activities\n            complementing productive investments such as child care\n            facilities, community centers, and child/youth development,\n            among others. This component also finances technical\n            assistance for subproject identification, preparation, and\n            implementation. The second component strengthens the\n            capacity of local communities to design and implement\n            community development activities and facilitates their\n            participation
