Some lessons learned\n            included: (i) strong borrower commitment; (ii) comprehensive\n            planning for engineering, equipment supply, installation,\n            and commissioning; and (iii) close field supervision by a\n            competent owner that identified and rectified problems in a\n            timely manner are key factors for a complex project such as\n            this one. This project and other recently completed power\n            projects in China show that construction management was\n            successfully performed by the implementing agencies. Also,\n            the project was explicitly designed to pilot new approaches\n            to meet environmental requirements at minimum cost,\n            restructuring the power sector, and utilizing private sector\n            finance. Piloting has been the feature characteristic of\n            Chinese reforms. Finally, several positive, systemic lessons\n            for Bank supervision were identified in the QAG review: (a)\n            an experienced, knowledgeable, and cohesive team is\n            beneficial to project implementation; (b) continuity is\n            important in ensuring effective supervision and establishing\n            good rapport with counterparts; and (c) supervision of\n            multiple projects in the same country or sector by the same\n            team is cost-effective."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Waigaoquio Thermal Power

          Shanghai Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Project was judged to be\n            highly satisfactory: overall and provided an example of very\n            good supervision practice. The quality of supervision\n            throughout this final period of project implementation i.e.\n            the seventh and eighth years since Board approval, was\n            pragmatic, well-focused and solutions-oriented. Almost all\n            the main development objectives have now been\n            achieved-namely, the commissioning of two large, coal-fired\n            thermal plants-despite an extensive delay at start up; the\n            adoption of the \"bubble concept\" approach to\n            controlling atmospheric pollution for the first time in the\n            developing world, despite initial skepticism by the company\n            and some local authorities; a reform program for the power\n            company that went beyond that envisaged at appraisal; and\n            the successful mobilization of financing for the power\n            sector from international markets. Several positive,\n            systemic lessons for Bank supervision more generally emerge\n            from this review. First, the project benefited from an\n            experienced supervision team that knew the power sector in\n            China very well. Second, continuity in Bank staff working on\n            a project is important in ensuring good supervision. The\n            supervision team was also cohesive; all the members had a\n            deep institutional knowledge of the power sector in China\n            and have been working as a team on other projects. The\n            supervision results demonstrate the team's high\n            professionalism and the good rapport and working\n            relationship established with their project counterparts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Waigaogiao Thermal Power Project :\n            seventh quality of supervision assessment (QSA7) - summary\n            assessment

- Waigaoqiao Phase II Power Plant\n            Project : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"To meet power demands, the second phase\n            of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant Project will increase\n            generating capacity by constructing two coal-fired\n            supercritical units. A third and final phrase of installing\n            additional capacity will follow. This environmental\n            assessment was prepared to supplement an earlier draft\n            report submitted by the East China Electric Power Design\n            Institute (ECEPDI) to further address the impacts of the\n            project, particularly as they relate to current and future\n            power production at the Waigaoqiao facility. Mitigation of\n            air pollution takes the form of emissions controls and\n            emissions offsets. A high-efficiency electrostatic\n            precipitator (ESP) will be installed to reduce particle\n            emissions from the plant to acceptable levels. Particle\n            emissions from coal and ash handling and storage activities\n            will be controlled by using covered conveyors, watering, and\n            air pollution control equipment. The dust control program\n            from Phase I will continue to minimize emissions from\n            general traffic. Bottom ash will be slurried with recycled\n            water eliminating dusting conditions. Fly ash disposed of in\n            an ash yard will be humidified, reducing the potential for\n            fugitive particulate emissions. Sulphur dioxide emissions\n            will be mitigated by using low-sulphur coal. Emissions of\n            nitrogen oxides will be mitigated by using low-nitrogen\n            oxide- derivative burners, a technology incorporated into\n            modern boiler designs. Mitigation of negative impacts on\n            water resources includes: wastewater treatment using\n            neutralization and sedimentation; oil-separation employed\n            for water with the potential for oil contamination; cooling\n            water treated with chlorine for biological control to\n            minimize chlorine residue; treated wastewater will be\n            discharged with cooling water at predetermined dilution\n            percentages; other low volume wastewaters such as\n            oil-contaminated water, boiling cleaning wastewater, and\n            bottom ash sluice water will be recycled after treatment;\n            rainwater in the ash yards will be diverted to the settling\n            basins at sufficient capacity to obviate the need for\n            discharge; and non-contact rainfall runoff will go to\n            settling ponds for discharge. Ash disposal will be mitigated\n            by its reuse. Impacts associated with resettlement will be\n            mitigated according to World Bank operational directives and\n            the country s relevant laws and regulations, and possibly\n            include job replacement and/or compensation. Finally, the\n            comprehensive monitoring program for Phase I, which measures\n            the air, water, ash, and occupational conditions, will\n            continue in Phase II during both construction and\n            operational periods. Specifically, during construction,\n            environmental monitoring of dust emissions, runoff, and\n            solid wastes will be performed. Any construction discharge\n            will be monitored for pH, total suspended solids, and other\n            parameters. Noise; emissions and ambient air quality; the\n            quality of raw water, service water, and wastewater\n            discharged to the environment; and periodic safety training\n            and the use of primary personnel protection measures will be monitored."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Waigaoqiao Phase II Power Plant\n            Project : environmental

shortages in Shanghai through development of two\n            very large coal-fired super-critical thermal units; 2)\n            develop a program to apply for the first time in China the\n            \"bubble concept\" for cost effective air quality\n            management within Shanghai Municipality; 3) support the\n            ongoing power sector reform by restructuring Shanghai\n            Municipal Electric Power Company (SMEPC) in line with the\n            power sector reform strategy; increasing private sector\n            involvement through listing of the generation company; and\n            adjusting the tariff level to accommodate the stricter\n            sulfur dioxide emission standards; and 4) promote an\n            innovative and diversified financing model for large\n            infrastructure projects and improve the access of power\n            entities to international financial markets.  The project\n            will include the following components: (i) investment; (ii)\n            environmental protection; (iii) power sector reform; and\n            (iv) institutional
