The experience\n            of these two operations convey the following. Projects\n            implemented in countries with an ongoing conflict, should be\n            continually monitored to identify, and assess the conflict\n            risk to the projects. First, under continuing high risk\n            conditions, thus project implementation likely to prove\n            counterproductive, by exposing the Bank and Borrower to\n            compensation and other claims, the Bank might consider\n            disengagement until the environment improves. Second, upon\n            resuming project implementation following a substantial\n            period of inactivity due to conflict, technical and\n            financial audits should be carried out to reassess\n            priorities for action, as well as, and any remedial measures\n            needed to secure completed activities. Third, when a country\n            is in, or emerging from conflict, the Bank may need to adopt\n            a more flexible approach to borrower compliance with\n            reform-related loan covenants. A realistic timeframe should\n            be agreed when attempting to introduce unpopular reforms in\n            the context of violence, and social instability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone -

Lessons learned are addressed as\n            follows. First, lessons for project preparation indicate\n            that although the project was not featured in the Country\n            Assistance Strategy (needing additional funding allocation\n            from the International Development Association (IDA) because\n            of the civil conflict, it was nonetheless successfully\n            implemented given its relief type lending, where assistance\n            from Bank staff, provided strong inputs, even in the absence\n            of a sector development strategy. However, a project such as\n            this one, designed as a quick relief operation, should\n            include sufficient activities for the physical outputs, and\n            address capacity issues to ensure sustainability;\n            additionally, arrangements for the road fund should have\n            been made under the project, with assistance to be\n            undertaken from the private sector. Second, as for project\n            implementation, recommendations suggest that sound\n            accounting, and financial management systems should have\n            been included, to avoid irreconcilable difficulties of\n            project accounts. Third, as per a post conflict assistance,\n            it is paramount to count on political stability, or to be\n            able to minimize claims due to force majeure, the absence of\n            which delayed the resumption of some project activities,\n            which are still unsettled."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Freetown Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation
