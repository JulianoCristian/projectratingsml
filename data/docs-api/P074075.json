With\n            Egypt's graduation from the international Development\n            Association (IDA) in 1999, the Government had begun to\n            closely evaluate the financial implications of new IBRD\n            borrowings for projects that could be otherwise financed\n            from grant resources. As this was a new issue at the time\n            for the Bank and the Government was making determination in\n            this regard on a case-by-case basis at the time, the\n            decision on Matruh II was clarified only after IBRD Board\n            approval. The major lesson learned: During the period of\n            extended transition that follows graduation from IDA (and\n            the implementation of the remaining IDA portfolio) and the\n            commencement of IBRD borrowing, the Bank and the Government\n            should jointly reconfirm the lending pipeline to ensure that\n            projects continue to remain a priority on the new financing terms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Second Matruh Resource Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Second Matruh Resource\n            Management

To reduce the potential impacts\n            related to the range rehabilitation activities, the location\n            will be planned and a connectivity between the areas for\n            habitat will be maintained.
