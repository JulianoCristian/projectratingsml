Some objectives were\n            either not achieved or only partially achieved, such as\n            strengthening the capacity of the district technical staff\n            to assist producers, training of the remaining personnel,\n            contributing to the transfer of knowledge to and building\n            the capacity of the farmers' groups and organizations,\n            and helping redundant personnel to find new employment.\n            Project sustainability is unlikely, and both performances of\n            the Bank and the Borrower are rated overall unsatisfactory.\n            the overall outcome of the Community-Based Food Security\n            Project (PILSA) is rated satisfactory, with sustainability\n            rated likely. Bank performance and that of the Borrower are\n            rated overall satisfactory. Lastly, the assessment rates the\n            overall outcome of the Second Rural Savings and Loans\n            Cooperatives Rehabilitation (Rural Credit II) as\n            unsatisfactory; the project was undermined by the severe\n            problems with the Federation of Rural Savings and Loans\n            Cooperatives, including insufficient training at the local\n            level, defaulted loans owing to the lack of due diligence,\n            and inadequate records on repayment schedules, among other\n            problems. sustainability is unlikely Both the Bank and the\n            Borrower's performances are rated unsatisfactory.\n            Experience with this project confirms a number of OED\n            lessons: 1) A feasible plan (both functional and financial)\n            that can be fully implemented is essential when changing the\n            institutiona structure of a major government organization\n            such as the Ministry of Agriculture. The plan must be\n            flexible and capable of being changed as it is being\n            implemented, and periodically monitored so that management\n            can learn what is working and what parts need to be altered\n            during the implementation phase. 2) A decentralized and\n            demand-driven system is a viable approach to the successful\n            delivery of food security and nurition programs. The PILSA\n            project was successful because each community was able to\n            tailor the specific program delivery to its own needs, and\n            because of the expertise of both international and local\n            nongovernmental organizations to implement micro-projects\n            and deliver the nutrition programs. Local NGOs were able to\n            identify with local populations. This occurred as a result\n            of the decentralized implementation of PILSA coupled with\n            the strong leadership of the implementing agencies and their\n            firm commitment to the success of the project. 3) The\n            sustainable provision of rural credit requires appropriate\n            institutional development and training. If a good monitoring\n            and evaluation system had been present in the FECECAM\n            network and more attention given to appropriate training,\n            FECECAM would not be facing such an acute problem with arrears."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin -

The lessons strongly\n            emphasize that, when streamlining institutions, project\n            design should explicitly identify the staff whose expertise\n            will no longer be required, and in turn, include incentives\n            to retain staff with desirable skills. In addition, project\n            design should have also ensured financing arrangements upon\n            the transfer of an autonomous entity, operating on\n            semi-commercial terms, into a budget-supported entity, for\n            instead of allowing full concentration to extension\n            services, such entity also carried the burden of generating\n            their own funds, further increasing their bureaucracy, and\n            dependency on central ministerial services. The concept of\n            \"polyvalence of extension agents\" proved\n            inefficient, and costly, and the quality of service to\n            producers was not improved. However, empowering farmers, and\n            communities with responsibilities, including financial\n            resources management, and appropriate training, contributed\n            to successful partnerships in development, effectively\n            negotiating with the Government, and donors.
