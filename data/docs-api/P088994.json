Some lessons learned included: a\n            well-structured consultative process involving all\n            stakeholders, particularly the beneficiaries, should precede\n            project preparation. A communication strategy should be\n            developed to keep constant liaison with all stakeholders for\n            projects of this nature. This will minimize complaints that\n            come forth during project implementation. The borrower\n            should be adequately informed at all levels that the\n            Bank's procedures need to be followed for all\n            procurements.

Rehabilitation and Modernization Project\n            are to take urgent steps to prevent the failure of the\n            Taunsa Barrage, which provides irrigation for two million\n            acres, in addition to drinking water to several million\n            farmers in the rural areas of Southern Punjab; and to\n            prepare for similar steps with respect to other existing\n            barrages in Punjab. In view of potential environmental\n            adversity during construction works, this environmental\n            impact assessment provides mitigation measures in compliance\n            with the Bank's operational directives on the\n            environment, the project having been classified as category\n            B. This category is justified, since environmental impacts\n            will be localized over immediate project areas and\n            agricultural lands will be avoided at the construction\n            stage. Contractors shall comply with specific contract\n            requirements and with the social framework agreement\n            precautionary clauses. In addition, retrogression downstream\n            and pulsating hydraulic jumps shall be in compliance with\n            technically sound and economical designs of the secondary\n            weir, as will all other aspects of construction, and/or\n            engineering design. Construction wastes will be disposed of\n            at selected sites, and is the responsibility of the\n            contractor as defined in relevant contracts. Soil erosion\n            will be controlled, and the terrain should stabilize\n            accordingly. Oil spills, lubricants, and hazardous materials\n            will be stored in covered tanks, to be disposed of per\n            standard international regulations. Drainage systems will be\n            regularly inspected to avoid any possible sedimentation or\n            obstruction. Embankments or concrete walls will be installed\n            around the construction perimeter to secure construction\n            sites. Regular discharges and water flows will be regularly\n            controlled to avoid potential surface and water\n            contamination, while construction surfaces, and materials\n            should be covered to avoid air pollution. To mitigate noise\n            disturbances, working schedules will be limited to daytime\n            working hours. Inspections will be conducted by wildlife,\n            forest, and fisheries officials to ensure environmental\n            protection of sites or enforce legislation as needed.

Project for\n            Pakistan are: (a) to take urgent steps to prevent the\n            failure of the Taunsa Barrage which provides irrigation for\n            two million acres and drinking water to several million\n            farmers in the rural areas of Southern Punjab; and (b) to\n            prepare for similar steps with respect to other existing\n            barrages in Punjab. The objectives will be achieved through:\n            (i) rehabilitating and strengthening the Taunsa Barrage and\n            associated structures; (ii) renovation and modernization of\n            gates, hoists and operating and control facilities; (iii)\n            improving operation and maintenance capability; and (iv)\n            rehabilitation design studies for other barrages in Punjab.\n            The major benefits of the Project stem from securing\n            irrigation of the cultivated lands in the command areas of\n            over two million acres in the two canal commands of\n            Muzaffargarh and Dera Ghazi Khan, and through the\n            Taunsa-Panjnad Link Canal to supplement water supply to\n            Panjnad Headworks canals. Other benefits from the\n            rehabilitation of the barrage include: (a) long-term and\n            effective functioning of the critical oil and gas pipelines,\n            and telephone lines; and (b) ensuring continued availability\n            of vital rail and road links of strategic importance between\n            the Punjab and the Sindh and Balochistan provinces."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Taunsa Barrage Emergency\n            Rehabilitation and Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Taunsa Barrage\n            Emergency Rehabilitation and Modernization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/02/5627753/pakistan-taunsa-barrage-emergency-rehabilitation-modernization-project","projn":"PK-Taunsa Barrages Emergency Rehabilitation\n            And Modernization Proj -- P088994","docty":"Technical Annex","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Water Supply and Systems,Engineering,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050228093536"},"subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Irrigation and drainage,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"afflux, aging, Agriculture, annual flow,\n            annual rainfall, Barrages, Basin, bunds, canals, cofferdam,\n            construction, covers, crop yields, crops, crossings,\n            cultivated lands, Dam Safety, Dams, disasters, drinking\n            water, dry season, Embankments, Employment, Engineering,\n            engineering design, engines, Environmental Impact\n            Assessment, Environmental Management, environmental\n            monitoring, Environmental Protection, erosion, families,\n            farmers, Floods, flow measurement, gas, hoists, hydraulic\n            jump, hydrology, International Waterways, intervention,\n            inundation, Irrigation, irrigation canals, irrigation\n            systems, irrigation water, joints, ladders, Lessons Learned,\n            measurements, natural disasters, Operation &\n            Maintenance, partnership, pipe, pipelines, pressure,\n            programs, PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, Project Management,\n            project preparation, protective aprons, quality assurance,\n            rainfall, REHABILITATION, riparian, River, River System,\n            rivers, safe water, Safety, safety management, sand,\n            sediment, sediment deposition, sediments, seepage, Silt,\n            standing wave, structures, sustainable use, tributaries,\n            velocity, water flows, water level, water levels, water\n            management, water supply, water use, Waters, weirs, winter\n            crops, winter wheat"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"T7642"},"6103096":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/09/6103096/pakistan-taunsa-barrage-rehabilitation-modernization-project-environmental-assessment-vol-1-2","available_in":"English,English","fullavailablein":[{"lang":"English","entityid":"000160016_20060607154830","node_id":"6103096"}],"url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/09/6103096/pakistan-taunsa-barrage-rehabilitation-modernization-project-environmental-assessment-vol-1-2","new_url":"2004/09/6103096/pakistan-taunsa-barrage-rehabilitation-modernization-project-environmental-assessment-vol-1-2","disclosure_date":"2005-07-27T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/07/27/000012009_20050727143640/Rendered/INDEX/E1031.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/07/27/000012009_20050727143640/Rendered/PDF/E1031.pdf","loan_no":"7277","datestored":"2005-07-27T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Taunsa Barrage Rehabilitation\n            and Modernization Project : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The main objectives of the Taunsa\n            Barrage Emergency Rehabilitation and Modernization Project\n            are to take urgent steps to prevent the failure of the\n            Taunsa Barrage, which provides irrigation for two million\n            acres, in addition to drinking water to several million\n            farmers in the rural areas of Southern Punjab; and to\n            prepare for similar steps with respect to other existing\n            barrages in Punjab. In view of potential environmental\n            adversity during construction works, this environmental\n            impact assessment provides mitigation measures in compliance\n            with the Bank's operational directives on the\n            environment, the project having been classified as category\n            B. This category is justified, since environmental impacts\n            will be localized over immediate project areas and\n            agricultural lands will be avoided at the construction\n            stage. Contractors shall comply with specific contract\n            requirements and with the social framework agreement\n            precautionary clauses. In addition, retrogression downstream\n            and pulsating hydraulic jumps shall be in compliance with\n            technically sound and economical designs of the secondary\n            weir, as will all other aspects of construction, and/or\n            engineering design. Construction wastes will be disposed of\n            at selected sites, and is the responsibility of the\n            contractor as defined in relevant contracts. Soil erosion\n            will be controlled, and the terrain should stabilize\n            accordingly. Oil spills, lubricants, and hazardous materials\n            will be stored in covered tanks, to be disposed of per\n            standard international regulations. Drainage systems will be\n            regularly inspected to avoid any possible sedimentation or\n            obstruction. Embankments or concrete walls will be installed\n            around the construction perimeter to secure construction\n            sites. Regular discharges and water flows will be regularly\n            controlled to avoid potential surface and water\n            contamination, while construction surfaces, and materials\n            should be covered to avoid air pollution. To mitigate noise\n            disturbances, working schedules will be limited to daytime\n            working hours. Inspections will be conducted by wildlife,\n            forest, and fisheries officials to ensure environmental\n            protection of sites or enforce legislation as needed. The\n            report also addresses social issues, including tribal\n            issues, particularly on the uses of canals and aquatic life."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Taunsa Barrage Rehabilitation and\n            Modernization Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Taunsa Barrage\n            Rehabilitation and Modernization Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/09/6103096/pakistan-taunsa-barrage-rehabilitation-modernization-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"PK-Taunsa Barrages Emergency Rehabilitation\n            And Modernization Proj -- P088994","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Pakistan","authors":{"authr":"Punjab Barrages Consultants"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050727143640"},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","lang":"English","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Civil works;
