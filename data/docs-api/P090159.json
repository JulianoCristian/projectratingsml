Some lessons learned included:\n            the baseline and outcome indicators of this project were not\n            well defined. While the results framework suggests there\n            were no committees at appraisal, the technical annex\n            mentions that about 50 committees existed in one form or\n            another in the 133 communes. Interviews with the local\n            committees confirm that in some cases there was already a\n            committee in place, although a solid structure was still\n            lacking. The objectives, indicators and outcomes of this\n            project made the quantitative measurement of the impact\n            complicated. Similar projects will benefit from a\n            well-prepared results framework with realistic and\n            measurable indicators. It has been observed that the\n            committees which include members from civil society are the\n            highest performing and most dynamic committees. Moreover,\n            strong leadership by municipal governments has proved to be\n            even more essential. In the communes where the mayor feels a\n            strong sense of ownership of the committee, committees have\n            been engaged in a higher number and wider variety of\n            activities. Over time, these projects have also been able to\n            actively engage with other development actors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Emergency Recovery and Disaster\n            Management

of Haiti are 1): to assist\n            in the rehabilitation of the areas affected by the recent\n            adverse natural events. Satisfactory planning and completion\n            of a rehabilitation scheme for affected settlements are key\n            outcome indicators; 2) to strengthen the country's\n            capacity to manage natural disaster risks and better respond\n            to emergencies resulting from adverse natural events. The\n            key outcomes for the capacity established within the DPC\n            includes: (i) a validated legal framework;(ii) stronger\n            management systems; (iii) improved technical capacity; and\n            (iv) an operational, validated National Response Plan; 3) to\n            reduce the vulnerability of communities through risk\n            identification and mapping, and risk mitigation activities\n            at the local level.. The potential negative environmental\n            impacts overall under the Project can be: a) The survival\n            strategies and the environment in rural Haiti are often\n            complex, unpredictable and fragile; b) Some alternative\n            lifestyles and better marketing of agricultural products\n            (including livestock), resulting in improved well-being,\n            could lead to greater demand on natural resources or\n            environmental degradation; c) The introduction of investment\n            in targeted areas may attract immigrants which would\n            increase the pressure on existing resources and could lead\n            to conflicts within the population; d) The introduction of\n            alien plant species could affect the evolution of the\n            biodiversity of the country; e) Deterioration of the\n            landscape or movement of land through drainage works, soil\n            conservation and road; and f) The procurement of materials\n            for construction projects may affect the state of natural\n            resources in certain areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Manuel des operations de

           rehabilitation of the areas affected by the recent adverse\n            natural disasters; (b) to strengthen the country's\n            capacity to manage natural disaster risks and better respond\n            to emergencies resulting from adverse natural events; and\n            (c) to reduce the vulnerability of communities through risk\n            identification and risk mitigation activities. These\n            objectives are consistent with one of the focal points of\n            the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) that outlines\n            IDA'S strategy for Haiti over the next 24 months (FY05\n            and FY06). The TSS explicitly incorporates the activities\n            already submitted to the LICUS Trust Fund, including the\n            proposed disaster reconstruction and mitigation initiatives.\n            The TSS, being presented to the Board together with this\n            proposed operation, also includes in the lending program the\n            proposed Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project\n            for US$12 million equivalent. The objectives are also\n            consistent with the overall priorities on environmental\n            management within the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF).\n            The longer term objectives of the Environment Thematic\n            Group, in which IDA is an active participant, include the\n            development of sustainable strategies to reverse resource\n            degradation by introducing sustainable watershed management,\n            reforestation and measures to reduce the impact of climatic hazards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Emergency Recovery and Disaster\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Haiti - Emergency Recovery and\n            Disaster Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5508101/haiti-emergency-recovery-disaster-management-project","projn":"HT-Emergency Recovery And Disaster\n            Management -- P090159","docty":"Technical Annex","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Hazard Risk Management,Public Sector Economics,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Haiti","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20041217100000"},"subsc":"General public administration sector,Sewerage,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, accounting, auditing,\n            auditors, autonomy, clinics, community participation,\n            decision makers, disasters, early warning systems,\n            emergencies, employment, Environmental Assessment,\n            environmental degradation, environmental impacts,\n            environmental management, executives, exercises, families,\n            FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, financial transactions, FISCAL YEAR,\n            floods, Hazards, institutional development, intervention,\n            inventory, land use, leadership, legal framework, Local\n            Government, Management Capacity, Management training, media,\n            natural disasters, Natural Resources, Operating Expenses,\n            population density, Private Sector, PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION,\n            project management, project preparation, Public Health,\n            reforestation, rehabilitation, resource management, risk\n            management, risk mitigation, rivers, Rural Development,\n            schools, Social Development, social issues, social support,\n            supervision, taxation, teams, technical assistance,\n            Transport, Trust Funds, urban areas"}},"owner":"Urban (LCSUW)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"repnb":"T7640"},"facets":{}}}
