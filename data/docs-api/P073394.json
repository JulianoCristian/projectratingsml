Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            include the following: in the future, the use of learning\n            instrument loans (LILs) or any instrument that circumvents\n            any of the usual safeguard investigation during preparation\n            should be subject not only to the normal tests of\n            eligibility, but also the test o f downside risks, be these\n            technical or the likelihood of adverse public opinion; where\n            the client is not familiar with Bank operations and\n            procedures or is confronting serious impediments to its\n            ability to act on that knowledge, continuous presence of\n            competent Bank representatives is a critical factor in\n            moving dialogue and operations forward; when ambiguity or\n            disagreements arise in implementation, particularly with the\n            evolving focus or importance of an activity, an agreed\n            strategy can become an effective management tool;\n            institutions generally respond more favorably to moderate or\n            gradual change than to radical innovation, particularly when\n            power or stature are being threatened; and finally, while\n            fiduciary accountability requires correct procedures and\n            oversight, the development impact o f the Bank's\n            approach to the issue is very much linked to the sensitivity\n            with which it introduces the qualities of transparency and\n            cost-effectiveness as desirable qualities in procurement transactions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Agricultural Productivity\n            Improvement ;

Factors\n            affecting the project included worse than expected\n            conditions, while climatic conditions, the presence of land\n            mines in some sections of the roads, and other international\n            political events also affected the pace of project\n            implementation. Factors subject to government control\n            included coordination issues, early insufficient commitment\n            and senior-level attention, and approval delays.  Factors\n            subject to implementing agency control included: lack of\n            coordination and collaboration, administrative delays in\n            decision making, delays in the hiring of consultants, and\n            under-estimating the cost for rehabilitating individual\n            sub-projects.  The following lessons were learned: (a) Civil\n            works restoration projects require adequate programs for\n            capacity building in the implementing agencies; (b) The\n            project was hampered by the lack of a list of sub-projects\n            identified through field visits; (c) Availability of\n            agricultural extension services is crucial to both poverty\n            alleviation and sustainable operation and maintenance for\n            irrigation facilities rehabilitated under the project; (d)\n            The early planning was insufficient to ensure project\n            sustainability;  (e) Community contracting under the schools\n            component with a participatory approach has been proved to\n            be the most efficient means of procurement for large numbers\n            of schools to be constructed simultaneously over\n            geographically dispersed areas; (f) Generally, more time\n            should be spent estimating project costs; (g) Even an\n            emergency project benefits from an explicit, well-prepared\n            logical framework."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Flood Emergency
