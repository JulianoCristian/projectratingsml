The outcomes of the Innovations in Basic\n            Education and Northeast Basic Education (NEBE) projects are\n            rated moderately satisfactory. The projects exceeded or\n            surpassed most targets for physical inputs and training but\n            it is not clear that the learning goals were met. The\n            objectives of the two NEBE projects were focused towards\n            central management improvements, and these had little or no\n            impact on quality improvement. Due to design shortcomings,\n            Bank performance for the FUNDESCOLA project, which was\n            designed to target schools, was satisfactory. Borrower\n            performance is rated satisfactory for all but the\n            Innovations in Education project. A number of OED lessons\n            are confirmed with these projects: 1) Attention should be\n            paid to state, municipal, or even school management, and\n            moreover, to classromm time. States and municipalities that\n            are better off are more likely to take advantage of\n            Bank-financed resources. The challenge is to emcourage the\n            poorer ones to benefit as well. Decentralizing school\n            managmeent is not a panacea: autonomy permits the poorest or\n            least knowledgeable municipalities to fall behind, without\n            much possibility for helping the residents. Classroom\n            observations may be used as predictors of achievement: they\n            can potentially provide feedback and promote improvements\n            sooner than achievement tests. Students' health needs\n            and problems must be addressed to optimize cognitive\n            development and classroom learning."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Innovations in Basic Education\n

At\n            the state level, the project will:  (a) streamline state\n            education bureaucracies and help them achieve more efficient\n            use of human resources and a more efficient allocation of\n            spending; (b) increase state and municipal materials; (c)\n            improve state and municipal teachers' skills and\n            classroom effectiveness and the leadership skills of school\n            directors; (d) finance a time slice of the states'\n            school rehabilitation and construction programs, conditional\n            upon states' progress in implementing agreed management\n            reforms; and (e) support promising state and municipal\n            education initiatives through matching grants from a small\n            innovations fund.
