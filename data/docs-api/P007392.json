Lessons are addressed as\n            follows. The model established by the Family Assistance\n            Program (PRAF) under the project, aims at protecting the\n            most vulnerable groups, from potentially, negative impacts\n            of economic structural adjustment, and from the effects of\n            absolute poverty. It provides financial incentives to poor\n            families, including significant impact on improving the\n            nutrition, health and education conditions of the family. As\n            such, experience shows that demand-side interventions need\n            to be accompanied by provision of effective social\n            protection, to ensure coverage for demand incentives. In\n            addition, the appropriately structured community\n            participation, contributed to sustainability, based on four\n            key successful elements in water and sanitation: training\n            and community participation; community involvement in the\n            provision of spare parts and supplies; use of appropriate\n            technology; and, nomination of promoters within the\n            councils, able to ensure information dissemination on health\n            matters, and motivated to sustain the system. However, links\n            between nutrition and education should be reinforced;\n            strategic attention to infrastructure activities could\n            further improve outcomes; and, improved communications could\n            reduce delays, particularly as experienced during\n            implementation regarding disbursement requests, and\n            replenishment of the Special
