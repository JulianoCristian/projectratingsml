Some\n            lessons learned included: the importance of strong national\n            ownership of the operation is fundamental to the success of\n            a Development Policy Loan (DPL) program. Coalitions of\n            political support for a DPL program must be carefully\n            assessed before undertaking ambitious reforms. Both\n            political feasibility and depth of reform must be taken into\n            account for the DPL series to be successful. From a\n            technical standpoint, reforms that strengthen small\n            'concentrated' teams with important leverage\n            provide opportunities for large pay-offs. Sustained\n            engagement on the part of the Bank is critical to\n            effectively support reform processes over the medium and\n            long term. Combining technical assistance and DPLs generate\n            mutual leverage for achieving development objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Primer Prestamo Programatico para\n

execution, as a contribution of\n            the anti-crisis plan; and b) paving the way for the reform\n            process in the areas supported by the loan.

Building on the dialogue developed with\n            the Government, the Bank intends to contribute through this\n            operation to the Government plan's overall objective of\n            achieving sustainable and more equitable growth by providing\n            direct support to three of its pillars: 1) macroeconomic\n            policy; 2) state-owned enterprises; and 3) state\n            modernization. The Bank operation will also be included in\n            the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) contingency\n            package totaling US$300 million, which is one of the\n            components of the anti-crisis plan aiming at creating fiscal\n            space to soften the impact of the crisis through an increase\n            in public investment and prioritized social expenditures.\n            The operation will focus on four program components: 1) tax\n            system; 2) public sector financial control; 3) expenditure\n            management; and 4) human
