The equipment will be sold by private\n            equipment dealers under the Government of Bangladesh's\n            liberalized/deregulated policy framework for private\n            sector-led minor irrigation development.  By providing a\n            foreign exchange facility to allow private sector dealers to\n            import small engines for shallow tubewells and low lift\n            pumps, as well as power tillers, for sale to farmers, the\n            project is expected to provide:  (a) irrigation for about\n            340,000 ha of land using an estimated 75,000 shallow\n            tubewells (STW); (b) irrigation for approximately 120,000 ha\n            of land using some 6,000 low lift pumps (LLP); and (c)\n            improved tillage for around 460,000 ha of land using about\n            18,000 power tillers.  These numbers are indicative, since\n            the actual types and quantities of equipment installed will\n            depend on demand from farmers.
