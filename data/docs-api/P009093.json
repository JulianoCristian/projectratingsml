Both the Bank and the Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily.  The project generally accomplished more\n            than what had been planned in terms of physical quantities\n            with the exception of the water supply component.. Lessons\n            learned included the following: (a) The risk analysis and\n            allocation of private operator contracts in the water supply\n            and sanitation sector must be improved. (b) Projects must be\n            affordable - this project was too big, leading to financial\n            difficulties, and it would have been better implemented in\n            stages. (c) Projects should have limited objectives -  the\n            five objectives made implementation difficult.  (d)\n            Selection criteria in private sector participation must be\n            carefully analyzed. (e) Local utilities may be unable to\n            bear the exchange rate risk where there is a high risk of\n            devaluation and where the revenue is in local currency but\n            debt

     the demand for water supply, sewerage and stormwater\n            drainage; b) develop new institutional arrangements for\n            management of municipal water supply, sewerage and\n            stormwater drainage, and to introduce private sector\n            participation in the operation of the services; c) implement\n            appropriate cost recovery policies; d) postpone the need to\n            develop costly new water resources by improving the\n            efficiency of utilization of existing sources and of water\n            usage by reducing the volume of non-revenue water which is\n            presently too high; and e) improve and sustain environmental\n            conditions and reduce health hazards that threaten the local\n            population and the tourism industry. The project represents\n            the first phase, to be implemented from 1995 throug 2002, of\n            a program designed to continue to the year 2020. The project\n            will: a) renovate, rehabilitate and extend the existing\n            water supply network; b) provide a new sewerage network and\n            a preliminary wastewater treatment plant on the western part\n            of the municipality; c) improve operation of septic tanks in\n            the eastern part of the city; d) upgrade the stormwater\n            drainage system in flood areas and elaborate a comprehensive\n            master plan; and e) provide technical assistance for project\n            implementation and institutional

     the demand for water supply, sewerage and stormwater\n            drainage; b) develop new institutional arrangements for\n            management of municipal water supply, sewerage and\n            stormwater drainage, and to introduce private sector\n            participation in the operation of the services; c) implement\n            appropriate cost recovery policies; d) postpone the need to\n            develop costly new water resources by improving the\n            efficiency of utilization of existing sources and of water\n            usage by reducing the volume of non-revenue water which is\n            presently too high; and e) improve and sustain environmental\n            conditions and reduce health hazards that threaten the local\n            population and the tourism industry. The project represents\n            the first phase, to be implemented from 1995 throug 2002, of\n            a program designed to continue to the year 2020. The project\n            will: a) renovate, rehabilitate and extend the existing\n            water supply network; b) provide a new sewerage network and\n            a preliminary wastewater treatment plant on the western part\n            of the municipality; c) improve operation of septic tanks in\n            the eastern part of the city; d) upgrade the stormwater\n            drainage system in flood areas and elaborate a comprehensive\n            master plan; and e) provide technical assistance for project\n            implementation and institutional development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
