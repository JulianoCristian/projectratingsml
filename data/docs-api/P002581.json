The project,\n            situated on both sides of the Blue Nile river from about 30\n            kms upstream of Singa to Sennar, will cover 52,500 feddans\n            and about 50,000 feddans respectively inside and outside the\n            Shasheina Region. The project will improve levels of\n            productivity, particularly for cotton (in both regions),\n            sorghum, groundnuts and vegetables, and introduce fodder\n            crop for livestock (in Shasheina only). As a result, cotton\n            exports will be increased, incomes for the BNAC and the\n            tenants will rise and the schemes will once again be placed\n            on a sound management and financial footing. This will be\n            achieved through provision of: (i) agricultural machinery,\n            equipment and spare parts; (ii) new pumphouses and improved\n            irrigation distribution

facilitate the rehabilitation of the Shasheina Region and\n            provide agricultural machinery and workshops for cotton\n            cultivation in the rest of the BNAC area. The project,\n            situated on both sides of the Blue Nile river from about 30\n            kms upstream of Singa to Sennar, will cover 52,500 feddans\n            and about 50,000 feddans respectively inside and outside the\n            Shasheina Region. The project will improve levels of\n            productivity, particularly for cotton (in both regions),\n            sorghum, groundnuts and vegetables, and introduce fodder\n            crop for livestock (in Shasheina only). As a result, cotton\n            exports will be increased, incomes for the BNAC and the\n            tenants will rise and the schemes will once again be placed\n            on a sound management and financial footing. This will be\n            achieved through provision of: (i) agricultural machinery,\n            equipment and spare parts; (ii) new pumphouses and improved\n            irrigation distribution systems; (iii) buildings for\n            administration, workshops and staff housing; (iv) operating\n            vehicles and a telecommunications network; (v) service roads\n            and potable water supply; and (vi) technical assistance and\n            consultancy services for strengthening management for\n            project implementation and operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan - Blue Nile Pump Schemes\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sudan - Blue Nile Pump Schemes\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/02/726222/sudan-blue-nile-pump-schemes-rehabilitation-project","projn":"SD-Blue Nile Pump -- P002581","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Water Conservation,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Sudan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912510144"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adequate water,adequate water\n            supply,agricultural equipment,Agricultural\n            Production,agricultural\n            research,Agriculture,basins,canals,Cash Flow,Cash\n            Requirements,cereals,channel,channels,clay,Commodity,Commodity\n            Price Projections,construction,consumptive\n            use,conveying,COST RECOVERY,cotton,cotton crop,cotton\n            cultivation,cotton production,cotton stalks,cotton\n            yields,crop,crop diversification,cropping,cropping\n            intensity,crops,Cultivated Area,cultivation,cut\n            off,dam,distribution system,drainage,drainage\n            system,drinking water,dry season,evaporation,excess\n            water,Export,farm,farmers,farming,financial viability,food\n            grains,ginneries,grazing,groundnuts,groundnuts,gum\n            arabic,imports,irri,Irrigation,irrigation scheme,irrigation\n            water,irrigation water supply,labor force,Land Tenure,Land\n            Use,lands,livestock,low rainfall,Natural\n            Resources,Oilseeds,onions,Plant protection,planting,potable\n            water,potable water supply,power generation,Programs,public\n            utility,pump station,Pumping,pumping station,pumping\n            stations,pumps,rainfall,ridging,rivers,salinity,seed,seed\n            cotton,sesame,small farmer,soil\n            surveys,Soils,sorghum,spring,sugar,town,towns,Vegetables,Water\n            requirements,water supplies,water supply,water supply\n            facilities,water supply system,water supply systems,Waters,wheat,winds,Yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"adequate water,adequate water\n            supply,agricultural equipment,Agricultural\n            Production,agricultural\n            research,Agriculture,basins,canals,Cash Flow,Cash\n            Requirements,cereals,channel,channels,clay,Commodity,Commodity\n            Price Projections,construction,consumptive\n            use,conveying,COST RECOVERY,cotton,cotton crop,cotton\n            cultivation,cotton production,cotton stalks,cotton\n            yields,crop,crop diversification,cropping,cropping\n            intensity,crops,Cultivated Area,cultivation,cut\n            off,dam,distribution system,drainage,drainage\n            system,drinking water,dry season,evaporation,excess\n            water,Export,farm,farmers,farming,financial viability,food\n            grains,ginneries,grazing,groundnuts,groundnuts,gum\n            arabic,imports,irri,Irrigation,irrigation scheme,irrigation\n            water,irrigation water supply,labor force,Land Tenure,Land\n            Use,lands,livestock,low rainfall,Natural\n            Resources,Oilseeds,onions,Plant protection,planting,potable\n            water,potable water supply,power generation,Programs,public\n            utility,pump station,Pumping,pumping station,pumping\n            stations,pumps,rainfall,ridging,rivers,salinity,seed,seed\n            cotton,sesame,small farmer,soil\n            surveys,Soils,sorghum,spring,sugar,town,towns,Vegetables,Water\n            requirements,water supplies,water supply,water supply\n            facilities,water supply system,water supply systems,Waters,wheat,winds,Yields"}},"owner":"HQ Anchor: Ethiopia (AFCET)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"3085"},"facets":{}}}
