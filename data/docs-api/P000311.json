The\n            lessons learned indicate that conservation of biodiversity\n            is not the concern of only scientists, government officials,\n            international NGOs, civil society or local population; it\n            requires contributions and cooperation from all of these\n            with the government retaining the initiative and overall\n            leadership. Government ministries in charge of forestry and\n            wildlife have \"public authority\"\n            (\"r\ufffdlien\") duties, which are to enforce forestry\n            and hunting laws and regulations. Local populations must\n            further be allowed to seek cooperation with other potential\n            stakeholders (private operators e.g. logging companies,\n            safari hunters and international NGOs). In a country as\n            diverse in all respects as Cameroon, decentralization is key\n            for the Program to be effective at local level. It is\n            unrealistic to expect concrete achievement in the domain of\n            biodiversity conservation without explicit consent and\n            active participation of local populations. To achieve this,\n            it is necessary to empower these to as great an extent as\n            possible, and to give official recognition to this\n            empowerment. Sustainable sources of funding must be secured\n            in order to strengthen the local organizations, provide\n            adequate compensation for the sacrifices made by local\n            populations for biodiversity conservation, and to sustain\n            community-based development. Effective GIS on all aspects of\n            natural resource management and biodiversity conservation\n            are key to providing information, which must be made\n            available transparently to all stakeholders in order to help\n            in joint decision-making on very sensitive issues. The\n            program initially invested heavily in studies, surveys and\n            consultancies, however without building real capacity in the\n            field or for Ministere de l'Environnement et des For\ufffd\n            (MINEF). The Programme de Conservation et de Gestion de la\n            Biodiversit\ufffdu Cameron (PCGBC) was implemented through a\n            \"program approach\". The Unit\ufffdechnique Op\ufffdtionnelle\n            (\"UTO\") approach was very effective in urgently\n            addressing a situation within a zone that required a direct\n            coordination and approach and helped unite stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Biodiversity Conservation and\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon - Biodiversity\n            Conservation and Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/09/2519883/cameroon-biodiversity-conservation-management-project","projn":"CM-Biodiversity Conserv -- P000311","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Cameroon","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20030925095834"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Forestry","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"Global Environment Project","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Biodiversity conservation; Government\n            officials; Scientists; Nongovernmental organization; Civil\n            society; Local population; Forestry; Wildlife; Hunting;\n            Stakeholders; Hunters; Decentralization; Funding;\n            Compensation; Community development; Decision making;\n            Capacity building"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 3 (AFTS3)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020957-BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION &\n            MANAGEMENT PROJECT,TF023410-SIDA CTF FOR ENVIRONMENT,TF025730-PHRD-BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION\n            & MGMT.

The project will enhance\n            biodiversity conservation and management at six priority\n            project sites. These areas include the coastal\n            Guinea-Congolean refugium and the western highlands.

The project will also finance\n            conservation of savanna ecosystems including implementation\n            of a recovery plan for the endangered black rhinoceros. The\n            project will strengthen key institutions concerned with\n            biodiversity research and provide resources, training and\n            technical assistance to improve their ability to fulfill\n            their mandate.
