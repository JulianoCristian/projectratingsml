While sustainability is likely, it is however\n            subject to a number of risks, namely, the need for further\n            reforms, and, a new course remains to be charted for a\n            viable retirement security system, that encourages private\n            savings. The key lessons convey that: 1) the analytical\n            tools applied, allowed the Borrower to conduct its own\n            analysis, and, staff trained in the use of simulation\n            models, both quantified liabilities, and determined optimal\n            reform strategies. This approach is considered critical in\n            mobilizing essential resource support for future amendments\n            to the Constitution, and further structural reforms; 2) the\n            politics of social security reform should be considered\n            early, to prod a fruitful dialogue, as in this case, the\n            support to provide only modest improvements to the reformed\n            pension system, as requested by the Government, allowed\n            greater influence on the formulation of future reforms; 3)\n            comprehensive public awareness is critical for successful\n            social insurance, and pension reforms, though information on\n            fiscal imbalances of pension systems alone, is not enough,\n            for, inevitably it will hinder the Administration's\n            reform strategy; and, 4) the selection of a single-tranche\n            adjustment instrument, was appropriate, given the\n            politically sensitive policy

The first loan will support the first phase\n            of the Social Security Reform Program. The first phase of\n            the reform consists of a constitutional amendment to modify\n            clauses of the Federal Constitution of 1988 dealing with\n            Social Security, to: a) introduce the principle of actuarial\n            balance; b) replace retirement based on length of service\n            with length of contribution; c) eliminate specific benefit\n            rules from the Federal Constitution; d) eliminate most\n            special pension regimes; and e) reduce inequalities between\n            benefits of public and private sector workers. The first\n            risk of this loan is that the legislature may not approve\n            the imposition of higher pension contributions and income\n            taxes on the politically powerful public sector workers and\n            retirees. The Government has tried to mitigate this risk by\n            widely publicizing the inequities and abuse of the system.\n            Another risk is that states and municipalities may refuse to\n            accept either the limits on their ability to establish their\n            own pension systems or the requirement to introduce\n            automatic adjustments in contributions when net pension\n            payments exceed a determined share of current revenues. This\n            risk is mitigated by reinforcing Federal controls over state\n            and municipal expenditure on salaries and pensions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Social Security Special
