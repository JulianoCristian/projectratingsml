Some\n            lessons learned includes: when, after a steep downward\n            spiral, conditions in a country change for the better, it is\n            important for the Bank to seize the opportunity in a speedy\n            way. Prior actions for a re-engagement operation should be\n            simple and should not require extensive preparatory work.\n            They should demonstrate the Government commitment to make a\n            break with the past practices, which led the country into\n            default. An action plan should be agreed upon with the\n            Government to ensure that the reform process proceeds in an\n            efficient way after Board approval. The letter of\n            development policy should provide a framework for monthly\n            monitoring of the action plan by the Government and the\n            Bank. Technical assistance is generally needed to help the\n            Government move beyond the prior actions. A technical\n            assistance project is under preparation, but its processing\n            is taking much longer than anticipated. The country office\n            should be responsible for monitoring program implementation\n            on a monthly basis. All re-engagement operations are highly\n            risky. Experience shows that the high benefits of these\n            operations generally outweigh their high risks. It shows\n            also that the risk of not doing anything may have highly\n            negative consequences."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Reengagement and Reform Support\n            Grant

While the\n            grant would primarily translate into facilitating arrears\n            clearance to International Development Association (IDA) to\n            allow resumption of Bank's disbursement in support of\n            the transitional poverty reduction strategy, particular\n            attention is given to policy actions aimed at: (i) improving\n            public financial management; (ii) strengthening public\n            sector efficiency and accountability focusing on core\n            personnel management systems and; (iii) fostering\n            transparency in the mining sector. The proposed operation is\n            fully aligned with the Bank's Interim Strategy Note\n            (ISN) for Guinea for the period 2011-12, and with the World\n            Bank's Africa action plan. Given the quick response\n            needed to an emergency situation, the operation does not\n            fully address certain design considerations, per OP 8.60.\n            Deficiencies in economic data due to the deterioration of\n            statistical systems and the impact of the political\n            instability make it difficult to present a reliable analysis\n            of the recent economic developments in Guinea as well\n            medium-term prospects. However, it is clear that since 2008,\n            economic performance in Guinea has deteriorated\n            significantly. Cumulatively, Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\n            per capita declined by 4.6 percent between 2008 and 2010.\n            While agriculture continued to grow modestly, the mining\n            sector historically a major driver of growth contracted in\n            real terms by 6 percent between 2008 and 2010 in spite of\n            rising world prices. The regulatory business environment\n            worsened with the cancellations of contracts in the mining\n            sector, changes of license terms and conditions in the\n
