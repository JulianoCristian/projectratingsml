The\n            conclusion is drawn that the activities established under\n            the project are likely to be sustained, but only due to\n            continued multi-donor support under the Agricultural Sector\n            Public Expenditure Program, and this will require a\n            sustained and concerted effort by all stakeholders. Overall\n            World Bank performance is rated unsatisfactory. The Bank\n            ignored emerging thinking on more client-oriented approaches\n            to extension at the design stage and did not actively\n            explore alternatives over the life of the project. Impact\n            indicators were not identified at the design stage and were\n            never measured. The satisfactory rating on development\n            objective continued for too long. It was noted that, to the\n            credit of both the Bank and the Borrower, that many of the\n            lessons learned from this project were influential in\n            designing the next project (PROAGRI). Overall Borrower\n            performance was also unatisfactory. there were weaknesses in\n            project preparation, delayed and inadequate government\n            funding, inadequate enforcement of rules on financial\n            management and use of public resources, poor implementation\n            of the project, the absence of an effective monitoring and\n            evaluation system, failure to adhere to agreed action plans,\n            and a general reluctance to decentralize."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Agricultural Services\n            Rehabilitation and Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Agricultural\n            Services Rehabilitation and Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1490119/mozambique-agricultural-services-rehabilitation-development-project","projn":"MZ-Agr.Ser.
