Some lessons\n            learned included: HIV/AIDS prevention campaigns designed to\n            reach particular groups have not significantly affected\n            sexual practices. Part of the challenge lies with the fact\n            that key populations at higher risk have to be better\n            involved in the prevention and control work; and a\n            comprehensive training program in behavior change\n            communication (BCC) was in place just before project\n            closing. Separation of biomedical waste is an important\n            public health issue and should be continuously supported.\n            Capacity building on waste management should be continuous\n            due to attrition and the difficulty of maintaining staff up\n            to speed on the latest developments. In Jamaica and\n            elsewhere in the Caribbean, there has been an increasing\n            awareness that enabling environments are critical to the\n            reduction of transmission of HIV/AIDS and increased access\n            to treatment and care. This includes policy and legislative\n            changes and workplace and sector-specific policies and\n            programs, to safeguard privacy, and confidentiality and\n            address stigma and discrimination. Popular figures,\n            particularly those admired by adolescents, need to be\n            engaged in speaking openly about the risk of HIV/AIDS, how\n            to protect themselves, and the importance of knowing their\n            status and seeking appropriate care."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Barbados -  HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Barbados -

countries--in this\n            first phase, Barbados and the Dominican Republic,\n            specifically-- in: a) preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS by\n            reducing transmission among high-risk groups; 2) improving\n            access for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to care that\n            is effective, affordable, and equitable within the context\n            of government health policy; and c) strengthening their\n            institutional capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS in a\n            sustainable way. The development objectives would be\n            country-specific and depend on the stage of the epidemic,\n            income levels, and the socioeconomic status of those who are\n            infected. The interventions chosen for each country project\n            will be based on the countries' epidemiological and\n            programmatic needs, and well-assessed options for meeting\n            them, and include: 1) communication and advocacy to increase\n            government commitment, attention, and funding related to\n            HIV/AIDS and to raise awareness, knowledge, and\n            understanding among the general population about HIV/AIDS;\n            2) scaling up prevention activities at the national and\n            community levels; 3) scaling up care and support activities\n            at the national and community levels; 4) supporting research\n            and surveillance at the national level; and 5) capacity\n            building. Separate, comprehensive PADs are included for\n            Barbados and the Dominican Republic in this report."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and the Caribbean Region -\n            Multi-Country
