Some lessons learned\n            included: in the fiscal reform area, the implementation of\n            tax reductions and minimum corporate taxes needs to more\n            carefully take into account the effects on fiscal revenues,\n            and the tax base, particularly for debt-ridden countries.\n            The corporate tax reduction under the project, while meant\n            to spur development and investment by the private sector,\n            could only be implemented as long as the economy was growing\n            at a rapid pace, and the government's fiscal position\n            was improving. Following an International Monetary Fund\n            (IMF) recommendation mid-way through the project, that the\n            country's fiscal situation necessitated an additional\n            revenue effort, the continued reduction in corporate taxes\n            was halted in order to maintain the fiscal accounts in\n            check. On the private sector side, the implementation of the\n            minimum tax had to be waived, given that many manufacturing\n            companies, who were operating on credit, did not have the\n            cash flow to pay any tax at all. Thus, in future operations\n            which target fiscal incentives for improving private\n            investment, these reforms should be linked to underlying\n            economic conditions with appropriate benchmark indicators.\n            This will allow for realistic adjustments in policy targets\n            of this type, these can be indexed to revenue ratios,\n            especially when they are largely impacted by exogenous\n            economic factors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - Private Sector Development\n            Adjustment
