The\n            objectives of the project were to: (a) improve and\n            rehabilitate roads and bridges;( b) improve coastal shipping\n            operations; and (c) continue strengthening the sector\n            institutions through programs of staff training and\n            technical assistance. The overall rating of the project is\n            just unsatisfactory. Bank\u2019s performance was unsatisfactory\n            in project\u2019s identification, preparation and appraisal but\n            was satisfactory in terms of supervision. Borrower\u2019s\n            performance was marginally satisfactory in preparation,\n            unsatisfactory in implementation and deficient in compliance\n            with loan covenants. The key lessons learned were: (i) an\n            overall development plan should be established wherein the\n            transport sector would be an instrumental component to\n            facilitate the government's objectives; (ii) the\n            transport infrastructure should assure the physical\n            integrity of the country's network, through a careful\n            planning process in order to optimize the funds assignment;\n            and (iii) labor-intensive methods utilized  by small and\n            medium contractors constitute a suitable tool to mitigate\n            unemployment while achieving acceptable rehabilitation and\n            maintenance work."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Seventh Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Haiti - Seventh
