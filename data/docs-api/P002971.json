Lessons convey the following. Pilot\n            and demonstration approaches to reform implementation will\n            not automatically generate or document a learning process,\n            nor will such approaches necessarily lead to a fine-tuning\n            of reforms in light of experience, if they are not well\n            prepared and if they are not fully understood and owned by\n            Government and other stakeholders. Important ingredients to\n            a successful pilot include: the definition of the learning\n            agenda; the definition of the pilot process, including the\n            use of evaluation for scaling-up; a clear and coherent\n            monitoring and evaluation framework, including indicators,\n            tools and methodologies; the availability of essential\n            inputs; a realistic timetable; and strong social and\n            political commitment. The absence of a clear and coherent\n            results framework (clearly stated objectives, well-chosen\n            indicators and a well-defined results chain, linking inputs,\n            outputs, outcomes and impact) is likely to cause confusion\n            among national stakeholders and compromise national\n            understanding and commitment, especially when the project is\n            complex and is supporting far-reaching reforms.

Despite the problems with the project, and the\n            resultant mixed outcomes, the sustainability of the project\n            activities - from the programmatic as well as the financial\n            perspective - is rated as likely. This assessment is based\n            on the fact that the institutions in Uganda, helped by the\n            DHSP, are now stronger and the donors  are working\n            collaboratively with the government of Uganda and each\n            other, within an overall development framework. Given the\n            unsatisfactory performance of the Bank at project\n            identification, preparation, appraisal and for  part of the\n            supervision, and despite the observed improvement in project\n            supervision in the latter half of the  project, the\n            Bank's overall performance must be rated as\n            unsatisfactory. Overall Borrower performance is assessed as\n            partially satisfactory. The project was co-funded by the\n            Government of Sweden and the Government of the Federal\n            Republic of Germany: partner performances were both rated\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned included the following: 1) The\n            project was implemented at a time when Uganda was just\n            recovering  from conflict and internal strife, and\n            furthermore had embarked on an ambitious decentralization\n            agenda that sought to devolve the responsibility for the\n            planning and implementation of essential public  services,\n            including health, to district administrations. Such\n            devolution of power presents several  unique challenges for\n            the design and implementation of Bank supported sectoral\n            projects, that need to  be recognized and effectively\n            managed, but which were underestimated by the project. 2)\n            The project was conceived and designed as a  traditional\n            project, but ended up providing broad programmatic support\n            and gradually developing a  larger group of development\n            partners. The absence of a clear government sectoral policy\n            compounded the situation. This raises substantial questions\n            about the use of a traditional project as the instrument for\n            major sectoral and institutional reform. 3) To be fully\n            effective, reform efforts within the health sector need to\n            explicitly recognize the politics and political economy of\n            the sector; the potential constraints imposed by other\n            ongoing reforms; and the need for early and extensive\n            consultations with relevant stakeholders in order to ensure\n            wide ownership. 4) The project worked with decentralized and\n            community-based  organizations, which was a strong\n            achievement. However, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)\n            were constrained by having to work  through Local Tender\n            Boards. 5) Projects such as this one that work with multiple\n            implementing  partners, such as districts, sub-district\n            entities, and community-based organizations, faith-based\n            organizations, and NGOs need to make multiple advances to\n            those implementing partners and thus require correspondingly\n            larger Special Accounts. 6) A viable and effective\n            monitoring and evaluation framework mutually agreed upon at\n            the time of project  preparation is essential. 7) Effective\n            donor coordination is vital for the improved performance of\n            the health sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - District Health Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - District Health Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2403377/uganda-district-health-project","projn":"UG-District Health Project -- P002971","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Uganda","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20030630112255"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Non-compulsory health finance,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Finance,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Burden of Disease,Community Health,community\n            participation,Cost\n            Effectiveness,Counseling,Decentralization,districts,equipment,financial\n            management,funding mechanisms,gender,health\n            expenditures,health facilities,health financing,health\n            indicators,health needs assessment,health outcomes,Health\n            Policy,health providers,health reform,health reforms,Health\n            Sector,Health Services,health status,Health system,Health\n            system performance,health\n            training,hospitals,Immunization,Immunodeficiency,malaria,motivation,NGOs,nutrition,Primary\n            Health Care,Public Health,public hospitals,public\n            sector,rehabilitation,schools,Sexually Transmitted\n            Infections,supervision,Sustainability,sustainable health care,Workers,workplace"},"1":{"cdata!":"Burden of Disease,Community Health,community\n            participation,Cost\n            Effectiveness,Counseling,Decentralization,districts,equipment,financial\n            management,funding mechanisms,gender,health\n            expenditures,health facilities,health financing,health\n            indicators,health needs assessment,health outcomes,Health\n            Policy,health providers,health reform,health reforms,Health\n            Sector,Health Services,health status,Health system,Health\n            system performance,health\n            training,hospitals,Immunization,Immunodeficiency,malaria,motivation,NGOs,nutrition,Primary\n            Health Care,Public Health,public hospitals,public\n            sector,rehabilitation,schools,Sexually Transmitted\n            Infections,supervision,Sustainability,sustainable health care,Workers,workplace"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 1 (AFTH1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020052-DISTRICT HEALTH SERVICES PILOT\n            & DEMON.

The project is designed to support the\n            Government's strategy of decentralizing health\n            services. It plans to increase the efficiency of the\n            existing health infrastructure and institutions through\n            consolidation and improved management with increased local\n            accountability, while simultaneously supporting cost\n            recovery and budgetary policies that will enable the health\n            care system to move toward long term sustainability. It\n            supports the Government's efforts to reorder priorities\n            within the exisitng health care system through efficiency\n            improvements and by reallocating financial and human\n            resources toward ensuring the provision of a package of\n            essential health services for all Uganda's citizens.\n            Accordingly, the proposed project will: 1) pilot and test\n            new sector policies and strategies which will facilitate the\n            implementation of essential health services; 2) strengthen\n            management and planning capacity at district levels so that\n            they are prepared to provide essential health services; and\n            3) restructure the Ministry of Health so as to build its\n            capacity to provide health policy leadership and to support\n            the Government's decentralization policy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda -

The project is designed to support the\n            Government's strategy of decentralizing health\n            services. It plans to increase the efficiency of the\n            existing health infrastructure and institutions through\n            consolidation and improved management with increased local\n            accountability, while simultaneously supporting cost\n            recovery and budgetary policies that will enable the health\n            care system to move toward long term sustainability. It\n            supports the Government's efforts to reorder priorities\n            within the exisitng health care system through efficiency\n            improvements and by reallocating financial and human\n            resources toward ensuring the provision of a package of\n            essential health services for all Uganda's citizens.\n            Accordingly, the proposed project will: 1) pilot and test\n            new sector policies and strategies which will facilitate the\n            implementation of essential health services; 2) strengthen\n            management and planning capacity at district levels so that\n            they are prepared to provide essential health services; and\n            3) restructure the Ministry of Health so as to build its\n            capacity to provide health policy leadership and to support\n            the Government's decentralization policy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - District Health Services Pilot and\n            Demonstration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - District Health Services\n            Pilot and Demonstration Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/12/732842/uganda-district-health-services-pilot-demonstration-project","projn":"UG-District Health Project -- P002971","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Uganda","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961007040651"},"subsc":"Non-compulsory health finance,Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"annual report,Burden of\n            Disease,clinics,communities,cost effectiveness,death\n            rate,diseases,districts,equipment,Expenditures,Food\n            Products,health care,health centers,health\n            expenditure,health financing,health plans,health\n            policy,health sector,Health Services,health status,health\n            system,hospital beds,Hotels,income,intervention,Life\n            expectancy,Livestock,low-income countries,malaria,Medical\n            Supplies,mortality,NGOs,Nutrition,private sector,Public\n            Health,rehabilitation,service delivery,Small\n            Towns,VILLAGES,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"annual report,Burden of\n            Disease,clinics,communities,cost effectiveness,death\n            rate,diseases,districts,equipment,Expenditures,Food\n            Products,health care,health centers,health\n            expenditure,health financing,health plans,health\n            policy,health sector,Health Services,health status,health\n            system,hospital beds,Hotels,income,intervention,Life\n            expectancy,Livestock,low-income countries,malaria,Medical\n            Supplies,mortality,NGOs,Nutrition,private sector,Public\n            Health,rehabilitation,service delivery,Small\n            Towns,VILLAGES,Water Supply"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 1 (AFTH1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF036503-AFRICA REGION - HEALTH,\n            NUTRITION AND POPULATION,TF034914-EASTERN AFRICA REGION - HEALTH\n            SECTOR REFORM PROJECTS (TANZANIA -,TF020052-DISTRICT HEALTH SERVICES PILOT\n            & DEMON.
