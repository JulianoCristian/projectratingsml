Some of the many lessons\n            convey that: 1) although the financial viability of\n            beneficiary enterprises, is difficult to predict, a good\n            monitoring system, such as the one established under the\n            project, does help maintain a dialogue on the subject, and\n            further investor confidence; 2) combining the Ozone\n            Depleting Substances (ODS) phase-out investments, with\n            legislative controls to discourage the use of ODS (a\n            consumption tax), proved to be an effective experience,\n            resulting in a cooperative relationship between the Ministry\n            of Natural Resources, and the participating enterprises; 3)\n            while the establishment of procurement, and financial\n            management capacity at the start of a project is critical\n            for implementation take-off; in this case however, this\n            proved difficult because of restrictions placed on civil\n            servant staff: this was the one key drawback of\n            implementation arrangements, and furthermore, hampered\n            predictability on the length of time such issues might be\n            resolved; 4) the knowledge of, and reliability on the ODS\n            market, helped build support for the refrigeration servicing\n            initiatives, and, helped regulators decide which enforcement\n            methods would be most appropriate.
