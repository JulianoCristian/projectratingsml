Some lessons learned includes: in a post\n            conflict environment the project design should be kept\n            fairly simple with minimal possible components, focused\n            geographical scope and relatively straight forward\n            development objectives. There is a tendency to rush through\n            the project preparation in emergency situations without\n            giving due attention to implementation challenges.\n            Investment of time in assessing the capacity of the\n            borrower, implementation entity as well as the private\n            sector at the design stage pays off during the\n            implementation phase.
