The\n            measures to be taken at this stage of the program, fall into\n            two main categories. At the macroeconomic level, the\n            adjustment focuses on the development of a medium-term\n            framework, and includes rationalization of public\n            investment, improvement of public expenditure management,\n            import liberalization, credit reform and adoption of a\n            flexible exchange rate policy. At the sectoral level, the\n            program includes: (i) an agriculture sector action program\n            designed to raise output and improve the quality of export\n            crops through adequate incentives to farmers and improvement\n            in the existing processing and marketing capacity, as well\n            as a rationalization of sector organization; (ii) a public\n            enterprise sector reform through restructuring,\n            privatization where possible, and closure if necessary, of\n            key enterprises; and (iii) trade and industrial reform aimed\n            at improving resource allocation, removing the bias against\n            exports, and promoting activities in which the country has a\n            comparative advantage."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Programme d'ajustement structurel"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi \u2013 Projet de soutien au\n            programme d\u2019ajustement structurel : Burundi\u00a0- Programme\n            d\u2019ajustement structurel"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1986/04/10819506/burundi-structural-adjustment-program-project-burundi-programme-dajustement-structurel","projn":"BI-Sac-115813 -- P000200","subtopic":"Economic Stabilization,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform,Environmental Economics & Policies","docty":"President's Report","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","count":"Burundi","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20090715044703"},"subsc":"(Historic)Economic management","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Industry; Import liberalization;\n            Agricultural incentives; Public enterprises;\n            Rationalization; Structural adjustment; Trade; Foreign\n            exchange; Allocation of resources; Policy reform,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Industry; Import liberalization;\n            Agricultural incentives; Public enterprises;\n            Rationalization; Structural adjustment; Trade; Foreign\n            exchange; Allocation of resources; Policy reform,,"}},"owner":"WBOff:Kinshasa-CC2:DRC/CG(Braz) (AFCC2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"P4250","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Programme d'ajustement structurel - Burundi"}}},"facets":{}}}
