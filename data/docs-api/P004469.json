For the, first project,\n            loans 1282-PH and 1272-PH for $32.0 million equivalent were\n            approved on May 27, 1976, including a $10.0 million Third\n            Window Intermediate Term Loan (No. 1272-0-PH). A\n            supplementary loan (1282-1-PH) for $10.5 million equivalent\n            was approved in February 1984 under the Bank's Program\n            of Special Assistance to Member Countries 1983-84. Bank\n            Group financing for the second project was provided through\n            Loan 1647-PH for $26.7 million equivalent, approved on\n            December 21, 1978. The final loan disbursement on the first\n            project was made in July 1986 and the undisbursed balance of\n            $3.2 million equivalent was cancelled. For the second\n            project, the final disbursement was made July 24, 1985 and\n            the undisbursed balance of $1.4 million equivalent was\n            cancelled. The PPAR consists of the following: (a) a Project\n            Completion Report (PCR) on the first project, dated April\n            1986, prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office;\n            (b) a PCR on the second project, dated December 1986,\n            prepared by the Borrower and supplemented by the East Asia\n            and Pacific Region memorandum of December 31, 1986; and (c)\n            a Project Performance Audit Memorandum (PPAM) prepared by\n            the Operations Evaluation Department (OED). At the sector\n            level, the Audit attributes the modest policy gains achieved\n            by the projects largely to the lack of an effective dialogue\n            between the Borrower and the Bank on several important\n            sector issues such as housing finance and relocation of\n            squatter settlements. It is conceivable that by slowing down\n            the pace of sector lending the Bank might have better\n            assisted the Borrower in Instituting needed sector policy\n            reforms. Fortunately, however, both the Region and the\n            Borrower report the lessons learned from the experience of\n            these first two projects are presently being applied to the\n            restructuring of on-going operations and are likely to\n            improve future project performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -
