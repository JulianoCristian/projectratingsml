The project\n            achieved many of its objectives, institutional development\n            was modest, sustainability is likely, and the performance of\n            both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, while some reforms\n            hinge on executive and/or legislative decisions and can be\n            implemented quickly, the economic response and effects\n            depend on changes in the behavior of people and are much\n            slower in becoming manifest. Second, still other reforms\n            involve institutional changes which can only be put into\n            place slowly and are dependent on the availability of\n            skilled people to design, implement, and manage these\n            changes. Finally, in both cases, realistic expectations\n            require that an adequate time span is allowed for the\n            desired effects to appear."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Structural
