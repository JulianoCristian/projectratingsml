Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) Community-driven development(CDD)\n            mechanisms can improve the quality and targeting of\n            non-project public resources while leveraging complementary,\n            parallel funding and deepening the investment stock needed\n            for faster poverty reduction; 2) Electricity and water\n            supply investments have immediate impact on quality of life\n            and are an essential component of productive and many other\n            activities/functions; 3) CDD can be an effective mechanism\n            for productive investments which integrate small-scale\n            producers with markets; 4) Political, bureaucratic and\n            financial impediments to implementation require astute\n            supervision with clear objectives; 5) Systematic impact\n            evaluation requires more intensive focus; 6) CDD can\n            effectively target and empower poor rural women; 7) CDD is\n            appropriate for ethnic groups and indigenous peoples; 8)\n            Loan size should be calibrated to Borrower fiscal capacity;\n            and 9) Successful projects require in-country leadership and\n            managers of high caliber."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
