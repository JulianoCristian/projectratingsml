Some lessons learned includes: lack of\n            effective sensitization and adequate human resource in\n            implementing institutions hinder delivery of emergency\n            operations.

Negative impacts include: local air\n            pollution, minimal local air pollution, pollution of surface\n            water due to runoff and improper application, impede\n            movement of livestock due to gullies, disposal of used oil,\n            and disposal of used spare parts.
