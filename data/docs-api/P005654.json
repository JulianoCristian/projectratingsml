Experts estimated the probability of re-occurrence\n            of a similar flood at 0.66 percent-in layman's terms\n            the disaster was a 130 year event. A survey assessed\n            economic losses at about US$80 million. Seventy lives were\n            lost, more than 700 houses were destroyed and 8,000 damaged;\n            along with streets, roads, bridges, railways, power supply\n            lines, and telecommunication equipment. . The Sfax Flood\n            Protection Project was the first free standing flood\n            protection project in Tunisia in which the Bank was\n            involved. The main objective of the project was to minimize\n            the damage potential of future flooding in Sfax. Secondary\n            objectives were: reducing the risk of life losses; providing\n            the population with a greater sense of security; reducing\n            economic losses to production and assets (mainly real\n            estate); and ensuring permanent and efficient maintenance of\n            the flood protection infrastructure. The project completion\n            report and audit of the project concluded that the project\n            infrastructure had reduced the risk of flood, although both\n            documents noted that the system had yet to be fully tested.\n            The operations and Operations Evaluation Department (OED)\n            evaluations concurred that, overall, the project contributed\n            significantly to the urban development of Sfax. The audit\n            noted that the need for a quick response had foreclosed the\n            opportunity for meaningful beneficiary participation in\n            project planning. The impact evaluation of the Sfax Flood\n            Protection Project concentrates primarily on those impacts\n            related to the flood protection canal and the associated\n            bypass highway, and it also assesses medium-and long-term\n            impacts on stakeholders, as well as the medium and long-term\n            impacts on the urban development of the city itself."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Reducing Flood Hazards and Traffic\n            Congestion : SFAX Flood Protection Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Reducing Flood

The main objective of the disaster\n            relief project was to minimize the flood damage potential in\n            Greater Sfax by: (a) reducing the risk of loss of life from\n            floods; (b) providing the population with a greater sense of\n            security; protecting public and private property; (c)\n            reducing production losses; and (d) ensuring permanent and\n            efficient maintenance of flood protection infrastructure.\n            The project consisted of the following physical components:\n            (a) rehabilitation of the water course of Oued Ezzit on the\n            northern side of Sfax; (b) rehabilitation and extension of\n            the existing dikes along Oued Maou and Oued Khalifa on the\n            southern side of Sfax; (c) construction of an eight-km long\n            belt canal at about four km from the city center; (d) minor\n            flood protection works in neighboring villages; (e)\n            provision of equipment to maintain the flood control\n            facilities; and (f) staffing, equipping, and operation of a\n            special flood protection Section within the Regional\n            Directorate of the Ministry of Equipment in Sfax to be\n            responsible for maintenance and repairs of flood protection works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisie - Projet de Protection de la Ville\n            de Sfax Contre les Inondations"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisie \u2013 Projet de protection de\n            la ville de Sfax contre les inondations : Tunisie\u00a0- Projet\n            de protection de la ville de Sfax contre les inondations"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/01/12691995/tunisia-sfax-flood-protection-project-tunisie-projet-de-protection-de-la-ville-de-sfax-contre-les-inondations","projn":"TN-Sfax Flood Protection -- P005654","subtopic":"Flood Control,Water Law,Engineering,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Environmental Disasters & Degradation","docty":"Project Completion Report","teratopic":"Environment,Science and Technology Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Tunisia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100825042020"},"subsc":"Sewerage","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Environment,Science and Technology Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Flood control; Embankments; Canals;\n            Waterways; Maintenance equipment,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Flood control; Embankments; Canals;\n            Waterways; Maintenance equipment,,"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"9877","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Projet de Protection de la Ville de Sfax\n            Contre les Inondations - Tunisie"}}},"722920":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1983/04/722920/tunisia-sfax-flood-protection-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1983/04/722920/tunisia-sfax-flood-protection-project","new_url":"1983/04/722920/tunisia-sfax-flood-protection-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/02/24/000178830_98101902421142/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/02/24/000178830_98101902421142/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2289","docdt":"1983-04-30T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2000-02-24T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Sfax Flood Protection Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Sfax Flood Protection Project will\n            minimize loss of life, protect public and private property,\n            reduce production losses from floods, and ensure permanent,\n            efficient maintenance of flood protection infrastructure in\n            Sfax and surrounding areas.
