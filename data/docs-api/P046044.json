This decree increases\n            security for rights to land and real estate, facilitates\n            transactions in land and real estate, and promotes credit\n            systems development.

The project comprises three components:  (1)\n            institution building; (2) establishment of the registration\n            system; and (3) map production.  The first component\n            consists of developing a Project Implementation Unit,\n            providing technical assistance in elaborating and testing\n            aspects of the registration system, and implementing\n            training programs.

The third component tests\n            and elaborates map digitization on a pilot basis, trains\n            staff, examines the economic costs and benefits of shifting\n            from paper-based maps to electronic maps, and establishes a\n            digitization center that will add parcel boundary\n            information to these base maps."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakstan - Real Estate Registration Pilot Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kazakstan - Real Estate\n            Registration Pilot Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/03/694910/kazakstan-real-estate-registration-pilot-project","projn":"KZ-Real Estate Registration Pilot Project -- P046044","subtopic":"Real Estate Development,Municipal Housing and Land,Land and Real Estate Development,Urban Housing,Environmental Economics & Policies","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Urban Development","count":"Kazakhstan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970716145323"},"subsc":"Law and justice,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1997-1","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Urban Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to information,agricultural\n            land,apartment,apartment\n            buildings,apartments,architecture,Bidding,cities,Civil\n            Code,Construction,economists,farms,houses,Inventory,land\n            administration,Land Code,Land Management,land market,land\n            owner,Land Reform,land resources,Land Tenure,land\n            titling,land use,legislation,market economies,private\n            land,private ownership,private rights,Property Rights,Real\n            Estate,real estate,real estate appraisal,real estate\n            development,real estate markets,Real Estate\n            Registration,real property,registration,Structural\n            Adjustment,towns,urban areas"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to information,agricultural\n            land,apartment,apartment\n            buildings,apartments,architecture,Bidding,cities,Civil\n            Code,Construction,economists,farms,houses,Inventory,land\n            administration,Land Code,Land Management,land market,land\n            owner,Land Reform,land resources,Land Tenure,land\n            titling,land use,legislation,market economies,private\n            land,private ownership,private rights,Property Rights,Real\n            Estate,real estate,real estate appraisal,real estate\n            development,real estate markets,Real Estate\n            Registration,real property,registration,Structural\n            Adjustment,towns,urban areas"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"1":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"2":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"3":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"4":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"}},"trustfund":"TF035995-KAZAKHSTAN - REAL ESTATE REGISTRATION,TF035960-KAZAKSTAN - REAL ESTATE\n            REGISTRATION PILOT","repnb":"15994"},"facets":{}}}
