Following are some of\n            the lessons learned: In the process of building ownership\n            for sustainable coastal tourism, it is important to\n            integrate both short- and long-term incentives. The\n            potential of tourism income from larger-scale investments in\n            the Caribbean is very attractive, but it can conflict with\n            smaller-scale, community-based tourism and the interests of\n            local communities. Honduras has increased its numbers of\n            visitors, but it still remains in fourth place in terms of\n            number of tourism arrivals in Central America. Future\n            projects will need to continue overall strengthening of the\n            human resource capacity in the municipalities in Honduras.\n            The integration of a cultural heritage revitalization\n            component in a tourism project can have a multiplier effect\n            on other initiatives in a community. It is important to\n            assess the implementation capacity of the government agency\n            to implement these types of funds, as well as consider\n            contracting fund management out to third parties. In the\n            first call for proposals, many potential beneficiaries\n            lacked complete business plans. A strong social\n            communications campaign is needed when launching this type\n            of fund."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Sustainable Coastal Tourism

    coastal tourism. The components will: 1) formulate, and\n            promote a participatory approach to policy dialogue, with\n            public, and private stakeholders at the national, regional,\n            and local levels, through workshops to formulate strategic\n            tourism in the area, develop community participation, and\n            institutional arrangements. A major land titling diagnostic\n            on indigenous communities of the North Coast, should\n            recommend actions to formalize recognition of indigenous\n            land rights, as well as satisfactory conflict resolution.\n            Technical assistance will be provided to promote, and\n            implement policy reforms, legal and regulatory frameworks,\n            and, improve institutional arrangements. This includes\n            tourism audits, legal, and technical aspects related to\n            titling of communal land, as well as campaigns focused on\n            HIV/AIDS prevention, and control; 2) develop the capacity of\n            coastal municipalities, which includes the private sector,\n            and community based organizations, through skills training\n            in environmental management, tourism management, and\n            entrepreneurship. In addition, a cultural tourism site will\n            be restored at the historic center of Trujillo; 3) design,\n            and deliver micro, and small business enterprise training to\n            stimulate productive capacity, and create business\n            opportunities, i.e., handicrafts, tour operations, and\n            adventures travel, and, 4) support project management,\n

It identifies the beneficiaries, and\n            stakeholders, to determine possible negative impacts on\n            their activities, and to minimize the social constraints\n            thereof. Ethnic representation revealed a larger percentage\n            of mestizo population, with only a thirty percent indigenous\n            population; however, it also revealed strong ties among\n            indigenous populations in the protected areas, between the\n            control of natural resources, and their cultural heritage.\n            Further review analyzed education, and health aspects, land\n            ownership, labor trends, and land uses. Measures to minimize\n            social adversity include: 1) interagency coordination to\n            identify property titles, and settle land\n            conflicts/disputes, with the support of

migration patterns, and sexual behavior (within\n            cultural parameters); and, 4) technical training for the\n            development, and quality control of native, or indigenous\n
