The sustainability of\n            the project is highly likely. For both the World Bank and\n            the Borrower, overall performance was satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned included the following: The key to a successful\n            project in a post-conflict context, with a newly formed and\n            inexperienced government body, is to establish a\n            well-designed and simple framework for project management.\n            Here, simple but comprehensive responsibility matrices\n            facilitated successful implementation. The Staff Appraisal\n            Report clearly spelled out staffing and functions of the\n            PCUs in great detail. Second, the Borrower should ensure\n            that donors' contributions are properly coordinated\n            with overall program objectives. The education and health\n            ministries will need to develop their institutional\n            capacities to ensure this coordination. Third, timely use of\n            technical assistance is critical for project success; there\n            has been lack of clarity about TA needs and implementing\n            agencies have lacked absorptive capacity. Fourth,\n            operational support to implementing units is critical to\n            establishing technical and managerial capacity. Also\n            integration of the implementing unit into the structure of\n            the ministry, and continuity of implementation staff, are\n            needed for sustained supoport when a project closes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Education and Health\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"West Bank and Gaza - Education\n            and Health Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/12/1725278/west-bank-gaza-education-health-rehabilitation-project","projn":"GZ-Education And Health Rehabilitation\n            Project -- P035996","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Curriculum & Instruction,Housing & Human Habitats,Teaching and Learning,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Education","count":"West Bank and Gaza","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02031504080344"},"subsc":"Primary education,Central government administration,Secondary education,Health","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,addiction,addition,adolescents,classrooms,clinics,Community\n            Development,community health,development\n            projects,diabetes,Education Programs,educational\n            materials,educators,Employment,environmental\n            education,environmental issues,equipment,financial\n            management,funding mechanisms,Gender,girls,Health\n            Education,Health Promotion,health\n            services,hospitals,infectious\n            diseases,integration,learning,learning activities,ministries\n            of Education,NGOs,nurses,parents,population groups,preschool\n            children,Primary Education,primary health care,Private\n            sector,public health,public safety,Public\n            sector,safety,School Health,schools,small\n            classes,smoking,teacher,teachers,training of teachers,waste"},"1":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,addiction,addition,adolescents,classrooms,clinics,Community\n            Development,community health,development\n            projects,diabetes,Education Programs,educational\n            materials,educators,Employment,environmental\n            education,environmental issues,equipment,financial\n            management,funding mechanisms,Gender,girls,Health\n            Education,Health Promotion,health\n            services,hospitals,infectious\n            diseases,integration,learning,learning activities,ministries\n            of Education,NGOs,nurses,parents,population groups,preschool\n            children,Primary Education,primary health care,Private\n            sector,public health,public safety,Public\n            sector,safety,School Health,schools,small\n            classes,smoking,teacher,teachers,training of teachers,waste"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF035327-WEST BANK AND GAZA PROGRAM,TF033689-MENA REGION - EDUCATION,TF022924-ITIALIAN COFINANCING OF\n            EDUCATION AND HEALTH REHABILITAITON PROJECT,TF026062-EDUCATION AND HEALTH\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF026051-ITALY/WBG EDUCATION &\n            HEALTH REHAB.
