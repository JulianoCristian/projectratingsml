Some lessons learned included: first,\n            strong Government ownership of the reform program was\n            crucial to the success and rapid pace of the PRSO series.\n            The authorities took the lead in identifying and\n            implementing the reform program, with the Bank playing a\n            catalytic and supportive role in identifying ways to enhance\n            what the Government had already decided to implement on an\n            accelerated time schedule. Second, the strong focus of the\n            Government on results was vital in driving implementation of\n            the reform agenda. The authorities were sharply focused on\n            achieving specific development outcomes and results, and the\n            PRSO team supported the authorities in developing a detailed\n            set of monitorable outcome indicators to track results from\n            implementation of the reform program. Third, the\n            programmatic approach afforded important flexibility to\n            advance and deepen reform implementation in several areas\n            and reduce the scope of or provide additional time for\n            implementation in other areas. Fourth, strong donor\n            coordination to strengthen the Government's\n            implementation capacity was essential. The Bank's\n            projects and other donors provided important technical\n            assistance to build capacity in key areas. Areas in which\n            Bank projects complemented the reforms supported by the PRSO\n            series included public sector reform, education, and health\n            care. Finally, reform progress can be achieved in areas\n            without a clear reform champion if the area is selected\n            carefully and if a flexible approach is adopted. A number of\n            areas in serious need of reform, including external audit,\n            civil service and procurement, lacked a clear reform\n            champion. Given that the PRSO program was broad and\n            ambitious, the Bank was selective in pursuing challenging\n            reform areas that lacked a reform champion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia -
