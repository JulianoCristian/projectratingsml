The relevance rating would have been\n            higher had it not been for ERP's fourth humanitarian\n            objective, which was only modestly relevant to BiH's\n            reconstruction. Emergency Landmines Clearance Project: the\n            project objectives were modestly relevant to BiH's\n            post-conflict recovery program. Both efficacy and efficiency\n            in achieving the objectives were negligible; project\n            objectives were not met, yet substantial costs were\n            incurred. Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration\n            Project: for a country in an emergency post-conflict\n            situation the project objectives were modestly relevant;\n            they emphasized longer-term goals too much, even though they\n            neglected demobilization itself. Efficacy in achieving the\n            relevant objectives was modest, through the effective\n            support the project gave to reintegrating demobilized\n            combatants, albeit on a small scale and fewer than targeted.\n            Local Initiatives Project: All three project objectives were\n            highly relevant to the post-conflict development needs and\n            policies pursued in BiH, already more than a year out of the\n            war when this project began.

Given\n            Bosnia and Herzegovina's transitional stage, it was\n            necessary that two entity level employment, and training\n            foundations (ETF) be created, so as to focus attention on\n            implementation issues; likewise, the creation of the Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) was also necessary, since the\n            employment bureaus were still not ready to provide\n            demand-driven redeployment services, nor to provide the\n            environment to promote social dialogue. For the long-run it\n            is thus suggested that the PIUs be permanently integrated so\n            as to institutionalize the management experience gained from\n            active labor programs, and ETFs. However, ETF programs still\n            require considerable reform, to administer unemployment\n            benefits, and a range of active labor programs, including\n            new labor redeployment mechanisms. Moreover, it has been\n            puzzling (given the funding capacity of the project, not\n            only from the Bank loan itself, but from donations from the\n            Dutch, and Swedish Governments), why those shorter term\n            activities, i.e., public works and small credits, were so\n            much more successful in locking in additional donor support,\n            a fact worth investigating further. Thus, lessons suggest a\n            simpler project scope; relevancy of procurement rules in\n            accordance to country circumstances; greater private sector,\n            and local nongovernmental organizations' involvement;\n            and, stronger technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -
