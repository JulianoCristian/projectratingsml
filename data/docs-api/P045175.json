Institutional and stakeholder\n            analyses are essential during the design of the reforms and\n            to inform decisions during implementation about when to\n            intervene and when not to. Stakeholder consultations can\n            help to flag possible resistance and solutions. Information\n            and outreach to all stakeholders and the public to explain\n            the reforms, the benefits of the reforms, and how the public\n            will be affected should be an integral part of the reform\n            process. The presence of a local reform team with the\n            willingness, technical capacity and political support to\n            lead the process is also important to ensure success. Since\n            health reform usually takes place over a long period, it is\n            important to assess fully the political economy of reform\n            and to prepare a proactive plan to address this issue,\n            including generating evidence that reforms work and\n            enlisting key stakeholders in the system that are vested in\n            the reforms and likely to remain on place. The piloting and\n            sequencing of reforms are important implementation\n            modalities to maximize the chances of success. Collaboration\n            between several ministries may be essential to develop an\n            effective tool to identify the poor. There is a need for\n            clear criteria to identify the poor and outreach/awareness\n            campaigns to inform people about the exemption policy and\n            the procedures to be followed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Health Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Health Sector Reform

There\n            is no change to the project description. The original\n            project development objectives are to: (1) improve\n            population health status and well being in three pilot\n            Governorates through universal coverage to a basic package\n            of primary health care and public health services; and (2)\n            improve access to efficiency and quality of primary health\n            care services in three pilot Governorates. It is proposed to\n            amend the project development objective by removing\n            \"universal coverage\" as an explicit development\n            objective as there have been delays in passing the universal\n            health insurance law, and to limit the coverage to two\n            Governorates instead of three. The proposed project\n            development objectives would thus read: \"The objectives\n            of the Project are to expand health coverage with a basic\n            package of primary health care and public health services to\n            the poor population in two pilot Governorates and improve\n            access and efficiency of primary health care services\n            through rationalization of health infrastructure in two\n            pilot Governorates.\""},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Health Sector Reform Project :\n            proposed project restructuring and amendment of the credit agreement"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Health Sector Reform\n            Project : proposed project restructuring and amendment of\n            the credit agreement"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4044687/egypt-health-sector-reform-project-proposed-project-restructuring-amendment-credit-agreement","projn":"EG-Health Sector Reform -- P045175","docty":"Board Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Health Economics & Finance,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040607172057"},"subsc":"Compulsory health finance,Health","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Board Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"audits,Bank supervision,Central\n            Bank,Expenditures,health care services,health\n            insurance,Health Sector,health status,laws,poverty\n            reduction,primary health care,public health,public health\n            services,quality standards,supervision"},"1":{"cdata!":"audits,Bank supervision,Central\n            Bank,Expenditures,health care services,health\n            insurance,Health Sector,health status,laws,poverty\n            reduction,primary health care,public health,public health\n            services,quality standards,supervision"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF027142-PHRD-HEALTH SECTOR REFORM\n            PROJECT (RECIPIENT-EXECUTED),TF027166-PHRD-HEALTH SECTOR REFORM PRO.
