Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            moderately satisfactory performance ratings. There have been\n            a series of restructurings to the Project as follows: (1)\n            clarify funding arrangements for DRC\u0092s participation in the\n            African Trade Insurance (ATI) agency (also the project\n            closing date was extended by one month). (2) to add\n            additional financing to support a new microfinance activity,\n            a national payments system, and extend the voluntary\n            retirement program to SNCC, among others. (3) to extend the\n            closing date of the original credit by eight months. (4) to\n            extend the closing dates of both the original credit and the\n            additional financing by five months. (5) to extend the\n            project\u0092s closing date an additional five months for a total\n            extension of nineteen months in order to allow completion of\n            the Management Action Plan of the Inspection Panel case, as\n            well as ensure uninterrupted support to the modernization of\n            the National Payments System. As part of the additional\n            financing component 1 was updated to (i) support the growth\n            of microfinance institutions (MFIs), and strengthening their\n            oversight by BCC in order to promote SMEs; (ii) developing a\n            National Payments System (NPS) to strengthen financial\n            intermediation; and (iii) supporting the process of DRC\u0092s\n            adherence to the Organization for Harmonization of Business\n            Laws in Africa. Component 2 was also updated to (a) finance\n            the SNCC stabilization contract and development of a\n            concession plan; and (b) facilitate the SNCC staff severance\n            process. Lessons learned from the project include the\n            following: (1) Monitoring and Evaluation Systems should be\n            constantly revisited for continued pertinence. (2) In a\n            fragile environment, it is important to moderate\n            expectations in project design. (3) Flexibility at project\n            and country program level is critical in post-conflict\n            situations. (4) It is important to pair SOE reforms with\n            pension reforms as part of the Country Program, especially\n            where staff reductions are a significant element. (5)\n            Credible permanent institutions in a volatile environment\n            are critical in championing reforms. (6) Field Team\n            Leadership is important in fragile environments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo - Private Sector Development and\n            Competitiveness
