Social Inclusion Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Social Inclusion Project for Romania\n            was developed to improve the living conditions and the\n            social inclusion of the most disadvantaged/vulnerable people\n            (Roma, persons with disabilities, children at risk, victims\n            of domestic violence) and also to strengthen the\n            administration of social assistance benefits. The project\n            development objective was largely met, but project\n            implementation was much slower than anticipated. This was\n            mainly due to long and cumbersome domestic procedures for\n            the approval of the sub-projects and related investments,\n            and the poor institutional capacity of the local\n            administration which affected mainly Component 3 (Social\n            Assistance Services). Disbursements rose to 68 percent of\n            the total loan funds (EURO denominated). The project's\n            implementation provides several lessons. For example,\n            project design should set out a clear definition of what\n            constitutes social inclusion, how to measure it, and a\n            theory of change for the project overall; design needs to\n            incorporate a comprehensive pre-assessment of institutional\n            capacities; decentralized and centralized implementation\n            models present potential tensions that need to be considered\n            explicitly during project preparation; the establishment of\n            a coordination mechanism among project components is\n            important, especially when multiple implementing agencies\n            are involved; there is a potential trade-off between rapid\n            preparation of a project and establishing an effective\n            monitoring and evaluation system; committed leadership and\n            champions have a critical role to play in laying the\n            foundations for social inclusion; project design should\n            consider flexible and tailored arrangements that allow for\n            intra-community and spatial-sensitive approaches; the role\n            of and consultation with NGOs and civil society should be\n            embedded within the project cycle on inclusion projects;\n            finally, pilot experiences can provide an effective\n            instrument to test alternative approaches to implementation\n            of assistance delivery models."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Social Inclusion Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Social
