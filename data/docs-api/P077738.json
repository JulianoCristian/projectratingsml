Some lessons learned\n            included: simpler project designs including less components,\n            sub-components and activities as well as simpler\n            disbursement mechanisms are recommended, especially in\n            situations where the Borrower lacks previous familiarity\n            working with the Bank, the policy dialogue is new (with\n            little to no institutional framework for change) and the\n            implementation context is underpinned by a volatile and\n            unpredictable political environment. The establishment of\n            the Directorate as an independent project management entity\n            decoupled from its parent ministry the Ministry of Education\n            and Science (MES) likely decreased project ownership and\n            engagement by the MES, increased implementation\n            ineffectiveness due to tensions and lack of coordination\n            between the Ministry and the implementation unit and did not\n            ensure sustainability of a significant number of activities\n            at the completion of the project. A project like this one\n            needed to be more decentralized in the way it was\n            implemented at the Oblast and rayon levels in the\n            preparation as well as in the implementation phases. The\n            actual implementation of this operation was highly\n            centralized in a largely ineffectual Directorate that\n            resulted in an unsatisfactory physical and financial project\n            performance. The need for an appropriate and thorough\n            institutional capacity and readiness assessment during the\n            preparation stage is strongly recommended to improve the\n            implementation readiness conditions which did not exist for\n            this operation. As it turned out, neither the Directorate\n            nor the MES were well positioned to implement and monitor\n            the several project activities included in a rather complex\n            project design. For example, no detection was ever made\n            during preparation about the potential financial bottlenecks\n            that plagued the entire implementation cycle."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Equal Access to Quality Education\n            in Ukraine Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ukraine - Equal Access to Quality\n            Education in
