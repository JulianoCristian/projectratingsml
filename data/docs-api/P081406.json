Some lessons learned\n            included: competitively designed and organized competitive\n            bidding among qualified contractors gave Compania Nationala\n            de Transport al Energiei Electrice (Transelectrica) good\n            performance at competent prices, well below original cost\n            Estimates, also self-evident but nevertheless a lesson worth\n            noting. The development of a functioning electricity market\n            is a complex undertaking which Romania, the Government and\n            the project's three executing agencies, accomplished\n            successfully with the support of the project. A clear\n            strategy (the road map); competent and committed staff in\n            three executing agencies; close coordination between the\n            agencies, with the Government, and with the European\n            Commission and the Bank; and support by highly qualified\n            consultants with hands-on experience were the key\n            ingredients for Romania's success. Transelectrica\n            experiences and expects increasing challenges, difficulties,\n            and delays in its projects involving land acquisition. To\n            mitigate land acquisition delay risks, the Government could\n            explore amendments to Romania's land acquisition\n            framework for those energy projects which the Government\n            deems to be priority projects of public/national interest.\n            This can be done by streamlining procedures and updating the\n            law in force, in order to avoid delays due to disputes\n            settlement over compensation levels."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Electricity Market Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Electricity

           Project for Romania as highly satisfactory. This project is\n            an excellent example of a quick response to an immediate\n            request by the client for assistance in meeting the urgent\n            need for transmission investments and support for\n            development of its power market. Strong government support\n            at the highest levels insured both rapid processing and a\n            high quality product. The Bank, on its part, was able to\n            field an experienced team able to draw on the Bank's\n            global experience, particularly in the development of\n            competitive power markets. This is an area in which the Bank\n            has a strong competitive advantage and consequently, high\n            value added. The project was appraised in a highly\n            professional manner with all aspects receiving careful\n            attention. The project is also notable for its close\n            coordination with other donors. The European institutions\n            are active in this country and responsible for most of the\n            investments made. They have accepted the Bank's\n            preeminent role in market development and have closely\n            coordinated their investments with the Bank. More\n            importantly, the country itself has taken on the major role\n            in coordinating the various donors and has produced a road\n            map outlining sector policy as a part of the preparation for\n            this project. This project was not originally in the\n            program. The country assistance strategy (CAS) assumed this\n            was a sector in which the Bank could withdraw because the\n            international private sector would be forthcoming with the\n            necessary resources. This assumption proved to be incorrect\n            and it took both time and pressure from the country to alter\n            the Bank's perspective.  The Bank probably needs to be\n            more flexible in its programming, particularly in middle\n            income countries that are capable of identifying their need\n            to change priorities in response to changing circumstances."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Electricity Market Project : sixth\n            quality at entry assessment (QEA6)  - investment lending questionnaire"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Electricity Market\n            Project : sixth quality at entry assessment (QEA6)  -\n            investment lending questionnaire"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2003/07/10030691/romania-electricity-market-project-sixth-quality-entry-assessment-qea6-investment-lending-questionnaire","projn":"RO-Electricity Market Project -- P081406","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"m,Environmental Economics & Policies,Housing & Human Habitats,Debt Markets,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Environment","count":"Romania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20081118003335"},"theme":"Regional integration,Regulation and competition policy","subsc":"Power","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, assessment process, auditing,\n            Bank lending, Bank policies, Banks, beneficiaries, best\n            practice, best practices, borrower, capacity building, cash\n            flow, conditionality, contribution, Contributions, cost\n            recovery, debt, debt service, disbursement, disbursements,\n            division of labor, economic policy environment,\n            Environmental, environmental impacts, environmental\n            policies, financial analysis, financial covenants, Financial\n            Management, Financial management capacity, financial\n            performance, financial rate of return, financial ratios,\n            financial risks, fiscal sustainability, Forestry, Gender,\n            Gender Equality, gender issues, General public, government\n            expenditures, Government ownership, government support,\n            Habitats, Human Development, income, Indigenous Peoples,\n            Infrastructure Development, institutional capacity,\n            INSTRUMENT, internal controls, investment program, lending\n            instrument, loan, Macroeconomic Management, marginal cost,\n            market development, policy environment, Primary Education,\n            public expenditure, QUESTIONNAIRE, recurrent cost,\n            Resettlement, resource management, responsibilities, Risk\n            Assessment, risk aversion, Safety, self finance, spot\n            market, stakeholder, stakeholders, tariff system, technical\n            assistance, term contracts"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"majtheme":"Trade and integration,Financial and private sector development","repnb":"46480"},"2359341":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/05/2359341/romania-electricity-market-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/05/2359341/romania-electricity-market-project","new_url":"2003/05/2359341/romania-electricity-market-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/05/27/000160016_20030527120217/Rendered/INDEX/25689.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/05/27/000160016_20030527120217/Rendered/PDF/25689.pdf","datestored":"2003-05-27T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2003-05-20T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Romania - Electricity Market Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the\n            Electricity Market Project for Romania is to develop a\n            well-functioning wholesale electricity market with the aim\n            of: (a) putting in place a transparent and predictable\n            commercial and regulatory framework and a power exchange\n            that will facilitate electricity trading within a\n            competitive national, regional and eventually European\n            market; and (b) improving the efficiency and reliability of\n            the transmission system in order to support trading and\n            supply electricity at least cost to consumers. A\n            well-functioning wholesale electricity market is an integral\n            component of Romania's strategy to attract and sustain\n            private sector participation in power sector renewal,\n            especially for the refurbishment o f power distribution and\n            generation assets, and to develop a more efficient and\n            increasingly competitive power sector. There are two main\n            project components. The project will be implemented by\n            Transelectrica (Romania's grid company and power system\n            operator), OPCOM (\"Operator Commercial,\" the\n            subsidiary of the national power company and Romania's\n            power market operator),  and ANRE (the regulatory agency for\n            electricity and heat).
