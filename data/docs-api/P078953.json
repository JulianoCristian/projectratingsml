Some\n            lessons learned included: during the past years, the Bank\n            has systematically invested efforts in promoting operations\n            with multiple sub-executing units. This has been based on\n            the documented evidence about how inter-institutional\n            coordination supports the attainment of common goals.\n            Results, however, have been rather ambiguous. On the one\n            hand, institutions have partially coordinated their\n            activities as a consequence of external pressure imposed on\n            them. On the other, however, communication and information\n            flow has not yet been institutionalized and only takes place\n            if there is an external facilitator promoting it. Thus, the\n            cost-effectiveness of such efforts has not yet proved to be\n            positive since they turn out to be extremely demanding in\n            terms of time, resources and energy. In sum,\n            inter-institutional coordination cannot be promoted from a\n            top-down approach. It rather needs to be part of a bottom-up\n            strategy that departs from the sectors themselves.\n            Experience shows that project technical staffs usually lack\n            time to coordinate. In addition, when they submit documents\n            (i.e., terms of reference, proposal, deliverables) to the\n            Bank they usually press for immediate approval which takes\n            longer than expected provided the Bank has further\n            observations and recommendations. Based on these facts, as\n            part of Social Technical Assistance Lending (TAL)\n            implementation, the Bank promoted a technical coordination\n            space with participation of all relevant actors. This\n            facilitated discussion, feedback and informal approval of\n            outputs in order to expedite the administrative procedures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Accountability for
