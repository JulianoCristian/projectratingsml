It enabled organization wide familiarization with\n            modern rules for procurement and disbursement to carry out\n            project operations timely and efficiently. Institutional\n            strengthening and capacity building needed time and hands on\n            supervision even with well motivated staff. Many roads in\n            Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) that now are main roads used to\n            be regional roads, and the regional roads used to be local\n            roads, and, consequently, the characteristics of the\n            classified road network are inadequate. The inference is\n            that maintenance alone is insufficient to support economic\n            reorientation and growth and improve traffic safety; the\n            road network structure needs to be reassessed and rebuilt\n            with appropriate standards as the demand for more transport\n            infrastructure is growing. The Traffic Police must be fully\n            involved in traffic safety work. There are about as many\n            accidents in the urban areas as on the inter-city network,\n            together over 70 percent of the total. The elderly are the\n            most vulnerable group, and the most common cause of\n            collisions is speeding. Therefore, safety work needs full\n            cooperation of the police and the road administrations, and\n            needs to be expanded to cover the urban areas. Effective\n            enforcement requires cooperation between the key entities,\n            the establishment of a lead agency, and the preparation of a\n            strategy to guide the comprehensive response involving all stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

There are\n            two main components. The first component finances road\n            maintenance, rehabilitation, and safety improvements for the\n            main and regional road network, including about 280 km of\n            priority road sections in the Federation of Bosnia and\n            Herzegovina, and about 290 km of priority road sections in\n            the Republic of Srpska. The second component finances the\n            institutional strengthening of the two road directorates\n            (FBHRD and RSRD), including setting up of road and bridge\n            data banks, introducing the use of the Highway Development\n            Model (HDM) for setting road maintenance priorities,\n            supervision for civil works, the use of competitive bidding\n            procedures, familiarization with modern road maintenance\n            technologies, improved financial management systems,\n            establishing environmental units in each of the Road\n            Directorates and to support these units in implementing\n            their Environmental Management Plans (EMPs), staff training,\n            and audits of the project accounts. This component also\n            includes a program of technical support for the\n            Bosnia-Herzegovina Road Infrastructure Public Corporation\n            (BRIC), including establishing

environmental adversity resulting from the\n            implementation of the Road Management and Safety Project,\n            and, proposes the following mitigation measures. During\n            construction, it is expected that air, water, and noise\n            pollution will occur : existing asphalt plants, stone\n            quarries, and borrow pits will be used to supply, and\n            materials will be transported, which should be covered,\n            and/or sprayed to prevent dust emissions. Construction\n            activities will be limited to daylight working schedules to\n            control noise disturbances. Traffic disruptions will be\n            minimized by an appropriate traffic management plan, through\n            alternative access routes, and installation of road safety\n            signs. Potential water, and soil pollution from improper\n            disposal of waste materials, and contamination, call for\n            waste disposal at selected sites, including appropriate\n            handling, and storage of oil spills, or lubricants.\n            Destruction of crops, and vegetation will occur : a working\n            zone control will be ensured, as will vegetative\n            propagation. During operation, similar measures will ensure\n            air, water, and noise pollution, with additional protective\n            noise barriers, planting hedges along roadsides, and\n            limiting traffic as possible. Compliance with environmental\n            standards, and health, and safety requirements will be ensured."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Road Management and\n            Safety Project
