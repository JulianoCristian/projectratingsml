The performance of the Bank was fully\n            satisfactory; however, although the Borrower's\n            performance was generally satisfactory, persistent delays\n            occurred, with poor ownership of reforms in many instances.\n            Upon public expenditure discussions, namely trade\n            liberalization, the government's resistance to reform\n            policies did not convey a strong quantitative evidence to\n            support its position. The lessons learned suggest, that\n            although consensus among local stakeholders and external\n            partners existed, with close coordination in principle, it\n            was only the Bank and the International Monetary Fund who\n            pressed for full liberalization of the coffee/cocoa trade.\n            Following the Government's agreement to move ahead, the\n            other donors accepted this reform policy. This successful\n            close cooperation among the various partners, was partly due\n            to staff continuity on both sides. Furthermore, the\n            Bank's flexibility - agreements' release for the\n            second and third tranches - became essential to the overall\n            reform efforts, since disbursements were crucial to meet\n            tight debt schedules. However, monitoring mechanisms should\n            have been established at project inception, to measure the\n            impact of reforms. Likewise, discussion efforts at the\n            community level would have strongly favored the\n            plantations' privatization. Further analytic work would\n            have balanced the state's fiscal interests against\n            those of producers/consumers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Agricultural Sector\n
