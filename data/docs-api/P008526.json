The Project has taught some valuable lessons\n            which concern demand forecasts, tariff and regulatory\n            policies, competition with gas, evaluation of DH systems as\n            whole, and the need to resolve pending liabilities of the\n            beneficiary before the commencement of implementation. 1)\n            Future DH projects should scrutinize demand projections and\n            the factors which affect demand very carefully. Greater\n            efforts to identify new DH consumers should also be\n            undertaken. Demand forecast analysis should also consider\n            the results of social assessments. 2) Appropriate tariff\n            policies play an important role in maintaining DH consumers\n            and thus preserving the viability of DH systems. Maintaining\n            competitiveness with other heat providers should be a prime\n            goal of regulators and incorporated in a DH tariff policy, a\n            clear and consistent regulatory policy based on long-term\n            least-cost provision of heat should be adopted at the\n            beginning of the Project. 3) When designing a DH project, it\n            is important to properly assess risks associated with the\n            potential for competition from gas or other alternatives to\n            DH. 4) The design of DH projects should consider how to\n            optimize the whole DH system within a city, and not just the\n            DH assets owned by a given DH company. 5) The issue of the\n            gas debt should have been more clearly addressed at the\n            project appraisal stage."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia - Jelgava District Heating\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Latvia - Jelgava District Heating\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/12/1047350/latvia-jelgava-district-heating-rehabilitation-project","projn":"LV-Jelgava Dist Heat -- P008526","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Sanitation and Sewerage,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Latvia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01032006473089"},"subsc":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abatement,air\n            pollution,ash,audits,boilers,Carbon,Carbon Dioxide,climate\n            change,coal,commercialization,corrosion,debt,District\n            Heating,district heating system,district heating\n            systems,electricity,emissions,energy charge,energy\n            conservation,energy enterprises,Energy Law,energy\n            savings,Energy Sector,Environmental benefits,environmental\n            improvement,environmental issues,environmental\n            management,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,floods,fuels,greenhouse gases,Heat,heat\n            loss,heat production,heat transfer,heat\n            transmission,Heating,inflation,leakage,leaks,legislation,market\n            prices,nozzles,oil,pipes,pollution,Power,power\n            utilities,pressure,production\n            costs,pumps,Savings,streamlining,temperature,temperature\n            control,tools,transport,waste,water consumption,water\n            quality,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"abatement,air\n            pollution,ash,audits,boilers,Carbon,Carbon Dioxide,climate\n            change,coal,commercialization,corrosion,debt,District\n            Heating,district heating system,district heating\n            systems,electricity,emissions,energy charge,energy\n            conservation,energy enterprises,Energy Law,energy\n            savings,Energy Sector,Environmental benefits,environmental\n            improvement,environmental issues,environmental\n            management,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,floods,fuels,greenhouse gases,Heat,heat\n            loss,heat production,heat transfer,heat\n            transmission,Heating,inflation,leakage,leaks,legislation,market\n            prices,nozzles,oil,pipes,pollution,Power,power\n            utilities,pressure,production\n            costs,pumps,Savings,streamlining,temperature,temperature\n            control,tools,transport,waste,water consumption,water\n            quality,water supply"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF024255-BITS BALTIC-RIGA REGIONAL MISSION,TF023330-SIDA CTF FOR EASTERN EUROPE,TF021836-FINNISH CTF FOR EASTERN &\n            CENTRAL EUROPE,TF021646-DANISH TA/CTF FOR E&C EURO:\n            LATVIA POWER,TF020250-FRENCH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF039410-LATVIA -JELGAVA DISTRICT\n            HEATING REHAB. 2ND PHASE,TF036927-LATVIA - JELGAVA DISTRICT\n            HEATING REHAB.,TF035023-LATVIA - JELGAVA DISTRICT\n            HEATING PROJECT,TF034614-RUSSIA - ENERGY,HOUSING, ST.\n            PETERSBURG REHAB.,TF033292-RUSSIA - HOUSING,GAS DISTR.

The project consists of two\n            components: a) rehabilitation of DH system, through a\n            program to upgrade the system to a variable flow regime;\n            increase boiler efficiency; abate leakages; install heat\n            meters; eliminate environmentally unsound, low-stack\n            coal-fired boilers; and strengthen the maintenance function;\n            and b)
