Some\n            lessons learned included: the project achieved its\n            investment, but it did not achieve its institutional\n            objectives. While overall performance can be judged to be\n            partially satisfactory, given the major institutional\n            shortcomings, the project is not likely to be sustainable.\n            When project objectives depend critically on the performance\n            of public institutions, they should be defined on the basis\n            of comprehensive assessments of the entire major social,\n            political, institutional and economic factors involved. This\n            was not done in the appraisal of the Fourth Power Project.\n            The subsequent Fifth Power Project approved in June 1989\n            also intended to improve EdH's performance and reduce\n            non-technical energy losses, but also without introducing\n            effective changes in the approach used in the previous\n            project to achieve it."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti -
