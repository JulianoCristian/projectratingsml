Faso - Seventh, Eighth, Ninth,\n            Tenth, and Eleventh Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth,\n            Tenth, and Eleventh Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC)\n            Project for Burkina Faso were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned include: budget support\n            can be an effective instrument for governments to finance\n            their development programs and to weather economic shocks. A\n            second lesson is linked to understanding the political\n            economy. Cotton reform was successful because of a positive\n            consensus between the cotton ginning companies, the farmers\n            associations, and the government ministries. A third lesson\n            from the PRSC is the need to be selective and strategic in\n            scope - narrowing the choice and number of policy reforms to\n            support - but ambitious in depth of reforms and their\n            significance for economic growth, employment, and poverty\n            reduction. However, a lesson from policy in Burkina Faso in\n            recent years has been that in the absence of broad-based\n            economic growth and job creation, macro stability and social\n            programs will not on their own have sufficient impact on\n            poverty indicators. A fourth lesson is that more focus needs\n            to be put into statistical capacity-building in order to\n            strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems. A fifth lesson\n            from past lending is the importance of trying to provide\n            finance linked to the government's own budget cycle. A\n            sixth lesson relates to the importance of donor\n            coordination. The experience of Burkina suggests that a\n            well-institutionalized system of donor coordination can\n            facilitate the aid management for the country and ensure\n            better development outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Seventh, Eighth, Ninth,\n            Tenth, and Eleventh Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC)

Support\n            Credit Project (PRSC-8) aims to support the acceleration of\n            real growth and the reduction of poverty incidence in\n            Burkina Faso by supporting action to: (i) improve the\n            investment climate and promote exports; (ii) improve access\n            to basic services through deepened decentralization; and\n            (iii) promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in\n            the use of public resources through enhanced public\n            financial management. The measures supported by the PRSC-8\n            are expected to have a significant positive direct impact on\n            poverty reduction. Specifically, the improvement in the\n            investment climate and the promotion of exports supported by\n            the proposed operation will sustain economic growth. The\n            reforms in public service provision through decentralization\n            will improve access of the poor to education, health, water,\n            and sanitation services, support their greater participation\n            in the growth process and sustain progress towards the\n            Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The strengthening of\n            public financial management is expected to enhance\n            efficiency, transparency and accountability in public\n            resources use. Such measures will also increase the\n            country's absorption capacity for external resources.\n            Burkina Faso continues to be vulnerable to commodity price\n            fluctuation, further increases in oil and food prices could\n            undermine macroeconomic stability and progress made in\n            poverty reduction. High oil prices drain international\n            reserves and increase petrochemical, electricity and\n            transportation costs with adverse impact on the overall\n            economy. Increased world prices on basic food commodities\n            translate into higher inflation and hurt the poor,\n            particularly in urban centers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Eighth
