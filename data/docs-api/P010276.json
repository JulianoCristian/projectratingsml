The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been partially successful, sustainability is\n            uncertain at this time, and the performance of both the Bank\n            and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, considerable savings can\n            be made if the training program is administered by an\n            efficient project management unit instead of external\n            consultants and split-training programs are fostered.\n            Second, greater consideration should be given at appraisal\n            to aspects of institutional consolidation when the NARS is\n            fragmented, salaries are low, and operational costs are\n            scarce. Third, the expectation that the CARP would assume\n            leadership of and credibility among the institutions of the\n            NARS was misplaced. Fourth, a vision statement of the future\n            evolution of the research system should be a precondition\n            for Bank support to a new lending program for agricultural\n            research. Fifth, the contract research program should be\n            continued even though it has been only partially successful.\n            Sixth, the emphasis of the project on human resources\n            development training, strategic provision of equipment, and\n            provision of good housing were important factors in\n            achieving a highly competent and motivated scientific staff.\n            Finally, in the era of tight budgets, NARS will be well\n            advised to establish performance monitors and evaluation systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Agricultural Research Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Agricultural Research Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/06/731894/sri-lanka-agricultural-research-project","projn":"LK-Agric.
