Project and\n            program-related Lessons outline inter-agency cooperation at\n            border cross points, where a cooperative culture should be\n            encouraged and promoted top down by the management of\n            regulatory agencies, making changes in procedures at border\n            crossing points as needed in the future. It is suggested\n            that frequent rotation of staff in the Customs Directorate\n            be avoided, to ensure smooth project implementation, and\n            that Customs control remain under efficient selective\n            procedure. Bank-related Lessons suggest focusing not only on\n            trade facilitation, but on legitimate security requirements,\n            and anti-terrorism aspects, such as a container security\n            code for scanning of cargoes. Further, the Bank should\n            recognize that, when the project involves several innovative\n            reforms, it is expected to have higher risks, but higher\n            rewards as well. Main characteristics of the project were\n            that it was result oriented, with measurable indicators, a\n            unique quality and a major factor which contributed to the\n            success of the project, as well as policy dialogues and\n            cooperation among several border agencies, which deepened\n            the project success. In addition, the regional approach,\n            better results are achieved as opposed to a stand-alone\n            project, for it creates peer pressure among the\n            participating countries, in turn, generates competitiveness\n            and motivation for improved performance. Finally, the\n            contribution of the United States as a parallel financier\n            contributed to the success of the project: the USAID Grant\n            was instrumental in improving public-private partnership,\n            especially in light of the Government's reluctancy to\n            borrow for technical assistance to the private sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Trade and Transport Facilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Trade and Transport\n            Facilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/05/5843300/romania-trade-transport-facilitation-project","projn":"RO-Trade & Transport Facilitation In\n            Southeast Europe Project (Ttf -- P065041","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Trade and Regional Integration,Environmental Economics & Policies,Transport and Trade Logistics,Common Carriers Industry,Trade Policy","teratopic":"Environment,Transport,Industry,International Economics and Trade","count":"Romania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050606103917"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Transport,Industry,International Economics and Trade","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"advisors, advisory services, border\n            crossings, border delays, Cargo, civil service, civil\n            service reform, clearance terminals, commodity, contraband,\n            Customs, Customs Administration, Customs brokers, Customs\n            clearance, Customs Department, Customs duties, Customs\n            officers, customs procedures, domestic legislation, exports,\n            financial capacity, financial resources, foreign investors,\n            foreign trade, Forwarding, free trade, free trade\n            agreements, freight, Freight Forwarders, freight forwarding,\n            harmonization, implementing agencies, imports, Intellectual\n            Property, Intellectual Property Rights, legal frameworks,\n            Legal institutions, manufacturing, neighboring countries,\n            oil prices, partner countries, private sector,\n            privatization, procurement, professionals, public\n            expenditure, public sector, Quality Assurance, reduction in\n            tariffs, regional approach, Regional cooperation, regional\n            coordination, Regional integration, regional level, regional\n            program, Road Transport, supply chain management, technical\n            assistance, Tourism, trade expansion, Trade Facilitation,\n            trade facilitation audits, trade facilitation issues,\n            trading partners, traffic, transaction costs, Transit,\n            Transport Cost, transport costs, transport operators,\n            transport sector, Trucks, waiting time"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF021848-TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION PROJECT IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE,TF024042-BNPP-TRADE: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE,TF030454-AUSTRIA GENERAL CTF FY04 - ECA,TF030461-GREECE CTF FY04 - BALKANS,TF037984-ECA REGION - TRADE AND TRANS.
