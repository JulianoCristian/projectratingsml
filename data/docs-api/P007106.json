Key lessons drawn from the project\n            include: 1) To avoid costly and protracted preparation\n            before starting a social fund, it would be advisable to\n            decide on the institutional framework, establish and staff\n            the implementing agency prior to detailed technical\n            preparation. 2) The use of a poverty-targeting strategy\n            should be strongly encouraged in all programs targeted to\n            benefit poor social groups. 3) Preparation of private\n            contractors can help accelerate subproject preparation as\n            well as implementation. On the other hand, the benefits of\n            rapid implementation must be weighed against the risk of\n            conflict of interest that could compromise subproject\n            selection. 4) Strengthening and improving grassroots\n            organizational capacity to develop subprojects contributes\n            to improve all stages of the subprojects cycle. 5) Training\n            nongovernmental organizations in subproject promotion and\n            development is essential for their full participation in\n            social fund projects. 6) Sustainability will be uncertain if\n            the beneficiaries are not directly involved in monitoring\n            and maintaining their completed subprojects. 7) Continuity\n            of technical staff as well as of external technical\n            assistance contributed to the establishment and maintenance\n            of consistent operating procedures in FISE (Emergency Social\n            Investment Fund), despite turnover of managers caused by\n            political changes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Third Social Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - Third Social\n

unreached by traditional mechanisms. The project will\n            support the government in: (a) establishing an efficient,\n            complementary and demand-driven mechanism for delivering\n            basic services and infrastructure to the poor utilizing\n            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), community\n            organizations and local decentralized agencies; (b)\n            channeling additional resources to social assistance, basic\n            infrastructure and small-scale productive activities; (c)\n            demonstrating transparent and efficient approaches to\n            project selection, management and administration; (d)\n            strengthening the institutional capacity of NGOs and\n            grassroots organizations; and (e) increasing beneficiary\n            participation in poverty alleviation efforts. The project\n            consists of: (a) support for sub-projects approved by FISE\n            in the areas of social infrastructure, socio-economic\n            infrastructure, social services, institutional development,\n            and productive community investments; and (b) institutional\n            support for FISE, including personnel and other operating\n            expenses,
