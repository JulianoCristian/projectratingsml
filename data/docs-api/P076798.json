Some lessons learned included:\n            project design should match the country context and the\n            capacity available in-country. Using a template model that\n            may have worked in other countries creates implementation\n            delays and unrealistic expectations. This applies especially\n            to commitment by all stakeholders, especially Civil Society\n            Organization (CSOs) and to establishing the appropriate\n            institutional framework for program implementation. The\n            project design could have had more of a capacity building\n            and systems development emphasis. Technical and fiduciary\n            teams struggle to cope with responsibilities at inception in\n            a country that is a first time borrower and where\n            collaboration between more than one ministry is key to\n            successful implementation. The capacity to implement\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) must be identified and\n            addressed at the design stage and a budget assigned to it.\n            This is especially important when no baseline data are\n            available and need to be collected within the first year of\n            the project. If that is not possible then proxy data should\n            be used so that performance and outcomes can be measured and\n            monitored. The ability to retain technical and fiduciary\n            staff after project closure is a necessary condition to\n            guarantee operational sustainability. In the case of St.\n            Kitts and Nevis, the skills and experience of trained staff\n            were retained by absorbing the staff in the Government\n            establishment and therefore staff will be available to\n            continue controlling the spread of the HIV and mitigate its impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Kitts and Nevis - HIV/AIDS Prevention\n            and Control

It is important to note that the\n            incidence of biomedical wastes within the framework of the\n            project, poses adverse environmental impacts, due to the\n            inadequate handling of infected materials. This audit of\n            biomedical waste management practices, presents its results,\n            following an assessment based on information, and review of\n            relevant documentation. While some legislation exists, there\n            are no specific regulations at the national level on dealing\n            with biomedical wastes, thus recommendations are made on\n            various elements that could be addressed in future\n            regulations. Short-term recommendations are provided for\n            immediate implementation, as part of a transition to the\n            full implementation of best practices, and a national\n            biomedical waste management system. Containers intended for\n            infectious wastes should bear the international bio-hazard\n            symbol; the UNIVEC safety boxes should be replaced with\n            puncture-resistant sharps containers, with lids to prevent\n            spillage. Such wastes should be transported to a selected\n            central collection point; steps should be taken to phase out\n            incineration practices, though as long as these persist, the\n            area should be kept clean with appropriate chimneys\n            installed, but only infectious waste should be incinerated -\n            toxic metals, chlorine, or chlorinated plastics should NOT\n            be burned. Incineration practices should be banned in the\n            long term, replaced by new efficient treatment technologies.\n            Long term recommendations addresses future legislation, and\n            regulations on biomedical waste management, considering\n            coordination with hazardous (non-biomedical) waste\n            management laws, as well as laws dealing with health, and,\n            establish national and local authorities to enforce such\n            legislation. An institutional policy on biomedical waste\n            management should govern the administrative and\n            organizational structures of health care facilities, to be\n            extended to occupational safety and health issues, waste\n            segregation and classification practices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Kitts and Nevis -
