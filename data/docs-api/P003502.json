Key lessons stress the need for high level\n            government commitments towards both technical progress, and\n            resource mobilization and allocation, to be facilitated\n            through project design, and management arrangements. Such\n            facilitation should also prod the integration of project\n            activities into the routine work programs of local\n            governments, essential in achieving the impact, and\n            sustainability of project achievements. However,\n            projects' fund transfers should be used as incentives\n            for structural reform in health services, and gains in line\n            with national policy, and local needs, rather than\n            prioritizing on health infrastructure investments as many\n            local governments do, hampering the importance of system\n            reform, capacity building, and service quality, and\n            affordability. Moreover, the constraints of human resources\n            in rural health reform remain critical, thus a focused\n            sector work for human resources development is needed,\n            including an adjustment of the roles of public, and private\n            sector. Further improvements are needed in the areas of\n            project financing; policy and planning as part of project\n            design; and, in the uses of technical assistance,\n            procurement of equipment, and, in balancing population\n            coverage with supervisory support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

Rural Health Workers Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The goal of the project is to improve\n            the quality of rural health manpower, thereby contributing\n            to better quality health services and an improved health\n            status of the rural poor in the six provinces. The project\n            has three province-specific components and one central\n            component. The Health Workers Planning component will\n            strengthen the planning capability at the national,\n            provincial and local levels. This component will define the\n            tasks to be done to solve health problems and will identify\n            the demand, the requirements and the utilization for all\n            health worker categories. The Health Workers Training\n            component will retrain large numbers of minimally trained\n            rural health workers, train additional workers for\n            underserved areas, and strengthen the training capability at\n            the provincial, prefectural and county levels. Technical\n            assistance will be provided for developing and implementing\n            community oriented curricula, new teaching and learning\n            methods, teacher training in pedagogy, integration of theory\n            and practice, and evaluation of changes and innovations. The\n            Rural Health Services Management component will improve the\n            working conditions of rural health workers, develop\n            alternative means for mobilizing financial resources to\n            support rural health care delivery, for organizing and\n            managing rural health services, and for compensating and\n            stimulating rural health workers to emphasize preventive\n            care; and provide support systems for supervising these\n            workers effectively. A small Central Component will augment\n            the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Public Health\n            (MOPH) for coordinating and supporting project\n            implementation activities. It will strengthen MOPH's\n            capability to carry out its national mandate in planning and\n            policy formulation, provide technical assistance to the\n            project provinces, and evaluate project activities in order\n            to disseminate the experience gained to the rest of the country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Rural Health Workers Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Rural Health Workers\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/07/734764/china-rural-health-workers-development-project","projn":"CN-Rural Health Manpower (Hlth4) -- P003502","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Regional Rural Development,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Health,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Gender","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961003194417"},"subsc":"Health","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aged,aging,basic health care,Birth\n            Rate,cancer,childbirth,Childhood,clinics,communes,communicable\n            diseases,community health,contraceptives,Death\n            Rate,deaths,doctors,drug consumption,dying,economic\n            development,Expenditures,family\n            planning,gender,glucose,health care,health centers,health\n            clinics,health education,Health Expenditure,health\n            expenditures,Health Financing,Health Manpower,Health\n            Manpower Planning,Health Policies,health policy,health\n            programs,health sector,health services,health status,health\n            system,health training,hospital admissions,hospital\n            beds,hospital\n            costs,hospitals,households,housing,immunization,Infant\n            Mortality,Infant Mortality Rate,infants,infectious\n            diseases,injuries,innovation,inpatient care,inservice\n            training,Life Expectancy,malnutrition,managers,medical\n            care,medical expenses,medical services,medical\n            technology,Medicine,medicines,midwives,mobility,mortality,nurses,Nutrition,occupations,old\n            age,patients,pedagogy,physicians,pregnancy,primary health\n            care,private sector,probability,Professional training,Public\n            Health,Quality of health care,rural areas,rural health\n            care,rural people,rural population,rural\n            women,schools,suicide,supervision,urban areas,Urban\n            Development,Village Health\n            Workers,villages,vitamins,Workers,working conditions"},"1":{"cdata!":"aged,aging,basic health care,Birth\n            Rate,cancer,childbirth,Childhood,clinics,communes,communicable\n            diseases,community health,contraceptives,Death\n            Rate,deaths,doctors,drug consumption,dying,economic\n            development,Expenditures,family\n            planning,gender,glucose,health care,health centers,health\n            clinics,health education,Health Expenditure,health\n            expenditures,Health Financing,Health Manpower,Health\n            Manpower Planning,Health Policies,health policy,health\n            programs,health sector,health services,health status,health\n            system,health training,hospital admissions,hospital\n            beds,hospital\n            costs,hospitals,households,housing,immunization,Infant\n            Mortality,Infant Mortality Rate,infants,infectious\n            diseases,injuries,innovation,inpatient care,inservice\n            training,Life Expectancy,malnutrition,managers,medical\n            care,medical expenses,medical services,medical\n            technology,Medicine,medicines,midwives,mobility,mortality,nurses,Nutrition,occupations,old\n            age,patients,pedagogy,physicians,pregnancy,primary health\n            care,private sector,probability,Professional training,Public\n            Health,Quality of health care,rural areas,rural health\n            care,rural people,rural population,rural\n            women,schools,suicide,supervision,urban areas,Urban\n            Development,Village Health\n            Workers,villages,vitamins,Workers,working conditions"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF033736-CHINA - BASIC HEALTH,TF020761-AUSTRALIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST\n            FUND (USD)","repnb":"11404"},"facets":{}}}
