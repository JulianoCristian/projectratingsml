Some lessons learned included: a proactive\n            approach and flexibility in the Bank and government to adapt\n            to changing circumstances are critical for the success of\n            the project. Problems need to be identified early and\n            measures taken on time to put the project on track. In\n            Adaptable Program Loans, the success of one phase does not\n            necessarily lead to success in the next phase. Changes in\n            the economic situation and level of government commitment\n            arising from the changing circumstances significantly affect\n            project performance. New activities included in the\n            follow-up phase may create additional challenges for\n            implementation. When the project is not moving well and\n            reasonable efforts to fix the situation do not yield\n            results, the Bank and Borrower should be ready to cancel the\n            project when warranted. It is important to have clear and\n            measurable outcome indicators for the project. They need to\n            be systematically monitored to keep the focus on achieving\n            project objectives. Unclear project development objective\n            (PDO) indicators or a lack of focus on outcomes causes\n            underachievement of the project objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan -

- Agricultural insurance\n            feasibility study"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Agriculture is a very important\n            socioeconomic sector in Kazakhstan. The Government of the\n            Republic of Kazakhstan (GRK) introduced a national\n            compulsory crop insurance scheme in 2005 in order to provide\n            grain producers and other farmers with a minimum level of\n            protection against catastrophic climatic events. The overall\n            objective of the current study is to assist the GRK in\n            improving the existing mandatory crop insurance program. The\n            study aims to identify sustainable market-based alternatives\n            to the current crop insurance system in Kazakhstan. In this\n            regard, all of the options for improving the current system\n            that were developed under this study are market based and\n            take into account global experience and the best insurance\n            and reinsurance industry practices for agricultural\n            insurance. The study follows the principles established in\n            the agriculture risk management framework developed by the\n            World Bank. The study focuses mainly on spring wheat crop\n            production in the principal growing regions of Kazakhstan.\n            The study is set out in six chapters. Chapter one gives\n            introduction and objectives of the study. Chapter two\n            presents an overview of agricultural production systems and\n            markets in Kazakhstan, followed by an assessment of the\n            climatic hazards and other risks affecting spring wheat in\n            the country\u0092s main crop areas. Chapter three reviews the\n            structure and performance of the current mandatory crop\n            insurance system in Kazakhstan and identifies a series of\n            institutional, operational, technical, and financial\n            drawbacks of the current system. Chapter four presents a\n            phased strategy and a series of options and recommendations\n            for the GRK to consider for the introduction of market based\n            solutions that aim to strengthen the current scheme. Chapter\n            five explores the opportunities for developing new crop\n            insurance products in Kazakhstan, including prefeasibility\n            analyses for area-yield index insurance (AYII), weather\n            index insurance (WII), and named-peril hail insurance for\n            selected rayons. Finally, chapter six deals with the\n            challenges of tailoring crop insurance to the needs of\n            lower-income smaller farmers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main

The Government of the\n            Republic of Kazakhstan (GRK) introduced a national\n            compulsory crop insurance scheme in 2005 in order to provide\n            grain producers and other farmers with a minimum level of\n            protection against catastrophic climatic events. The overall\n            objective of the current study is to assist the GRK in\n            improving the existing mandatory crop insurance program. The\n            study aims to identify sustainable market-based alternatives\n            to the current crop insurance system in Kazakhstan. In this\n            regard, all of the options for improving the current system\n            that were developed under this study are market based and\n            take into account global experience and the best insurance\n            and reinsurance industry practices for agricultural\n            insurance. The study follows the principles established in\n            the agriculture risk management framework developed by the\n            World Bank. The study focuses mainly on spring wheat crop\n            production in the principal growing regions of Kazakhstan.\n            The study is set out in six chapters. Chapter one gives\n            introduction and objectives of the study. Chapter two\n            presents an overview of agricultural production systems and\n            markets in Kazakhstan, followed by an assessment of the\n            climatic hazards and other risks affecting spring wheat in\n            the country\u0092s main crop areas. Chapter three reviews the\n            structure and performance of the current mandatory crop\n            insurance system in Kazakhstan and identifies a series of\n            institutional, operational, technical, and financial\n            drawbacks of the current system. Chapter four presents a\n            phased strategy and a series of options and recommendations\n            for the GRK to consider for the introduction of market based\n            solutions that aim to strengthen the current scheme. Chapter\n            five explores the opportunities for developing new crop\n            insurance products in Kazakhstan, including prefeasibility\n            analyses for area-yield index insurance (AYII), weather\n            index insurance (WII), and named-peril hail insurance for\n            selected rayons. Finally, chapter six deals with the\n            challenges of tailoring crop insurance to the needs of\n            lower-income smaller farmers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Annexes"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kazakhstan - Agricultural\n            insurance feasibility study (Vol. 2) :
