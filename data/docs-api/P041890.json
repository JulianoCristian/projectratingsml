Lessons\n            learned from the project: A transport strategy endorsed by\n            the city is essential to provide a framework for\n            investments. Political risk is not easy to assess or guard\n            against. Sensitization of key decision makers is crucial for\n            successful implementation of urban transport innovations.\n            Foreign consultants should be selected for tasks for which\n            the Borrower recognizes a clear value added. Traffic\n            management concepts require a process that should involve\n            testing and adaptation before it can be fully implemented or\n            expanded.

The report looks at the following environmental\n            impacts and mitigation: air quality, noise & vibration,\n            surface water pollution, sunshine obstruction, soil &\n            vegetation, social-economic impacts, and resettlement. Major\n            mitigation measures to be undertaken include: construction\n            of sound barriers, and sound absorption pavement;\n            installation of double glazed windows and air conditioners;\n            promotion of public transportation, clean fuels, vehicle\n            inspection, and maintenance programs; installation of street\n            crossing signals, zebra lines, and designated non-motor\n            vehicle lanes; re-plantation and landscaping programs;\n            interception of surface runoff; and establishment of\n            environmental emergency teams to minimize impacts of motor\n            vehicle accidents involving hazardous materials. Remaining\n            noticeable impacts include an increase in noise; loss of\n            agricultural land; temporary traffic obstruction and\n            detouring; and accidental hazardous material release."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Liaoning Urban Transport Project :\n            environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Liaoning Urban Transport\n            Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 5)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/09/441549/china-liaoning-urban-transport-project-environmental-assessment-vol-5","projn":"CN-Liaoning Urban Transport -- P041890","subtopic":"Sanitation and Sewerage,Water and Industry,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Water Conservation","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"China","authors":{"authr":"Post Buckley International, Inc."},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99031911020968"},"subsc":"General transportation sector,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"annual average\n            flow,aquifer,bacteria,benzene,blowers,boilers,Chloride,Clean\n            Water,coal,COD,combustion,Construction,Copper,debris,decision\n            making,discharge,Domestic sewage,drainage,drainage\n            network,drainage system,effluent,effluent\n            discharge,electricity,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            IMPACT ASSESSMENT,Environmental Management,Environmental\n            Monitoring,Environmental Protection,Environmental\n            Quality,evaporation,filtration,fresh\n            water,Gas,hardness,heat,Iron,Land Use,Manganese,mechanical\n            treatment,Meteorology,monsoon climate,Municipal\n            Waste,nitrogen,oil removal,organic pollutants,pH,pipe\n            system,Pollution,Pollution Control,precipitation,production\n            process,PUBLIC PARTICIPATION,Public\n            Utilities,pumping,sanitation,Sewage,Solid Waste,Solid waste\n            storage,solid wastes,Surface Water,Surface Water\n            Quality,trees,Turbidity,washing,washing water,Waste\n            Water,Waste Water Treatment,water body,Water\n            Pollutants,Water Pollution,Water Quality,Water Supply,water\n            table,Water Treatment,Water Treatment Plant,wells,xylene,Zinc"},"1":{"cdata!":"annual average\n            flow,aquifer,bacteria,benzene,blowers,boilers,Chloride,Clean\n            Water,coal,COD,combustion,Construction,Copper,debris,decision\n            making,discharge,Domestic sewage,drainage,drainage\n            network,drainage system,effluent,effluent\n            discharge,electricity,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            IMPACT ASSESSMENT,Environmental Management,Environmental\n            Monitoring,Environmental Protection,Environmental\n            Quality,evaporation,filtration,fresh\n            water,Gas,hardness,heat,Iron,Land Use,Manganese,mechanical\n            treatment,Meteorology,monsoon climate,Municipal\n            Waste,nitrogen,oil removal,organic pollutants,pH,pipe\n            system,Pollution,Pollution Control,precipitation,production\n            process,PUBLIC PARTICIPATION,Public\n            Utilities,pumping,sanitation,Sewage,Solid Waste,Solid waste\n            storage,solid wastes,Surface Water,Surface Water\n            Quality,trees,Turbidity,washing,washing water,Waste\n            Water,Waste Water Treatment,water body,Water\n            Pollutants,Water Pollution,Water Quality,Water Supply,water\n            table,Water Treatment,Water Treatment Plant,wells,xylene,Zinc"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF036204-CHINA - GUANGZHOU CITY CENTRE PROJECT,TF035149-CHINA - LIANING URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT,TF034992-CHINA - TRI PROVINCIAL HIGHWAY PROJECT,TF034791-CHINA - GUANGZHOU CITY CENTER\n            TRANSPORT, LIAONING URBAN TRANSPORT,TF034185-CHINA - LIAONING URBAN\n            TRANSPORT PROJECT,TF025511-PHRD-LIAONING PROVINCIAL URBAN\n            TRANSPORT PROJ.,TF025288-PHRD-GUANGZHOU METRO TRANSPORT (BANK-EXECUTED),TF029447-PHRD-LIAONING PROVINCIAL URBAN TRANSPORT","repnb":"E244"},"facets":{}}}
