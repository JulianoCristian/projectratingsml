Initially, the Bank\n            informed RGC that it would confirm the project restructuring\n            only if the implementing agency could demonstrate concrete\n            progress in preparing the new 230 kV transmission line\n            (notably processing the necessary procurement that would\n            ensure project completion by December 31, 2013). In June\n            2011, Bank management informed Electricite du Cambodge (EDC)\n            that the RGC's request for project\n            restructuring-including the closing date extension and a\n            change in the project development objective to remove\n            reference to Vietnam-could not be processed due to country\n            program conditions. Without the two year extension of the\n            closing date, EDC could not proceed with International\n            Competitive Bidding (ICB) procurement for the supply and\n            installation of the 230 kV line because it could not afford\n            to self-finance the associated works. EDC would also suffer\n            huge financial losses if it did finance the line and then\n            Lao PDR was unable to meet the agreed schedule. Seeing no\n            viable options, RGC requested a full cancellation of the\n            grant for this project on October 4, 2011."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Greater Mekong Subregion Power\n            Trade Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cambodia -

1) Identify and\n            assess environmental impacts associated with transmission\n            lines; 2) Identify design, construction and maintenance\n            measures to avoid or mitigate potential adverse\n            environmental impacts, to be incorporated into the final\n            design; 3) Develop an environmental management plan and\n            associated monitoring plan for project construction and\n            operation; and 4) Assess the organizational capacity of the\n            implementing agency and provide recommendations for\n            enhancement. In addition, the objective of the Detailed\n            Environmental Management plan (DEMP) is to determine the\n            necessary practical mitigation measures for avoiding, and/or\n            minimizing negative impacts caused by the Project. This\n            project has a number of potential negative impacts\n            including: a) Land acquisition; b) Disruption of farming\n            activities and the disturbance of crops, bunds, canals and\n            drains; c) Wildlife will be affected by transmission line\n            construction and operation through the loss of habitat from\n            vegetation clearing; d) Exhaust emissions from machinery\n            used for tower and substation construction will be minor,\n            localized and of short duration; e) soil erosion and water\n            pollution. Different mitigating approaches could be\n            considered for some of the negative impacts, depending on\n            the timing of the Project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Initial Environment

Greater Mekong\n            Sub-region Power Trade Projects is to enhance power trade\n            within Greater Mekong Sub-Region (GMS) with a view to also\n            bringing affordable grid-based electricity to selected\n            provinces in Cambodia through import of power from Lao PDR\n            and Vietnam. Overall, the Project has the following main\n            components: Component 1: Development of cross-border 115 kV\n            Transmission Line linking Lao PDR (Ban Hat) and Cambodia\n            (Stung Treng) to facilitate import of lower cost electricity\n            from Lao PDR to displace higher cost diesel-fueled\n            generation sources in Cambodia; Component 2: Development of\n            cross-border 115 kV Transmission Line linking Vietnam (Tan\n            Bien) and Cambodia (Kampong Cham) for bilateral power\n            exchanges, beginning with imports of lower cost electricity\n            from Vietnam to displace diesel-fueled generation in\n            Cambodia, and leading over the long term to the transfer of\n            surplus hydropower from Cambodia to Vietnam; Component 3:\n            Development of the Xeset 1 to Saravan segment of the\n            proposed 115 kV Transmission Link that would eventually\n            interconnect electricity grids from (western) Thailand\n            through (southern) Laos to (southern) Cambodia; Component 4:\n            Development (feasibility, design, building, commissioning)\n            of a modern Load Dispatch Center (LDC) for Lao PDR to\n            facilitate regional power trade. An LDC, from a regional\n            perspective, is essential for bringing: (i) voltage and\n            frequency control; (ii) system protection and reliability;\n            and (iii) technical information on exchange and dispatching,\n            up to the minimum standards required for security of the\n            grids in neighboring countries that are connected, or will\n            be connected, to Electricite du Laos (EdL's) system. By\n            doing so, development of grid-to-grid interconnections and\n            the security of a future integrated GMS power grid would be\n            enhanced; and Component 5: TA activities in support of: (i)\n            development, through a regional perspective, of feasibility\n            study for hydropower generation for facilitating regional\n            power trade; (ii) consulting services for project\n            implementation; and (iii) consulting services for\n            institutional strengthening."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia and Lao, PDR - Greater Mekong\n            Subregion Power Trade Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cambodia and Lao, PDR - Greater\n            Mekong Subregion Power Trade Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/05/7610901/cambodia-lao-pdr-greater-mekong-subregion-power-trade-projects","projn":"LA-Gms Power Trade (Laos) Project -- P105331,KH-Gms Power Trade (Cambodia) Project -- P105329","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Country Strategy & Performance,Environmental Economics & Policies,Infrastructure Economics,Banks & Banking Reform,Energy Production and Transportation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Energy,Environment","count":"Cambodia,Lao People's Democratic Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070516100154"},"theme":"Infrastructure services for private sector development,Export development and competitiveness,Climate change,Rural services and infrastructure,Regional integration","subsc":"Power,Renewable energy","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Energy,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to electricity, accounting, ADB,\n            Annexes, approach, assistance strategy, audits,\n            availability, bilateral donors, border trade, border\n            transmission, capacity building, capital expenditure, CAS,\n            coal, competitive procurement, complementarities,\n            consumption of electricity, contract negotiations, Credits,\n            debt, debt service, debt service requirements, deficits,\n            diesel, East Europe, economic development, economic\n            efficiency, economic growth, economic integration, economies\n            of scale, Efficiency Improvement, efficient location,\n            electrical power, electricity, electricity consumption,\n            electricity demand, electricity market, electricity prices,\n            electricity systems, electricity tariffs, energy demand,\n            energy resources, energy strategies, energy strategy,\n            Environmental, environmental impacts, Environmental\n            Management, environmental problems, Exchange Rate,\n            exploitation, Financial Analyses, financial arrangements,\n            Financial Management, financial performance, foreign\n            exchange, fossil, fuel, Funds Flow, gas, generation,\n            generation capacity, generators, Grant agreements, human\n            development, hydroelectric power, hydropower, hydropower\n            generation, IDA Credit, import tariffs, imports, Indigenous\n            Peoples, Institutional Development, investments in energy,\n            mineral resources, Mines, missions, national income, net\n            revenues, operating expenses, Pacific Region, payment\n            mechanisms, poverty alleviation, poverty line, POWER, Power\n            Company, power generation, Power Grid, power markets, Power\n            Purchase, Power Purchase Agreements, power sector, power\n            sectors, power system, power systems, POWER TRADE, Present\n            Value, regional economic integration, renewable resources,\n            routes, Rural Electrification, Subsidiary, Sustainable\n            Development, TA, Technical Assistance, transmission\n            interconnection, transmission line, transmission lines,\n            Transmission System, transmission systems, Transport, Trust\n            Funds, utilities, Voltage, water resource management"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE),Southeast Asia Sustainable Dev (EASTS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF030865-DANISH CTF - FY07 (DAC PART I\n            COUNTRIES WITH ANNUAL PER-CAPITA GNP OF L","majtheme":"Rural development,Trade and integration,Environment and natural resource management,Financial and private sector development","repnb":"37455"},"facets":{}}}
