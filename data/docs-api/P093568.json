Some lessons learned included: eligibility\n            constraints and reporting requirements that go beyond what\n            Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs) normally\n            require increases transaction cost of the project, slows\n            implementation, and may have a tendency to shift funds to\n            firms with relatively better access to finance. The\n            application process for sub-loans and leases reportedly\n            required increased efforts compared to normal lending\n            practices but it did contribute to capacity building. It may\n            be better to improve PFIs' existing credit appraisal\n            practices, simplify requirements for smaller sub-loans and\n            borrowers, and require audited sub-borrower data on an\n            annual basis (not quarterly). Offering longer maturities to\n            PFIs could help further deepen financial intermediation by\n            enabling more rollover of funds at PFI level. During the\n            project, loan funds for one bank in the project became\n            unworkable and will not have continued to disburse. Prompt\n            reallocation by Turkish Industrial Development Bank (TSKB)\n            to other PFIs ensured that the overall project was not\n            delayed as a

export\n            growth in Turkey.

TSKB will act in the\n            capacity of a wholesale institution, and will on-lend loan\n            funds through a group of 4-8 private banks, and 2-4 leasing\n            companies, selected pursuant to the criteria agreed between\n            the Borrower and the Bank. TSKB will take the credit risk on\n            the banks and leasing companies selected for participation.\n            The participating financial intermediaries in turn, will\n            make sub-loans and leases to private exporting enterprises\n            for procurement of goods and works, in order to expand their\n            current export volumes, or, in exceptional circumstances, to\n            enable them to retain, and maintain their current level of\n            exports. The on-lending banks and leasing companies will\n            take the credit risks on the borrowing enterprises. The\n            subsidiary loans made by TSKB to the participating banks,\n            and leasing companies will be denominated, and repayable in\n            US Dollars and Euros. The participating banks and leasing\n            companies are expected to price their sub-loans and leases,\n            which may be denominated, and repayable in any foreign\n            currency on a commercial basis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
