Rather than waiting for the perfect environment and\n            for all the elements to be in place, the Bank and the\n            Government of Algeria went forward. One restructuring and\n            one extension later, this proved to be the right decision;\n            2) The downgrading of the project to\n            \"unsatisfactory\" at mid-term review was a good\n            decision to create a momentum and get the project back on\n            track; 3) The personal involvement of the Governor of the\n            Central bank to mobilize relevant people inside the Central\n            Bank and outside demonstrated the importance of a\n            \"Champion\" in the success of a project; 4) The\n            choice of shifting to a more efficient and cheaper\n            technology for the Telecom infrastructure was not easy but\n            at the end was definitely the right one; 5) Lack of\n            specialized staff at the Bank, Algeria-Telecom and the PIU\n            regarding the new technology in Telecom infrastructure\n            caused some delays in the procurement process; 6) The\n            information systems of commercial banks were outside the\n            scope of the project. This is preventing them from fully\n            benefiting from the Real Time Gross Settlement System; 7)\n            Security issues regarding the telecom network should have\n            been addressed at the inception of the project as part of\n            development objectives; and 8) Training issues regarding the\n            new technology used could have been better managed during\n            the implementation of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Financial System Infrastructure\n            Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Financial System\n            Infrastructure Modernization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/03/7592012/algeria-financial-system-infrastructure-modernization-project","projn":"DZ-Financial System Infrastructure\n            Modernization Project -- P054217","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Payment Systems & Infrastructure,Banks & Banking Reform,Technology Industry,Information Technology,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Industry,Information and Communication Technologies","count":"Algeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070509132933"},"subsc":"Banking,Telecommunications,Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Industry,Information and Communication Technologies","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Information and communications","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, Accounting, Auditing,\n            audits, autonomy, Bank Ratings, banking sector, banking\n            system, banks, Basic, cash management, clearing house,\n            Codes, collaboration, commercial banks, Competitive Bidding,\n            Components, Computer hardware, computer networks, computer\n            servers, counterpart, credit transfers, data collection,\n            data transmission, debt, decision-making, deposits, devices,\n            Digital, Direct Participants, Disbursements, electronic\n            payment, electronic payment systems, engineering, equipment,\n            Exchange rate, Financial, financial institutions, Financial\n            Management, financial markets, financial services, foreign\n            banks, foreign entry, funds transfers, Gross Settlement\n            System, information systems, institutional development,\n            Interbank Payments, interfaces, International Accounting\n            Standards, Key performance indicators, knowledge management,\n            large value payments, Learning, liquidity, liquidity risk,\n            Local Area Network, merchant banks, Middle East, net\n            settlement, networks, New technology, nonperforming loans,\n            operating costs, participatory approach, payment\n            instruments, payment system, Payment systems, Payments\n            System, payments systems, private banks, Real Time, Real\n            Time Gross Settlement, recapitalization, regulatory\n            framework, regulatory systems, reorganization, retail\n            banking, risk factors, RTGS, savings, servers, Settlement\n            Systems, Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial\n            Telecommunication, state banks, state enterprises,\n            subsidiary, technical assistance, Telecom Infrastructure,\n            telecom sector, Telecommunication, Telecommunications,\n            Telecommunications Development, telecommunications\n            infrastructure, Telecoms, Telecoms infrastructure,\n            terminals, traceability, workstations"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduct & Econ.
