The lessons learned are distilled from\n            analyzing the project's strengths and weaknesses:\n            Project design proved an effective mechanism to target\n            resources to the community level, and empower local\n            government and communities in the reconstruction and\n            development process. Financing labor-intensive works for\n            short-term job creation was an effective strategy in the\n            immediate post-conflict environment. To ensure better\n            accountability, it is recommended that a more representative\n            range of stakeholders be involved in governing future\n            operations. The institutional capacity of the implementing\n            units needs to be strengthened and new skill areas\n            developed, particularly social, economic, and environmental\n            analysis. Improving local governance should be at the core\n            of any follow-on operation. Greater attention needs to be\n            paid to institution-building and to quality of works and\n            operations and maintenance in future project design. Any\n            future grant financing should be considered within a broader\n            municipal finance framework, and better targeted towards\n            low-income, non-creditworthy municipalities and poor\n            communities. Grants should be performance-based so as to\n            provide incentives for institutional improvements. Greater\n            attention needs to be paid to monitoring and evaluating the\n            impact of investments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia-Herzegovina - Emergency Public Works\n            and Employment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia-Herzegovina -
