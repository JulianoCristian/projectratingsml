This Program aims\n            to establish the conditions for self-sustained growth by\n            progressively withdrawing the State from direct involvement\n            in production and promoting private sector initiative and\n            investment, and achieving greater efficiency of public\n            resource management while restoring internal and external\n            financial equilibria and creditworthiness. It is a logical\n            follow up of the first phase, including measures, some\n            already taken. These measures include (i) increasing the\n            efficiency of public resource management and restoring\n            public savings through an acceleration of the parapublic\n            sector reform, institutionalization of the reform of public\n            investment programming, strengthening of public finances,\n            with particular emphasis on increasing revenues, and\n            improving information management. They further include (ii)\n            extending the reform of incentives to private investment,\n            production and export in agriculture, industry, trade and\n            employment; and (iii) rehabilitating the financial sector,\n            restoring the liquidity of the economy and improving\n            financial intermediation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Third Structural
