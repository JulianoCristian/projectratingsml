Some lessons\n            learned included: clear lines of responsibility and response\n            mechanisms need to be established since the safety of civil\n            works and operations is ultimately a shared risk between\n            government (and its agencies) and the contractor regardless\n            of contract terms. As recognized by METRO (Sao Paulo Metro\n            Company - Companhia do Metropolitano de Sao Paulo),\n            International Tunneling Insurance Group's Code of\n            Practice for risk management of tunnel works should be\n            observed. This considerably reduces risks connected to the\n            design and execution of subterranean works. The Line 4\n            experience confirms that the expropriation process,\n            environmental licensing and advance procurement must be\n            carefully planned from the beginning and executed by the\n            Government to avoid costly delays in project implementation.\n            To the extent foreseeable, potential litigation and\n            potential procedural delays should be factored in\n            implementation time and the procurement process should\n            ensure that the possibility of such litigation is minimized.\n            The bid for the Public-Private Partnership (PPP)\n            concessionaire should have been completed at the time the\n            civil works were bid so that the concessionaire could have\n            actively participated in the implementation of the civil\n            works and possibly requested adaptations to accommodate the\n            equipment it intended to buy. This was the original intent\n            for Line 4 but the PPP law was only approved much later than\n            the start of the civil works and the concession law (which\n            existed at that time) did not allow risk mitigation or\n            operational subsidies. Contracts for concession should be\n            clear about mediation procedures as well as include clauses\n            to allow government to demand proactive measures from the\n            concessionaire to repair defects and indicate measures to be\n            taken in case a defect cannot be immediately repaired."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Sao Paulo Metro Line 4

These\n            stations could not be included in Phase 1 of the project due\n            to the debt limits imposed on the State of Sao Paulo by the\n            Federal Ministry of Finance at the time Phase 1 was\n            launched. The stated main objectives of the Line 4 project\n            were: a) to improve the quality and long-term sustainability\n            of urban transport in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region\n            (SPMR) by interconnecting the existing subway, commuter rail\n            and bus networks through the construction of Metro Line 4;\n            b) to improve the accessibility of the low-income population\n            of the areas served by Line 4 to employment centers and\n            health and education facilities; c) to seek private sector\n            participation in the development of Line 4. The impacts\n            during the implementation of the works are concentrated\n            mainly in areas adjacent to fronts of work, caused by the\n            implementation of traffic diversions; the movement of trucks\n            to transport supplies and exhaustion of surplus material\n            from the excavation of tunnels, causing increased levels of\n            contamination of air and noise, possible temporary\n            relocation of services to the network services, among\n            others. These areas will be affected by the physical changes\n            necessary for the deployment of the work venture, including\n            the expropriation and demolition of urban buildings, the\n            relocation of networks of utilities, among others.
