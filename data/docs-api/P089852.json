Ratings for the\n            Second Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project in Mexico were as follows: outcome\n            was unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Third Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project in Mexico were as follows: outcome\n            was moderately unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory and\n            borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include: the expected outcomes and scope of an\n            operation should be subject to several reality checks at\n            appraisal. An important one is to ensure that essential\n            partners such as INFONAVIT (National Housing Fund for\n            Private Sector Workers) in this case-are fully on board and\n            committed to the operation. If they are not, or cannot be\n            engaged for reasons of political economy, then an\n            operation's scope should be contained to cover the more\n            modest outcomes that can reasonably be obtained without such\n            partners. In large and sophisticated middle-income countries\n            like Mexico, an operation should avoid promising sector-wide\n            reforms when commensurate results cannot be realistically\n            achieved in the short timeframe and with the relatively\n            modest scale of assistance offered. Operations aiming to\n            support affordable housing and urban poverty reduction need\n            to be explicit about their target beneficiary populations,\n            with quantification of baselines and targets, and at\n            completion, achievements. Contrary to down-market aims,\n            establishing a sound reputation in financial markets and\n            sustaining a high quality and expanding portfolio can lead a\n            new mortgage financier up-market, by targeting higher income\n            borrowers with larger loans. Markets perceive such loans as\n            less risky. They are also less costly to manage and\n            contribute more to business growth."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - FOVI Restructuring Project,\n            Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty

Ratings\n            for the Second and Third Programmatic Affordable Housing and\n            Urban Poverty Development Policy Loan Projects for Mexico\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            a policy-based loan is not the best instrument to address\n            technical issues requiring considerable investment and which\n            are not backed by an adequate policy framework. Instead, a\n            combination of policy and investment loans might have been\n            more effective in meeting the Program's goals.\n            Inefficiencies and redundancies were produced due to the\n            involvement of too many institutions, which were often at\n            odds with each other over policy issues. This was largely\n            due to the large number of components and sectors under the\n            umbrella of the Program. A more focused approach, as\n            previously mentioned, could have reduced these\n            inefficiencies and redundancies. The comprehensive nature of\n            the Program required that adequate Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) provisions be written into the design of the\n            operation; however this was not done until preparation of\n            the second operation was well advanced. Housing and Urban\n            Technical Assistance Loan (HUTAL) should have played a role\n            in fixing the shortcomings of the Program and its\n            implementing institutions in this area. The timing of HUTAL\n            should have been better aligned with the Program in order to\n            provide added value to each component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Affordable Housing and

Development and Territorial Planning\n            Program 2001-2006. (See report no. 27627 (PGD)) The overall\n            program of World Bank support includes three sector\n            adjustment and development policy loans and a US$7.7 million\n            Housing and Urban Technical Assistance Loan. The program\n            supports the Government's efforts to improve national\n            policies and institutions for housing and urban development;\n            make the federal housing system more efficient by designing\n            and implementing a unified system of subsidies to facilitate\n            access to housing by low- and moderate-income families;\n            bolster systems for housing loans and savings and move them\n            down-market; strengthen urban real property registries and\n            rights; coordinate and support physical and social\n            investments in poor neighborhoods; increase the supply of\n            and access to urban land for poor people and improve this\n            market's functioning; and increase capacity to prevent\n            and manage the damage caused by natural disasters. This\n            second loan in the series provides continued support for the\n            Government's program, which has made strong progress\n            towards its outlined goals. In particular, HUDPL-II will\n            support five main areas: 1) Reforming the operation and\n            structure of federal housing subsidies. 2) Developing new\n            financing mechanisms for home purchases, improvements, and\n            additions for low- and moderate-income populations. 3)\n            Expanding the program for modernizing property registries.\n            4) Strengthening the slum upgrading program. 5) Expanding\n            low- and moderate-income land development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
