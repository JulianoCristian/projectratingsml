The main objectives were as\n            follows: (a) improved agricultural services by strengthening\n            selected agricultural institutions in the project area; (b)\n            increased availability of farm inputs; (c) improved water\n            supply and road infrastructure; and (d) improved crop\n            production technology.  Bank's performance was not\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was not\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            attempts to implement a project under insecure conditions\n            are likely to result in a squandering of resources for\n            meagre results; (ii) an integrated approach to development\n            should not mean that all directions should be pursued\n            simultaneously; (iii) the broad strategy needed to structure\n            project activities should be defined before implementation\n            and be shared by the major actors; (iv) a project should be\n            implemented through existing line agencies; and (v) full\n            cost recovery for water yards appears too heavy for the\n            resources of most farmers in the project area."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan -
