Both the World Bank and Borrower performances are\n            rated as satisfactory. The lessons learned include the\n            following: Establishing a partnership between the\n            Government, municipalities, and the private sector in order\n            to develop appropriate solutions to public transport issues\n            in a big metropolitan area is an excellent approach.\n            However, considerable efforts are required to initiate and\n            nurture such an innovative process. Second, it is important\n            to promise only what can be effectively delivered;\n            performance indicators should have been revised following\n            the scaling down of the project. Third, it is not enough to\n            expect stakeholders to make voluntary contributions to a\n            development fund, even if they are part of the\n            decision-making process. Fourth, privatization of a public\n            bus company is extremely difficult; liquedation is not an\n            option because of pressures from powerful groups and the\n            problems resulting from a vastly increased urban congestion.\n            Fifth, while it makes senses to focus on establishing an\n            adequate institutional framework before initiating a large\n            investment program, there is a risk that stakeholders may be\n            demobilized by delaying much-needed investment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Urban Transport Reform and\n
