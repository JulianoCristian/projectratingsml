Some\n            lessons learned included: ICT community centers created\n            bottom up on the basis of demand by community organizations\n            are a sturdy and promising model for bridging the\n            connectivity gap in Ethiopia and probably in other\n            countries. None of the 65 centers created under the ICTAD\n            project have folded down, even those that have operated for\n            over two years. This is an important lesson when considering\n            that failure rates during this same period exceed 15 percent\n            in other countries. Since this project did not have time to\n            determine unequivocally whether the business model used was\n            financially sustainable and therefore scalable in the\n            long-run, a clear lesson is also the need to test desirable\n            modifications to the business model and financial\n            sustainability over a longer period. Agreements between\n            government agencies, particularly across levels of\n            government, can go wrong for many reasons. When detailed\n            commitments of staff, time, money, authority, problem\n            solving, monitoring, early termination, etc. are not spelled\n            out at entry, as in the case of ICTAD, the risk of\n            implementation failure can be increased. This is of course a\n            dilemma for project preparation which will need to be\n            extended in time (and cost) to achieve this level of\n            precision. It is also a risk in itself as best laid plans\n            can be unraveled during implementation or unduly constrain\n            it. However, if the partnerships are critical success\n            factors for the project, this problem has to be addressed\n            either through extended project preparation, more flexible\n            results frameworks or more flexible staffing plans. Bank\n            project team continuity is important success factor that\n            should be the default Bank staffing policy. When\n            International Development Association (IDA) to change\n            ICTAD's Task Team Leader following mid-term review\n            (MTR), Government of Ethiopia (GoE) argued forcefully\n            against it and IDA's eventual agreement to keep the\n            team intact from beginning to end of the project proved to\n            be decisively important."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Information and Communication\n            Technology Assisted Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Information and\n

The\n            project consists of two components: 1) Policy and\n            Institutional Support: This component will establish an\n            enabling environment for the growth of the ICT sector by\n            supporting a comprehensive assessment of the existing\n            policy, regulatory and legal framework, particularly in the\n            areas of information technology, telecom, information\n            sharing, and internet. It will also strengthen capacity of\n            the key institutions that regulate the sector, provide\n            services, or manage the reform process. 2) Application and\n            Community Support: An important objective of the\n            Government's ICT development program is to increase\n            connectivity and to provide access to communications\n            services throughout the country. International experience\n            suggests that the expansion of communications network is\n            strongly correlated with economic growth, and that access to\n            communications in rural areas diminishes the urban/rural\n            economic disparities, provides access to market information,\n            and facilitates service delivery in health, education and\n            other areas thereby reinforcing the poverty reduction\n            contribution of ICTs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Information and Communication\n            Technology Assisted Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Information and\n            Communication Technology Assisted Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/08/5069559/ethiopia-information-communication-technology-assisted-development-project","projn":"ET-Ict Assisted Dev Sim (Fy05) -- P078458","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Knowledge Economy,Health Economics & Finance,Education for the Knowledge Economy,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Education","count":"Ethiopia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040830101807"},"subsc":"General education sector,Health,General public administration sector,General information and communications sector,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Information and communications,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to\n            internet,adaptation,Broadcasting,communication\n            services,Communication Technologies,Communication\n            Technology,communications infrastructure,Competitive\n            Bidding,content\n            development,education,goods,health,ICT,information,information\n            technology,intermediaries,internet,internet access,Internet\n            Service Providers,knowledge,knowledge economy,knowledge\n            sharing,learning,licensing,life\n            expectancy,literacy,mortality,network\n            infrastructure,Partnership,private sector,programs,Public\n            Sector,Radio,regulatory framework,Rural Connectivity,service\n            delivery,taxation,telecommunication,telecommunication\n            services,Telecommunications,Telecommunications\n            sector,telecommunications services"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to\n            internet,adaptation,Broadcasting,communication\n            services,Communication Technologies,Communication\n            Technology,communications infrastructure,Competitive\n            Bidding,content\n            development,education,goods,health,ICT,information,information\n            technology,intermediaries,internet,internet access,Internet\n            Service Providers,knowledge,knowledge economy,knowledge\n            sharing,learning,licensing,life\n            expectancy,literacy,mortality,network\n            infrastructure,Partnership,private sector,programs,Public\n            Sector,Radio,regulatory framework,Rural Connectivity,service\n            delivery,taxation,telecommunication,telecommunication\n            services,Telecommunications,Telecommunications\n            sector,telecommunications services"}},"owner":"AFTOS: Dev.
