Ratings for the Biodiversity\n            Conservation Project (ABC) for Argentina were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: The Bank should encourage natural resource project\n            managers to take advantage of rapidly changing advances in\n            biodiversity conservation methods and tools to complement\n            traditional on-the-ground monitoring of indicator species\n            surveys. These include satellite imagery and aerial\n            photographs of habitat vegetation cover, or real-time remote\n            monitoring devices and camera traps when conservation of\n            specific species is the objective. Blending different\n            lending instruments, such as International Bank of\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loans with Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF) grants, to achieve different\n            natural resource management objectives can be an effective\n            way to engage clients in addressing the full range of sector\n            challenges they face. For example, the decision to use an\n            IBRD loan to help Argentina increase park system revenues\n            under the NFPA Project while preserving ecoregions of global\n            significance under the ABC Project justified the use of a\n            GEF grant. When experimenting with new techniques or\n            approaches to land-use practices or natural resource\n            management, it is best to approach experimental\n            interventions in a measured way assuming that unexpected\n            difficulties, costs, and delays will inevitably arise. The\n            NFPA Project conducted applied research projects on\n            compatible land-use practices in productive landscapes while\n            the ABC Project introduced alternative, less destructive\n            productive activities in park buffer zones."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Native Forests and Protected\n            Areas Project; Argentina - Biodiversity Conservation

Some lessons\n            learned included: development is not a linear process, and\n            processes need to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to\n            changes on the ground. Although the project experienced some\n            setbacks, including delays and difficulties during\n            implementation, it managed to produce highly relevant\n            impacts for the protected area sector by closing. The Bank,\n            as an institution, should ensure that its instruments,\n            philosophy and approaches to development are flexible enough\n            to adapt to the changing country conditions, while\n            maintaining focus on the project development objective. The\n            creation of a protected area is a complex process that\n            involves diverse actors and requires substantial\n            coordination. In future projects, sufficient time should be\n            allocated according to the complexity of participatory\n            processed and taking into account the number of actors and\n            decision makers involved. This is especially important in\n            situations where a diverse spectrum of stakeholders are\n            concerned (private land holders, intermediary agents,\n            stakeholders,

diversifying the existing National Protected\n            Areas System, and b) sustaining their management by\n            institutional strengthening, public consultation and\n            participation, and improving information management. As\n            such, the project comprises 3 components: protected areas\n            (PA); information management; and management, monitoring,\n            and evaluation. The Protected Areas component consists of\n            three sub-components: a) establishing and consolidating new\n            PAs; b) sustainable development activities in PA buffer\n            zones; and c) activities to enhance public participation in\n            park planning and management. Under these 3 sub-components,\n            (1) national parks are built at five national PAs in poorly\n            represented ecosystems; and technical assistance, limited\n            equipment, and small works are provided; (2) improved\n            community land use practices are supported through pilot\n            projects, extension activities, and public awareness\n            activities; and (3) a participation plan and a mitigation\n            plan are implemented to encourage broad support and to\n            alleviate social costs. The Biodiversity Information\n            Management component puts in place an internet-based network\n            that provides training and needed standards, finances system\n            development, acquires hardware, and reconfigures existing\n            databases.
