The project aimed to support the\n            development of SMIs in the private sector through financial\n            and technical assistance. Industrial Development Bank of\n            Egypt(IDBE), which is fully owned by the Government of Egypt\n            (GOE), has been serving as a development finance institution\n            (DFI) to promote and finance particularly the development of\n            small and medium industries (SMIs) in the private sector.\n            The Project, even though substantially delayed, was able to\n            help improve the operations of IDBE from the state they were\n            in when the loan was made in the mid-1980s. One important\n            lesson learned in this project is the success of a DFI\n            operation depends to a significant extent on the financial\n            intermediary strengthening its capability for project\n            appraisal, supervision, and follow-up with adequate\n            provision for training. The Bank has indicated that it would\n            be willing to consider providing funds under an apex loan in\n            the future if IDBE is restructured by allowing equity\n            participation by private investors, enabling it to function\n            as an independent entity. IDBE is also considering the\n            option of raising funds by issuing bond."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Small and Medium Scale Industry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt -
