The Banks\u0092\n            performance is considered satisfactory while the Borrower\u0092s\n            performance is considered unsatisfactory. The project\n            encountered a large number of difficulties and issues which\n            hampered project implementation. In addition to the security\n            conditions which have progressively worsened during the last\n            two years of the project, weak central and regional\n            institutions and the lack of sound sectoral policies were\n            the main constraints, not only at the level of the technical\n            ministries in charge of the project but also at the level of\n            the Ministry of Finance. Lessons learned from this project\n            include: (a) the change of OPIs statutes into EPIC's\n            (Etablissements Publics a caractere Industriel et\n            Commercial) should have been more closely monitored by the\n            Bank; (b) water tariff adjustment should have been a\n            condition of loan effectiveness; (c) key indicators for\n            project implementation should have been followed up by the\n            Government and the Bank; greater care should have been given\n            to the monitoring system to be put in place for the project;\n            (d) the Bank should endeavor to agree on an authorized\n            allocation deposited in the special account commensurate\n            with the actual project financial needs. (e) a time-gap with\n            the structural adjustment process negatively affected the\n            project particular factors: shortage of foreign currency,\n            shortage of construction materials, deficiency in the\n            banking sector delaying creditors payments, cumbersome\n            administrative procedures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Cheliff Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Cheliff Irrigation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/09/733709/algeria-cheliff-irrigation-project","projn":"DZ-Irrigation Chelif I -- P004913","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Irrigation and Drainage,Water Use,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Sanitation and Sewerage,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Algeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!107234"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!107234"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!107234"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961008064828"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"AfDB,agricultural\n            production,audits,construction,cost of water,costs of\n            irrigation infrastructure,cropping,cropping\n            patterns,crops,Drainage,FAO,farmers,Forests,groundwater,horticultural\n            products,Hydraulics,iron,irrigated\n            agriculture,Irrigation,irrigation development,irrigation\n            equipment,irrigation infrastructure,Irrigation\n            Management,irrigation operations,Irrigation\n            Project,irrigation sector,irrigation system,irrigation\n            systems,irrigation water,Large Scale Irrigation,Natural\n            Resources,plantations,pumping stations,PVC,reservoirs,river\n            basin,rivers,Rural Development,rural roads,soils,spare\n            parts,sprinkler irrigation,Structural Adjustment,surface\n            irrigation,tanks,trees,use of irrigation,water charges,water\n            distribution,water fees,water management,water tariff,water tariffs,wheat"},"1":{"cdata!":"AfDB,agricultural\n            production,audits,construction,cost of water,costs of\n            irrigation infrastructure,cropping,cropping\n            patterns,crops,Drainage,FAO,farmers,Forests,groundwater,horticultural\n            products,Hydraulics,iron,irrigated\n            agriculture,Irrigation,irrigation development,irrigation\n            equipment,irrigation infrastructure,Irrigation\n            Management,irrigation operations,Irrigation\n            Project,irrigation sector,irrigation system,irrigation\n            systems,irrigation water,Large Scale Irrigation,Natural\n            Resources,plantations,pumping stations,PVC,reservoirs,river\n            basin,rivers,Rural Development,rural roads,soils,spare\n            parts,sprinkler irrigation,Structural Adjustment,surface\n            irrigation,tanks,trees,use of irrigation,water charges,water\n            distribution,water fees,water management,water tariff,water tariffs,wheat"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa"}},"repnb":"15019"},"739684":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1987/04/739684/algeria-cheliff-irrigation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1987/04/739684/algeria-cheliff-irrigation-project","new_url":"1987/04/739684/algeria-cheliff-irrigation-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1987/04/17/000009265_3960926051328/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1987/04/17/000009265_3960926051328/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2809","datestored":"1987-04-17T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1987-04-17T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Cheliff Irrigation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Cheliff Irrigation Project hopes to\n            accomplish several objectives in the irrigation subsector at\n            the local level, the sector level and also the national\n            level.
