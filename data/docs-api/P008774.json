Industrial Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The outcome of the Industrial\n            Development Project is rated as satisfactory, sustainability\n            as likely, institutional development impact as modest, bank\n            performance as satisfactory, and borrower performance as\n            satisfactory. The implementation experience of the project\n            offers several valuable lessons. 1) Initiatives with\n            objectives targeted on capacity building for the financial\n            sector and financial intermediation have a better chance of\n            success if conditioned upon macroeconomic stability and\n            sustained government support. 2) The success of financial\n            intermediary loans is dependent upon a disciplined credit\n            environment. It is essential that banks are sufficiently\n            trained in governance, management, financial policies,\n            credit and risk management. The inclusion of appropriate\n            banking sector prudential guidelines is necessary so that\n            participating financial institutions (PFIs) are strengthened\n            rather than undermined by their participation in similar\n            projects. 3) An apex arrangement functions best if the apex\n            institutions is housed in a more permanent,\n            commercially-oriented entity, which does not compete with\n            the PFIs and is motivated by incentives. 4) In implementing\n            financial intermediary loans, demonstrating flexibility to\n            market changes and adaptability toward small and medium\n            scale enterprises as important economic agents, increases\n            the impact of the project and its responsiveness to the\n            country's conditions and the Government's\n            development objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Industrial Development
