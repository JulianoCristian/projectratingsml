Except for the service delivery component,\n            the sustainability of activities for institutional\n            development, community partnership, and operations research\n            is unlikely. Bank performance improved from 1998, when\n            supervision was handed over to the resident mission, and a\n            new task manager developed a more productive working\n            relationship, and assisted with the project restructuring.\n            By this time also, the resident mission had developed a\n            capacity to assist the health department with training and\n            technical assistance. But despite these improvements later\n            in project implementation, overall Bank performance is rated\n            as unsatisfactory. Borrower performance also is rated\n            unsatisfactory overall. Nevertheless it was far better in\n            its last two years than in its first four, mainly because a\n            full-time project manager wa sappointed, project\n            restructuring helped the project management office get some\n            of the basic planning done, and progress was made in\n            strengthening capacity and clarifying procedures. Lessons\n            learned included the need to resolve cross-cutting and\n            fundamental management problems first; identify and respond\n            to major changes likely to affect the implementing agency;\n            encourage the Borrower to maintain a professional project\n            management office; and create true project ownership; and\n            for task manager continuity, supervision in the crucial\n            first project year, replacement of ineffective task managers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -
