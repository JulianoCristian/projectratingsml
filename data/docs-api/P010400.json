Although the physical components were\n            completed, ahead of time and under budget, results were\n            mixed. The developmental strengthening of the Maharashtra\n            State Electricity Board was marginal, unlikely to be\n            sustained. Nevertheless, the project ensured the need for\n            power sector restructuring, even though timing remains\n            questionable. The key lessons drawn from this project,\n            suggest that while state governments in India, exercise the\n            operational control of the state electricity boards (SEBs),\n            commercial decisions are not under the latter's\n            control, hence a detrimental financial and commercial burden\n            exists. Unless a private majority ownership takes control,\n            revenues will continue to be unaccounted for. Project\n            results confirm the position taken by the Bank, with respect\n            to the power sector in the region, because despite previous\n            attempts, the only sustainable solution remains to address\n            the root of the problem, i.e., the politicization of\n            decisions, non-technical losses due to theft, and, lack of a\n            commercial culture, attainable only through structuring of\n            the power sector at the national level. This would include\n            corporatization, regulatory framework development, and\n            tariff reforms, including privatization development.\n            However, resettlement and rehabilitation plans were\n            achieved; its success, attributed to self-relocation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
