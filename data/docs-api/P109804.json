Some lessons learned\n            includes: ensure government involvement throughout the\n            entire project life-cycle: (i) define clear parameters for\n            government involvement and coordination, which should\n            encompass frequent progress reviews, joint site visits and\n            government capacity-building activities; (ii) engage all\n            levels of governments, from national and provincial levels\n            to district, sub district and village levels; (iii) involve\n            sector departments with expertise that meets the needs of\n            the target groups. Early involvement of these departments is\n            a prerequisite for responsibilities to be transferable at\n            project closing; (iv) conduct needs-assessments jointly with\n            the government to establish priority needs, sectors and\n            assistance strategies; and (v) ensure that sufficient\n            internal staffing and funding resources are allocated to\n            government engagement activities, which at a minimum should\n            include one senior staff member assigned to government\n            engagement. Establish a robust information management,\n            monitoring, evaluation and reporting system: (i) ensure\n            high-quality and timely report submission in the local\n            language, targeting all relevant government institutions at\n            national, provincial and local levels; (ii) make provisions\n            for brief monthly reports in addition to in-depth quarterly\n            reports. Accessibility and readability of such reports were\n            viewed as critical by the recipient institutions; (iii)\n            establish a dedicated information management and Monitoring\n            and Evaluation (M and E) team within the project with\n            adequate expertise in data analysis, mapping software and\n            monitoring and evaluation tools; and (iv) give the\n            government a role in progress monitoring through reporting,\n            implementation reviews and joint site visits. Build in\n            flexibility in project design/components: (i) ensure\n            flexible definition of project components and budgeting for\n            a demand- and needs-oriented project implementation that\n            enables the team to quickly respond to diverse and specific\n            needs of the target groups and unexpected challenges; and\n            (ii) allow for timely adjustment of project design when\n            needed, in close consultation with the donors, government\n            and other stakeholders. Effective implementing agency: a\n            well-functioning implementation agency, staffed with\n            competent and committed people who should be fairly\n            remunerated is essential for a successful implementation of\n            a multi-component and complex project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Access to Finance and Capacity\n            Building for

There are six\n            components to the project. The first component of the\n            project is assessment for identification of\n            interventions/targeting beneficiaries. Under this component\n            the International Organization for Migration (IOM) will\n            conduct livelihood, market and environmental surveys in\n            order to fine-tune the implementation strategy for\n            assistance to Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs). The second\n            component of the project is asset replacement. Under this\n            component, IOM will purchase goods and provide them as in\n            kind support to restore infrastructure and physical assets\n            that are essential for operations of MSEs, such as\n            production facilities, livelihood tools, irrigation systems,\n            small roads, warehouses, sheds, pens, and other essential\n            small-scale infrastructure. The third component of the\n            project is access to finance. Under this component, small\n            loans will be provided to MSEs, including community\n            enterprises, associations, cooperatives, etc. The fourth\n            component of the project is assistance for market access.\n            Under this component the project will finance Technical\n            Assistance (TA) to help MSEs recover former buyers and\n            customers or to identify new ones. The fifth component of\n            the project is capacity building technical assistance. Under\n            this component, the project will invest in TA and training\n            for skills development and capacity building for the MSEs.\n            Training envisaged under this component includes\n            entrepreneurial skills such as financial management and\n            marketing and business plan development. The six component\n            of the project is project management and monitoring and\n            evaluation.
