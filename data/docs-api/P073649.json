Some lessons learned included:\n            With the completion of HSPSP-II's support to\n            Ghana's health sector-wide approach (SWAp), reflection\n            on its achievements as well as weaknesses reveals several\n            lessons. One lesson is that a stronger analytic base is\n            needed even when things appear to be going well, as was the\n            case when the HSPSP-II was approved. In-depth analysis and\n            debate concerning equity of health services and outcomes,\n            efficiency of health services, and institutional analyses\n            would have been particularly helpful in anticipating\n            problems and furthering the agenda set by the program of\n            work (POW-II) and the Ghana poverty reduction strategy\n            (GPRS). It is also clear that donor behavior is critical to\n            the success or failure of a SWAp. Donors need to be\n            disciplined about their funding support to a sector and hold\n            other donors accountable for their actions. Donors can\n            easily revert back to earmarked, off-budget funding that\n            compromises the Government's attention to the\n            SWAp's implementation and success, while tempting other\n            donors to follow suit and push for their own agendas as\n            well. Other development partners moved towards budget\n            support, which can also cause disruptions at the sectoral\n            level. Safeguards should be instituted to ensure that shifts\n            to general budget support are upheld by processes to ensure\n            a smooth transition in financing modalities. Donor shifts to\n            budget support are in line with the Paris declaration;\n            however, countries need to be ready for this transition\n            ahead of time to ensure that the predictability of funds is\n            not interrupted."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Second Health Program Support\n            Project (HSPSP-II)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Second

For the Second POW, a broader\n            definition of the health sector has been adopted to include\n            government health services, traditional and non-government\n            providrs, civil society, and community groups. The objective\n            for the period 2002-2006 is to continue to improve the\n            health status of the population while focusing efforts on\n            reducing inequalities in health. Furthermore, the Ghana\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) outlines the following key\n            objectives for 2002-2004: 1) Bridge the equity gap in access\n            to quality health and nutrition services; 2) Ensure\n            sustainable financing arrangements that protect the poor and\n            3) Enhance efficiency in service delivery. This project\n            specifically supports the Government in achieving the\n            abovementioned objective and supports the Ministry of Health\n            in implementing its 2002-2006 POW through financing a\n            portion of the combined Government and external assistance\n            budgets for policy development and operational program\n            activities. The Ministry of Health will focus on ten areas:\n            1) strengthening priority health interventions; 2)\n            developing human resources for health services; 3) enhancing\n            infrastructure and support services; 4) fostering\n            partnerships for health; 5) improving regulation; 6)\n            reforming organizational arrangements; 7) improving health\n            sector financing; 8) improving financial management systems;\n            9) further strengthening management information systems and\n            performance monitoring; and 10) linking with traditional medicine."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

The constructional phase will\n            be characterized by transfer and prefabricated materials,\n            equipment/machinery, and transport of workers to the site.\n            These activities will affect the already heavy vehicular\n            traffic, and pose accident risks resulting from occupational\n            hazards as well. Transport of soils and materials will\n            generate dust. Heavy construction vehicles and equipment may\n            generate noise. Solid waste in the form of debris and\n            topsoil will be carried off to sites. As the site is cleared\n            in preparation for construction, there will be loss of fauna\n            and flora. During the occupational phase, potential hazards\n            would be posed by exposure to hazardous health care waste.\n            Hazardous waste comprises infectious agents, hazardous\n            chemicals like disinfectants or obsolete pesticides, and\n            pharmaceuticals, genotoxic waste such as cytotoxic drugs,\n            radioactive materials, and sharps. There is a particular\n            concern that infection with immunodeficiency virus (HIV),\n            and hepatitis B and C could be transmitted through health\n            care waste, that is, injuries from syringes contaminated by\n            human blood or through secretions. After weighing various\n            options, the report concludes that the best disposal methods\n            for treated health care waste are controlled disposal at a\n            proper sanitary landfill and burial in cemeteries or a\n            crematorium.

Full\n            compensation will cover the loss of structures or income\n            during the period the affected person could not reap any\n            income, or the structure will be relocated to an acceptable\n            site. Loss of standing crops and livestock will be fully\n            compensated. Compensation paid for loss trees and plants\n            will depend on tree type, age, and diameter and/or\n            equivalent land will be given for replanting."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Second Health Sector Program Support\n            Center Project : resettlement policy framework"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Second Health Sector\n            Program Support Center Project : resettlement policy framework"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/09/2061534/ghana-second-health-sector-program-support-center-project-resettlement-policy-framework","projn":"GH-Second Health Sector Program Support\n            Project -- P073649","docty":"Resettlement Plan","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Voluntary and Involuntary Resettlement,Urban Housing,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Ghana","authors":{"authr":"Ministry of Health, Ghana"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02112004013174"},"subsc":"Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to land,agricultural products,arable\n            land,building materials,burial\n            sites,communities,COMPENSATION,compensation\n            procedures,Construction,crops,cultural survival,development\n            projects,diseases,displacement,eminent\n            domain,employment,ENTITLEMENTS,environmental\n            impacts,environmental issues,Environmental Protection,ethnic\n            minorities,evacuation,Farmers,fishing,forest\n            products,gender,health\n            services,housing,impoverishment,impoverishment\n            risks,income,Income restoration,indigenous\n            peoples,inventory,involuntary resettlement,Land\n            Acquisition,land compensation,land owner,LAND\n            OWNERSHIP,LAWS,LEGAL\n            FRAMEWORK,legislation,livelihoods,livestock,loss of\n            income,market value,mitigation,natural resources,Operational\n            Policies,poverty line,private land,project areas,property\n            owners,property rights,resettlement,resettlement\n            activities,resettlement assistance,resettlement\n            evaluation,resettlement policy,resettlement\n            programs,resettlement sites,resettlement\n            strategies,resettlers,rural areas,social analysis,social\n            impacts,social networks,Squatters,sustainable\n            development,vulnerable groups"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to land,agricultural products,arable\n            land,building materials,burial\n            sites,communities,COMPENSATION,compensation\n            procedures,Construction,crops,cultural survival,development\n            projects,diseases,displacement,eminent\n            domain,employment,ENTITLEMENTS,environmental\n            impacts,environmental issues,Environmental Protection,ethnic\n            minorities,evacuation,Farmers,fishing,forest\n            products,gender,health\n            services,housing,impoverishment,impoverishment\n            risks,income,Income restoration,indigenous\n            peoples,inventory,involuntary resettlement,Land\n            Acquisition,land compensation,land owner,LAND\n            OWNERSHIP,LAWS,LEGAL\n            FRAMEWORK,legislation,livelihoods,livestock,loss of\n            income,market value,mitigation,natural resources,Operational\n            Policies,poverty line,private land,project areas,property\n            owners,property rights,resettlement,resettlement\n            activities,resettlement assistance,resettlement\n            evaluation,resettlement policy,resettlement\n            programs,resettlement sites,resettlement\n            strategies,resettlers,rural areas,social analysis,social\n            impacts,social networks,Squatters,sustainable\n            development,vulnerable groups"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 2 (AFTH2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"RP119"},"facets":{}}}
