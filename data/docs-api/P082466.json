Some lessons\n            learned included: national mass transit program needs to\n            include the strengthening of agencies and also to work early\n            on the approval and implementation of supportive regulations\n            that mandate coordination and effective regulation of\n            traditional bus operators, control of informality, and\n            elimination of parallel routes. There is a need to carry out\n            detailed operational and regulatory assessments upfront, on\n            a parallel front to the execution of the works in order to\n            lay the groundwork for the start of operations. Important\n            synergies have been created as a result of the simultaneous\n            implementation of projects in cities participating in the\n            National Urban Transport Program (NUTP). This has resulted\n            in a continuous flow of know-how and best practices among\n            participating cities, the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)\n            and the Bank, in areas such as civil works management,\n            procurement and fiduciary processes, safeguards management,\n            operational design, strategies for initiation of operation,\n            among others. The role of the central government in the\n            implementation of urban transport services reforms at the\n            local level needs to take the form of constant support from\n            the national government, particularly in areas such as the\n            regulation of transport services and negotiation of\n            concession agreements. Although the Specific Investment Loan\n            (SIL) instrument offered advantages over other instruments,\n            Bank support to well-structured government programs can take\n            the form of a programmatic results-based approach. A large\n            Technical Assistance (TA) component and more continuous and\n            close technical support to the implementing agencies are\n            required. Capacity building should go beyond enhancing the\n            capacity of the implementation unit and also focus on\n            strengthening its mandate and facilitating its work within\n            the ministry. It may be worth focusing on a set of simple,\n            measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART)\n            indicators that can be effectively managed by implementing\n            agencies. In addition, the monitoring and evaluation (M and\n            E) framework implementation needs to be the direct\n            responsibility of the PCU and not a task delegated to an\n            external consultant and that is never internalized and\n            implemented. Early consolidation of the environmental and\n            social management capacity is important to ensure timely\n            project implementation. Urban transport infrastructure\n            projects need to account for the risk of cost and time\n            overruns arising from the need to relocate or replace public\n            utility equipment and facilities that are affected as part\n            of construction works. It is important to strengthen the\n            capacity of implementing agencies to adequately evaluate\n            these projects and to ensure that project design includes\n            mandatory regulations issued by the national government that\n            provide guidance on the structuring and negotiation of these\n            concession agreements. The contracting of operations should\n            contemplate the conflicts of interest that can potentially\n            arise from the fact that the selected companies or consortia\n            can be operators of both the mass transit system and the\n            traditional bus system at the same time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Integrated Mass Transit Systems

(ii) improve accessibility\n            for the poor through feeder services and fare integration;\n            (iii) build greater institutional capacity at the national\n            level in order to formulate integrated urban transport\n            policies, and at the local level in order to improve urban\n            transport planning and traffic management.
