Multimodal Transit and Trade\n            Facilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was unsatisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that projects\n            that depend on exogenous factors (i.e., factors outside the\n            control of the project) should be treated as high-risk\n            projects and IDA should have an exit strategy if enabling\n            arrangements cannot be arranged ex ante. Bilateral and\n            regional initiatives, such as regional transit projects,\n            require political commitment and consensus by all parties to\n            succeed. In the South Asia context, this means that clear\n            economic benefits of regional cooperation can be\n            overshadowed by the regional politics. Stakeholder analysis\n            is important in projects that have significant,\n            non-reversible changes to the existing mode of operation.\n            Better sequencing of physical works with other related\n            project activities could maximize implementation success and\n            development effectiveness. Strong regulatory institutions\n            are essential for the success of private sector\n            participation in Inland Container Depot (ICD) operations.\n            While the obligations of the Terminal Management Company\n            (TMC) and His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMGN) are\n            specified in the contract, there is still a need to have a\n            strong regulatory institution to manage the contract,\n            especially when unanticipated situations arise that require\n            either clarification of the contract terms or possible\n            changes to the contract. Project Implementation Unit\n            arrangements can be effective if there is an absorption\n            strategy once the project is completed. It is important,\n            however, that the PIU does not operate under a difference\n            incentive structure as normal government agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Multimodal Transit and Trade\n            Facilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal -

A second set of project\n            objectives are to streamline trade and transit procedures\n            and to improve the efficiency and organization of transit\n            trade documentation and data exchange. There are nine\n            components: (1) The construction of an inland container\n            depot (ICD) at Sirsiya (Birgunj) comprises civil works for a\n            modern multimodal transfer terminal and actions related to\n            implementing the ACRP (Acquisition, Compensation, and\n            Rehabilitation Plan). (2) The next component improves the\n            road ICD at Biratnagar. (3) The civil works required to\n            improve the road-only facility at Bhairahwa include site\n            preparation, earth work, warehouse construction,\n            administrative buildings, and electrical systems. (4)\n            Procurement of equipment for three ICDs. (5) Internationally\n            experienced consultants to supervise the construction and\n            improvement of the three ICDs.
