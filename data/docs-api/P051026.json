A technical\n            assistance (TA) project provides valuable support for\n            preparing, and strengthening implementation of an adjustment\n            operation, thus it makes sense to extend, and adapt the TA\n            projects in line with the changes in emphasis of policy\n            reform. However, the Bank needs to take a more realistic\n            view of the time it takes to carry out TA-supported capacity\n            building, for it was clear from earlier operations in\n            Armenia, that twenty one months was a serious underestimate\n            of the time to build capacity for major economic reforms.\n            Furthermore, better donor coordination at the outset, would\n            more accurately signal the availability of grant funding\n            preferred by the Borrower, given a TA project can leverage\n            additional amounts for capacity
