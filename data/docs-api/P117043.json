This is expected to be reached via the following\n            specific objectives: (i) exerting effective state-owned\n            enterprises (SOE) oversight; (ii) improving central\n            administration's internal financial control; and (iii)\n            strengthening the tax system. This Development Policy Loan\n            (DPL) supports the Government reform plans and builds upon\n            the significant achievements in several areas of a previous\n            programmatic DPL in 2009. The operation was conceived within\n            the context of the FY09-13 Country Partnership Strategy\n            (CPS) to support the implementation of the government reform\n            plans.

This DPL focuses\n            on three program components: (i) state oversight of\n            state-owned enterprises; (ii) public sector financial\n            control (central administration); and
