Some\n            lessons learned includes: financing of Information\n            Analytical System for Social Assistance (ASSAP) operations\n            should be secured to ensure sustainability. Multiple\n            contingency plans should be made in case primary financing\n            fails to materialize. Some of the costs could be covered by\n            other budgets, such as funds allocated for the\n            administrative functions of the Ministry of Social Policy\n            (MOSP) or the social centers; even external donor funding\n            may be a source for the MOSP to explore. Procurement methods\n            affect the development process. Implementation of any kind\n            of uniform system across a country with great variance in\n            local capacity and attitudes requires strong oversight and\n            control mechanisms at the central level. Currently, the\n            Ministry is lacking virtually any capacity to coordinate\n            activities with the regions and local welfare offices and to\n            oversee their implementation, which needs to be taken into\n            account by any follow-up operations. Sustainability of\n            software, hardware, and knowledge to use the equipment must\n            be addressed before and during implementation. Arrangements\n            should be made at the outset of the project to ensure\n            financing of equipment maintenance. A cost/benefit analysis\n            will ease the process of securing funding for system\n            operations, maintenance and further development. Using\n            internal country systems where appropriate is a useful\n            cost-saving measure and can help in building capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Social Assistance System\n

The last supervision mission\n            recorded significant progress in all three project\n            components and the rating was upgraded. The project is now\n            at a phase when different activities under the three\n            components start fitting together, allowing the Project to\n            achieve its overall objective. Given the extension, end of\n            project target dates for achieving final results will be\n            adjusted accordingly. The extension is necessary to complete\n            ongoing management information system (MIS) related\n            activities, which are a key to attaining the project\n            development objective (PDO). The key milestones established\n            as conditions for considering project extension have been\n            met, particularly in terms of completion of civil works and\n            development of the MIS. The project's implementation\n            schedule has been revised to allow completing it by the\n            proposed closing date. This revised schedule puts project\n            activities into a tight timeframe and leaves no room for\n            delays. Recent payment delays by the national treasury\n            affected income tax (IT) contracts execution. Therefore, the\n            team agreed to reduce the minimum application size for\n            payments directly from the loan account from USD1.8 million\n            to USD200,000 for a six month period and already\n            communicated this decision to the Borrower. This reduction\n            will accelerate payments under large IT contracts. This will\n            be the second extension for the project. The first extension\n            was for 17 month reflecting far too short implementation\n            period for the project that covers introduction of the new\n            client intake model in more than 750 local welfare offices\n            all over Ukraine. The second extension will bring the\n            project's cumulative extensions to 30 months and the\n            overall project implementation period to five years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ukraine - Social Assistance\n            System Modernization Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/04/12139944/ukraine-social-assistance-system-modernization-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"UA-Social Assistance System Modernization\n            Project -- P075231","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,E-Business,Community Development and Empowerment,Housing & Human Habitats,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Social Development","count":"Ukraine","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20100422232838"},"theme":"Other social protection and risk management,Social safety nets,Social analysis and monitoring","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other social services","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Social Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Borrower, equipment, implementation period,\n            IP, Loan, Loan Account, procurement, procurement law,\n            procurement rules, Project implementation, result, results, supervision"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF051134-PHRD-UKRAINE: SOCIAL PROTECTION\n            REFORM ADMINISTRATION PROJECT,TF056178-UKRAINE SOCIAL ASSISTANCE\n            SYSTEM MODERNIZATION","majtheme":"Social protection and risk management","repnb":"54194"},"facets":{}}}
