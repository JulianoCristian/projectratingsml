The Decentralized Agricultural and Forestry\n            Extension Project had the following ratings: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory; sustainability was likely;\n            institutional development impact was substantial; Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned from this assessment\n            included: 1) Extension projects with grant-funded\n            Farmer-Managed Activities should provide for early\n            recognition of highly profitable farm-level innovations and\n            for dissemination to other farmers. Such projects should\n            facilitate the timely identification and dissemination of\n            both farmer-managed and research station innovations that\n            are profitable; 2) Research and extension projects should\n            directly address rather than bypass the problem of an\n            ineffective public sector extension service; 3) If a project\n            is de facto a pilot, then designate it a pilot project. The\n            Decentralized Agricultural and Forestry Extension Project\n            would have benefited from being explicitly designated as a\n            pilot project. Its expected outcomes would not have been as\n            high; 4) Project appraisal documents should describe not\n            only what activities are proposed, but also why they are\n            proposed; and 5) Projects should provide early intensive\n            training to local project staff on the application of Bank\n            procurement guidelines in order to prevent procurement deficiencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

As a\n            consequence, change management practices need to be\n            incorporated into the operating procedures for IAARD. When\n            reforming an institution that involves merging of personnel\n            from different agencies, tasked to do similar work,\n            comparable remuneration and benefits should be instituted up\n            front, and made a conditionality of project implementation.\n            To institutionalize gender and social issues in an\n            organization, it is important to mainstream gender and\n            social concerns early, organize teams, and train staff in\n            this topic. Regional Technology Assessment - Technological\n            innovations are more likely to be useful to and adopted by\n            farmers/fishers when they are tested and validated in a\n            participative manner under local conditions.\n            Farmer-to-farmer exchanges are very effective mechanisms for\n            introducing improved technologies. Any follow-up project\n            should give high priority to promoting farmer-managed\n            assessment and dissemination activities. Research and\n            Assessment Management - Local governments are only willing\n            to provide funding when they see tangible benefits to\n            farmers/fishers in their province or district.\n            Decentralization of Research and Development activities\n            becomes more successful when the IAARD accompanies this with\n            appropriate decentralization of authority and clear mandates."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Second Agricultural Research\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Second Agricultural\n
