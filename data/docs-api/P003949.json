Some lessons learned included:\n            institutional factors tend to predominate over economic or\n            technical factors in determining the success or otherwise of\n            projects in the kabupaten roads sector. Proper attention\n            needs to be paid to these, including a thorough stakeholder\n            analysis. The objective of establishing an effective\n            technical study framework that will feed into the existing\n            institutional process of decision-making was ambitious, and\n            could fully succeed only if there is a strong commitment at\n            the top. Transferring the implementation leadership to MPW\n            was not enough. Complexity is unavoidable in some projects,\n            because of the need to work on several fronts in parallel.\n            In such cases, one should not try to reduce artificially the\n            number of objectives. But rather be realistic in setting\n            sustainable targets for each objective. Projects dealing\n            intensively with local governments are demanding in terms of\n            supervision. If the thrust for more effective\n            decentralization is to succeed, future projects should\n            concentrate on a more limited number of provinces, and Bank\n            supervision should be leveraged trilogy more interventions\n            from the Field Office."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Third Kabupaten Roads\n            Development
