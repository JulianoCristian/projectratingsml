A\n            major benefit of the project will be its\n            institution-building impact. The most tangible benefit,\n            however, will be derived from the road rehabilitation\n            program in the form of vehicle operating cost savings which\n            will be passed on to users. There are about 400,000\n            inhabitants in the direct areas of influence of the roads.\n            There is no major risk associated with the project, as it is\n            mainly a continuation of efforts under the Third Highway\n            Project which is progressing satisfactorily."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin -
