A number of key lessons, both positive and\n            negative, were learned during the implementation of the\n            project which were summarized as follows: The\n            Government's strong commitment to reforms and\n            continuous support to seed sector commercialization effort\n            have been the foundation of the project design and the\n            pillar for project implementation. Close cooperation between\n            government agencies at various levels played a key role in\n            project implementation. Functional institutional arrangement\n            and close involvement of technical specialists also\n            contributed to the satisfactory project implementation. The\n            Project's simple objective and focused design were\n            considered key elements for satisfactory project\n            implementation. Procurement issues including one\n            mis-procurement declared by the World Bank had negative\n            effects on project implementation. This was derived mainly\n            from (i) project staff's insufficient knowledge of\n            World Bank procurement policies and procedures and contract\n            management and (ii) inadequate support from the World Bank\n            especially in the early years of project implementation.\n            Staff instability and discontinuity was a major problem for\n            some project management offices where project trained staff\n            were posted to other duties outside the project. In projects\n            with an important training component, an agreement might be\n            necessary among concerned parties that staff included in the\n            project training program should return to their original or\n            related posts to continue the staff's service for at\n            least a specified period with minimum predefined exceptions.\n            Failure to have such a requirement runs the risk of either\n            (i) less than optimum selection of candidates, or (ii)\n            wastage of the training investment through the loss of the\n            trained staff to other employment, or both."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Seed Sector Commercialization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Seed Sector\n            Commercialization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/12/2850155/china-seed-sector-commercialization-project","projn":"CN-Seeds Sector Commercialization Project -- P003638","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Business Environment,Business in Development,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Geographical Information Systems","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040107125320"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Law and justice,Crops","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounts,Agricultural\n            Investment,area,aspect,Borrower,borrowing,budget\n            analysis,business plans,Center,commercial\n            enterprises,commercial interest\n            rates,Commercialization,commitment,commitments,computer\n            aided design,cost savings,counterpart,counterpart\n            funds,Crop,crop production,Crop\n            Varieties,Crops,cultivars,DATES,disbursements,farm,farmer,farmers,farms,funding\n            sources,grace period,harvesters,IDA credit,LOAN,loan\n            amount,marketing,Natural Resources,plant\n            breeders,procurement,produce,production activities,Quality\n            Assurance,Quality Assurance Group,quality control,rice,rice\n            yields,sales,Seed,seed certification,Seed Companies,seed\n            industry,Seed management,seed policy,seed production,Seed Testing,SEEDS,subsidiary,suppliers,Union,wheat"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounts,Agricultural\n            Investment,area,aspect,Borrower,borrowing,budget\n            analysis,business plans,Center,commercial\n            enterprises,commercial interest\n            rates,Commercialization,commitment,commitments,computer\n            aided design,cost savings,counterpart,counterpart\n            funds,Crop,crop production,Crop\n            Varieties,Crops,cultivars,DATES,disbursements,farm,farmer,farmers,farms,funding\n            sources,grace period,harvesters,IDA credit,LOAN,loan\n            amount,marketing,Natural Resources,plant\n            breeders,procurement,produce,production activities,Quality\n            Assurance,Quality Assurance Group,quality control,rice,rice\n            yields,sales,Seed,seed certification,Seed Companies,seed\n            industry,Seed management,seed policy,seed production,Seed Testing,SEEDS,subsidiary,suppliers,Union,wheat"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF029172-PHRD-PREP.OF A SEED COMMERCIAL.PROJ.(BANK-EXECUTED),TF029223-PHRD -PREP.
