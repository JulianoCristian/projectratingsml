Ratings for the First and Second Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit (PRSC I and II) Projects for\n            Mozambique are as follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to\n            the development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects included: 1)\n            the very good macroeconomic performance sustained by\n            Mozambique over the last two decades suggests that as long\n            as the country is following prudent and effective\n            macroeconomic stabilization and management policies in the\n            context of ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n            programs, it is sufficient for the Bank's assistance\n            program, as has been done in the context of the EMPSO and\n            the PRSC series, to base its evaluation of macroeconomic\n            developments on IMF's assessment, and to provide\n            ancillary support, without devoting major extra efforts\n            itself across the whole spectrum within this policy area; 2)\n            the experience of Mozambique also suggests that the PRSC/GBS\n            modality seems to have yielded broadly satisfactory results,\n            which have been at least as good as alternative modalities,\n            but with the added advantage of having the country itself\n            leading its development agenda and playing a central role in\n            coordinating the assistance from its development partners.\n            The presumption of a proven track record, while not a\n            guarantee for continued success, is an important\n            pre-condition. Close monitoring and evaluation by the\n            country and its partners during implementation is also very\n            important; 3) the experience of the financial sector and\n            that of the telecommunications and air transport sectors,\n            suggests that accompanying budget support, or development\n            policy loan (DPL) operations, with related technical\n            assistance (TA) may increase the chances for success.\n            However, for more complicated sectors like private sector\n            development (PSD), or agricultural and rural development,\n            this may not be sufficient, and there may be a need for\n            additional interventions; and 4) stability in the\n            composition of Bank and counterpart project teams, and close\n            involvement of staff of the Bank's office in Maputo at\n            all stages of project preparation and implementation are\n            important for increasing the chances of success of\n            Bank-supported operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Economic Management and Private\n            Sector Operation Project; and First and Second Poverty\n

Government's\n            program of consolidating macroeconomic stability, and will\n            lay the foundation for sustained private sector-led growth\n            over the medium term. It includes measures to: extend budget\n            coverage, and conduct a public expenditure review; resolve\n            the financial difficulties of two banks, and reduce\n            Government ownership in the financial sector; strengthen\n            supervision in the financial sector; and, liberalize the\n            telecommunications, and air transport sectors, opening these\n            sectors to further, private participation. The project is\n            designed to support the objectives of the Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper, and is part of a continuing set of reforms,\n            designed to consolidate a stable macroeconomic environment,\n            sustain growth, and reduce poverty through improvements in\n            the sustainability of public sector delivery. However,\n            categories of risk include: political risks due to the\n            diminishing electoral margins of the ruling party, which\n            creates a climate of risk aversion, and a possible slowdown\n            in the implementation of reforms; macroeconomic risks, due\n            to diminished private sector confidence in the wake of\n            financial difficulties of the two partly, state-owned banks;\n            and, high fiduciary risks. The project will seek to diminish\n            macroeconomic risks, through reforms designed to lead\n            increased transparency, and reducing state ownership in the\n            banking sector; and, to mitigate fiduciary risks, the\n            Government is already following the agreed action plans."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Economic Management and Private\n

Project is to support the Government's\n            program to consolidate macroeconomic stability and to lay\n            the foundations for sustained private sector-led growth over\n            the medium term. One of the components is to make progress\n            with the privatization of the petroleum company PETROMOC.\n            The objectives of this environmental pre-audit is to: carry\n            out a pre-audit of a representative number of the facilities\n            of PETROMOC, and to develop a ranking to determine which\n            types of facilities will need a full, partial, or no\n            environmental audit or environmental assessment before\n            divestiture; measure the environmental conditions of the\n            facilities against risk of being held responsible for\n            damages after divestiture; use the baseline information to\n            assist the borrower in preparing guidelines to ensure the\n            necessary audits be taken according to the ranking study;\n            and review the national legislative framework to ascertain\n            whether the government or the new private investors will be\n            legally responsible for clean-up measures. The pre-audit\n            recommends that a full audit be done for the three main and\n            five smaller facilities as well as partial audits for at\n            least 20 representative retail outlets and a representative\n            sample of the 19 depots."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Economic Management and Private\n            Sector Operation Project : environmental impact assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Economic Management\n            and Private Sector Operation Project : environmental impact assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/08/1695636/mozambique-economic-management-private-sector-operation-project-environmental-impact-assessment","projn":"MZ-Empso -- P049878","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Water and Industry,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Mozambique","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02021604100843"},"subsc":"Aviation,Oil and gas,Banking,Telecommunications,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Air,Air Quality,aquatic\n            species,aquifer,aquifers,asphalt,AUDITS,BOD,Carbon,Carbon\n            Dioxide,catchment,catchment area,clean-up,coal,COD,community\n            water,cooling,depression,diffusion,drainage,electricity,Emissions,Environmental\n            Evaluation,environmental impact assessment,Environmental\n            Management,Environmental Monitoring,environmental\n            performance,Environmental Protection,EVALUATION\n            CRITERIA,Gas,gases,groundwater,hazardous\n            wastes,hydrocarbons,insurance,laws,legislation,Macroeconomics,managers,media,mining,Occupational\n            Health,oil,oil spills,Oxidation,Oxygen,Oxygen\n            Demand,partnership,pipelines,pipes,pollution,pollution\n            levels,potable water,Private Sector,pumping,pumping\n            stations,pumping systems,pumps,rivers,safety,safety\n            equipment,safety measures,seawater,ships,soils,solid\n            waste,solid waste disposal,Spill Control,storage\n            tanks,Sulfur Dioxide,surface water,underground\n            tanks,Volatile Organic Compounds,waste,waste disposal,waste\n            management,Waste water,wells,wetlands,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"Air,Air Quality,aquatic\n            species,aquifer,aquifers,asphalt,AUDITS,BOD,Carbon,Carbon\n            Dioxide,catchment,catchment area,clean-up,coal,COD,community\n            water,cooling,depression,diffusion,drainage,electricity,Emissions,Environmental\n            Evaluation,environmental impact assessment,Environmental\n            Management,Environmental Monitoring,environmental\n            performance,Environmental Protection,EVALUATION\n            CRITERIA,Gas,gases,groundwater,hazardous\n            wastes,hydrocarbons,insurance,laws,legislation,Macroeconomics,managers,media,mining,Occupational\n            Health,oil,oil spills,Oxidation,Oxygen,Oxygen\n            Demand,partnership,pipelines,pipes,pollution,pollution\n            levels,potable water,Private Sector,pumping,pumping\n            stations,pumping systems,pumps,rivers,safety,safety\n            equipment,safety measures,seawater,ships,soils,solid\n            waste,solid waste disposal,Spill Control,storage\n            tanks,Sulfur Dioxide,surface water,underground\n            tanks,Volatile Organic Compounds,waste,waste disposal,waste\n            management,Waste water,wells,wetlands,workers"}},"owner":"AFT: PREM 1 (AFTP1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"E538"},"facets":{}}}
