Some lessons learned included: the strong\n            leadership by the Prime Minister's Chancellery was\n            crucial for the success of the PAL1, but with hindsight more\n            attention can have also been paid to strengthening capacity\n            in the other parts of the Government. Such stronger\n            capacity, and a revamped public administration, can have\n            helped sustain the momentum on reforms even after the\n            strategic goal of European Union (EU) accession was met and\n            after the new government came to power. As with other\n            middle-income countries with access to capital markets or EU\n            resources, being flexible is important. This lesson will be\n            of particular importance for the World Bank's\n            engagement with the countries of the western Balkans. For\n            these countries, as prospects of EU accession firm, EU funds\n            will increase and private foreign capital strengthen,\n            building on rising investor

The PAL program reflects the\n            Government's overarching objectives of establishing\n            solid economic growth, reducing poverty and joining the\n            European Union. These objectives will be addressed by\n            focusing on five key, cross-cutting themes: establishing\n            public sector accountability; instilling financial\n            discipline; instituting regulatory reforms; following good\n            social and environment risk management practices; and\n            ensuring property rights. In addition, the PAL provides\n            continuity with previous adjustment operations b y ensuring\n            sustained progress on the structural reforms begun under\n            Private Sector Adjustment Loans 1 and 2, while at the same\n            time introducing a new program of phased public sector and\n            regulatory reforms that emphasizes institutional development\n            and effective implementation. The program is divided into\n            two parts. The first part focuses on reforming core public\n            sector institutions and processes. The second targets the\n            public- private interface and regulation of markets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - First Programmatic Adjustment Loan
