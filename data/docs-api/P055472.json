Some lessons learned included:\n            the challenging urban mobility needs of rapidly developing\n            urban centers in Sub-Saharan Africa require the\n            establishment of well-staffed and well-managed lead agency\n            to coordinate the activities of multiple stakeholders,\n            including the central Government. In sprawling urban centers\n            experiencing rapid growth of their population and increased\n            poverty, transport needs, and management of transport issues\n            can be very challenging in the face of weak capacity at the\n            central and local government levels and a mushrooming\n            informal transport sector. Fleets of old transport vehicles\n            compounded with lack of investment in the road\n            infrastructure are causes of poor quality of transport\n            services, congestion, increased road accidents and poor\n            safety of the road users. Having a dedicated agency able to\n            coordinate the needs of all the stakeholders in order to\n            improve urban mobility is a critical step in the right\n            direction for coordinating urban transport management, for\n            policy formulation and implementation, and for consensus\n            building among actors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Urban Mobility

environmental impacts resulting from the\n            implementation of the Urban Mobility Improvement Project,\n            envisaged to affect physical, biological, and social\n            conditions. Soil erosion will occur, a major threat being\n            the flow of rainwater, and waste disposal of both solid, and\n            liquid wastes, creating water pollution. However, it is\n            expected that air pollution will improve following\n            construction, as a result of better traffic mobilization,\n            due to the diminished road traffic in favor of an improved\n            rail traffic, as well as adequate measures to accommodate\n            parking lots, and improve gas quality. Prior to\n            implementation, landowners, and residents should be\n            identified, ensuring adequate compensation, public awareness\n            campaigns should be conducted to inform on the consequences\n            of project works, and, bid document be revised to ensure\n            inclusion of environmental protection clauses. Mitigation\n            measures to be adopted during construction, and operation of\n            the project are: To diminish soil erosion, a waste\n            management plan will be established, to remove, dispose, and\n            treat wastes in an environmentally safe manner; Vegetation\n            will be planted on slopes to prevent further erosion, and\n            adequate drainage will be provided; Infiltration ditches\n            will capture silt, and pollutants; Adequate equipment, and\n            sound barriers will reduce noise, and dust pollution; and,\n            Safety measures will be enforced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Summary -
