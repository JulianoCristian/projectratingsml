They often are of a political economy nature, as\n            well as technical; and both kinds of risks need to be\n            recognized and planned for. In Indonesia, reluctance to\n            introduce accompanying regulations to new laws was an\n            indicator that new institutional arrangements had yet to\n            mature; and that government was not yet ready to firm up its\n            options for defining new responsibilities. Conventional\n            government processes (budget processes, fiduciary controls)\n            should be amenable to adjustment, especially when the\n            emphasis is on piloting new methods. The purpose of piloting\n            is to learn and adapt, which requires some flexibility. All\n            three projects were piloting new complex reforms in an\n            unsettled environment. All three were closely sequenced,\n            offering limited opportunity for transmitting learning from\n            one project to another. Projects introducing new\n            institutions must be seen as opportunities for learning and\n            improving, and sequencing should have that in mind."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - First, Second, and Third Phase\n            of the Provincial Health Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia -

Some of the lessons learned included: 1)\n            providing Bank funding for decentralized activities entails\n            considerable risk to project success in a situation where\n            lower level entities, in this case primarily districts, do\n            not have clear indications of what specific functions they\n            can or cannot undertake, particularly if these functions are\n            not set forth in legislation. Some districts, like Subang in\n            West Java were successful in developing local workforce and\n            financing policies because of the dynamic and resourceful\n            leadership, and the willingness to mobilize required\n            technical assistance either from the province level or from\n            consultants; 2) projects will meet difficulties if authority\n            is decentralized without provision of specific standards for\n            implementing these authorities. One of the major\n            frustrations of provinces and districts was being given\n            authority in the laws for undertaking general functions that\n            could be used to foster reforms but then not having the\n            ability to set standards for ensuring that these functions\n            could be properly performed. Nevertheless, North Sumatera\n            and West Java had some progress in their reform efforts by\n            learning from and adopting some of the reform ideas\n            developed by the Yogyakarta Province, although\n            administrative problems prevented the provinces from\n            achieving more results. This is made possible by the good\n            cross learning environment established between first and\n            second Provincial Health Project (PHP I and II); and 3) in\n            situations of great institutional change and turbulence,\n            reform oriented projects should set priorities for which\n            reforms should be taken in what sequence. Attempting to\n            implement too wide a scope of reforms at the same time\n            places a large burden on project implementers operating in\n            situations of great uncertainty. If the Bank is also well\n            out in front of the client in terms of the how well the\n            client understands the proposed reforms and how they can be\n            best addressed, the implementation difficulties are only compounded."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Second Provincial Health Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Second Provincial\n            Health Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/06/9735922/indonesia-second-provincial-health-project","projn":"ID-Provincial Health II -- P049539","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Banks & Banking Reform,Housing & Human Habitats,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements,Rural Development","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20080805050142"},"theme":"Decentralization,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Other communicable diseases,Health system performance","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Health,Compulsory health finance","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ability to pay, access to health services,\n            accountability, ADB, allocative efficiency, Auditing,\n            auditors, audits, Bank Ratings, basic health services, block\n            grants, certification, civil service, communicable disease\n            control, communicable diseases, Decentralization,\n            decentralization process, Districts, economics,\n            environmental health, equipment, exercises, extension,\n            externalities, externality, financial control, financial\n            controls, Financial Management, financing policies, Gender,\n            health care, health care organizations, health care use,\n            health care utilization, health centers, health centres,\n            health education, health expenditures, health facilities,\n            health finance, health financing, health indicators, Health\n            Information, Health Information System, health information\n            systems, Health Insurance, health management, health\n            manpower, health organization, health organizations, health\n            outcomes, health plans, health policies, health policy,\n            health professionals, health projects, Health Promotion,\n            health reform, Health Research, health sector, health\n            service, health service provision, health services, health\n            status, Health system, Health system performance, health\n            systems, hospitals, households, Human Development, human\n            resource management, improvements in health, income,\n            incremental costs, Institutional Development, internal\n            audits, internal controls, interventions, laboratories,\n            Laws, legislation, Local Government, local governments,\n            localities, managed care, municipalities, NGOs, Nutrition,\n            Pacific Region, PHO, present value, public health, public\n            health programs, public hospitals, quality of health,\n            Regional Development, regulatory framework, reorganization,\n            resource allocation, Resource Mobilization, retirement, risk\n            management, Safety, Technical Assistance, work force"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF025117-PHRD-PROVINCIAL HEALTH PROJ.

These\n            responsibilities encompass providing sectoral vision and\n            leadership, analysis and policy follow-up of the health\n            needs of the poor and risks to the public at-large, advocacy\n            of best practices and standards, and support for local\n            initiative. This project has two components.
