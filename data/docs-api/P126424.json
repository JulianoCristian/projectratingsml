Some\n            lessons learned included: direct World Bank funding to civil\n            society organizations (CSOs) to contribute to Government of\n            Indonesia (GoI) programs enables the Bank to play a critical\n            convening role and opens opportunities for the partners to\n            appreciate the added-value these different actors bring to\n            the development process. Working with Executing\n            Organizations (Eos) enabled the project to tap into their\n            partner CSOs\u2019 field expertise to reach beneficiary groups\n            not easily accessed - physically or socially. Economic\n            poverty alleviation efforts and livelihood improvement is a\n            useful but not sufficient entry point for reaching excluded\n            groups. Adapting World Bank financial and administrative\n            processes and requirements when granting to (national) CSOs\n            makes them more accessible and functional for local CSO\n            partners in the field, while still meeting globally accepted\n            fiduciary and governance standards. Longer-term commitment\n            on engagement and provision of flexibility is a necessity\n            for pilot programs to successfully work on innovation around\n            complex issues, enabling them to experiment with a variety\n            of approaches and providing evidence for the alternative\n            approaches emerging."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - PNPM Peduli
