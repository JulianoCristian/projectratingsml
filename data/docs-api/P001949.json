creating an\n            appropriate structure for executing comprehensive feeder\n            road programs. The project would finance: (a) highway\n            construction equipment and spare parts; (b) labor, materials\n            and supplies for the improvement program; (c) expert\n            services to assist in establishing a Feeder Roads Technical\n            Section in the Directorate of Public Works, in implementing\n            and monitoring the above program, and in training\n            technicians, mechanics, equipment operators and training\n            officers; and (d) construction of offices for the newly\n            created Feeder Road Technical Section. The improved feeder\n            road network will substantially reduce vehicle operating\n            costs, ameliorate the present marketing and input\n            distribution system and decrease storage costs and losses to\n            the farmer from crop wastage in the field."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Projet de pistes rurales"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Feeder Roads Project :\n            Niger - Projet de pistes rurales"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1979/02/15476501/niger-feeder-roads-project-niger-projet-de-pistes-rurales","projn":"NE-Feeder Roads-267038 -- P001949","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Regional Rural Development,Urban Transport,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Rural Development,Transport,Agriculture","count":"Niger","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sahel!$!Sahel"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sahel!$!Sahel"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sahel!$!Sahel"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sahel!$!Sahel"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20111116023259"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Transport,Agriculture","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Construction; Costs; Crop losses; Feeder\n            roads; Food storage; Improvement; Maintenance & repair;\n            Roads & highways; Spare parts; Vehicle operating costs,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Construction; Costs; Crop losses; Feeder\n            roads; Food storage; Improvement; Maintenance & repair;\n            Roads & highways; Spare parts; Vehicle operating costs,,"}},"owner":"CD13: BN/NE/TG (AFC13)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sahel"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sahel"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sahel"},"3":{"geo_region":"Sahel"}},"repnb":"2219","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Niger - Projet de pistes rurales"}}},"facets":{}}}
