The two principal objectives\n            of the program were: (a) to address the risk of widespread\n            famine in Zimbabwe; and (b) to provide the conditions under\n            which the productive sectors could rebound quickly from the\n            drought.  Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) approval to procure\n            inputs must be given in time whilst sourcing for funds is\n            still in progress; (ii) there is need for government to\n            provide enough funds for the whole project especially if the\n            component involves different ministries; (iii) the project\n            revealed the capacity constraint of government agencies in\n            implementing emergency drought relief operations\n            effectively; (iv) government should encourage and provide\n            incentives for input suppliers to invest in input\n            distribution warehouses in small holder farm areas; (v)\n            planning should not be centralised and whenever possible\n            involve all levels and layers of beneficiaries to enable\n            transparency and acceptability; (vi) emergency procurement\n            procedures need to be more carefully designed and fully\n            articulated at appraisal stage; (vii) the government Tender\n            Board should be requested to process emergency tenders on\n            their own instead of mixing them with other tenders; and\n            (viii) during the identification and appraisal stage,\n            Government should play a more significant role inorder to\n            influence project

         Government with timely financial resources in support of its\n            drought relief and recovery program.  This program will\n            alleviate human suffering, both at present and in the\n            future, by restoring and enhancing Zimbabwe's\n            productive capacity.  It will do so by providing\n            agricultural inputs that are essential for the next planting\n            season, rehabilitating the water supply system, providing\n            for critical inputs for the transport of goods needed for\n            relief and recovery, and upgrading the public works programs\n            through which drought relief is distributed.  The program is\n            designed to give special consideration to the recovery needs\n            of agricultural smallholders.  The project will also help\n            narrow the balance of payments gap that will result from\n            incremental imports and the collapse of food exports.  This\n            will lessen the risk that this natural disaster might derail\n            the Government's broad based economic structural\n            adjustment program.  Finally, the project will assure the\n            strengthening of short and long-term institutional capacity\n            in agriculture, water, and public works, to reduce the\n            country's

         Government with timely financial resources in support of its\n            drought relief and recovery program.  This program will\n            alleviate human suffering, both at present and in the\n            future, by restoring and enhancing Zimbabwe's\n            productive capacity.  It will do so by providing\n            agricultural inputs that are essential for the next planting\n            season, rehabilitating the water supply system, providing\n            for critical inputs for the transport of goods needed for\n            relief and recovery, and upgrading the public works programs\n            through which drought relief is distributed.  The program is\n            designed to give special consideration to the recovery needs\n            of agricultural smallholders.  The project will also help\n            narrow the balance of payments gap that will result from\n            incremental imports and the collapse of food exports.  This\n            will lessen the risk that this natural disaster might derail\n            the Government's broad based economic structural\n            adjustment program.  Finally, the project will assure the\n            strengthening of short and long-term institutional capacity\n            in agriculture, water, and public works, to reduce the\n            country's vulnerability to future external risks and to\n            increase food security."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Technical annex"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zimbabwe - Emergency Drought\n
