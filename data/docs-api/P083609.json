Some lessons learned included: it\n            is easier to build agricultural export facilities with\n            project funds than to find private entrepreneurs willing and\n            capable to take them over and run them. This holds true even\n            when project management is aware of this fact and tries from\n            the beginning to prepare for handover. Horticultural\n            production and exports, especially in the greater Dakar\n            area, are situated in a fast-changing environment, where\n            factors such as rapid urbanization and relative costs of\n            different modes of transport (air, sea, and road) can\n            quickly change the optimal location of export facilities and\n            render some of them no longer useful or financially viable.\n            Projects that seek to introduce game-changing institutional\n            and technical innovations and that depend for their success\n            on the buy-in of people who cannot be identified in advance\n            (auto-selection) must have a first-class, professional,\n            interactive communication strategy that uses all forms of\n

This environmental impact assessment (EIA) report\n            evaluated the following impactcs : use of pesticides;\n            erosion; social conflicts among project beneficiaries;\n            damage caused by irrigation works to surrounding areas; use\n            of ground and surface water; access routes to rice fields\n            and their maintenance; topography of irrigated agriculture\n            fields; pump stations specifications; and public health.
