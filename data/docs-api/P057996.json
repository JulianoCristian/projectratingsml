In its strategy for development\n            and poverty reduction, the government identified\n            decentralization as critical to improving the living\n            conditions of rural populations. The National Rural\n            Infrastructure Project was designed as the first\u0096or testing\n            phase\u0096of a potentially 12-year program to help strengthen\n            rural Senegal\u0092s local governments and their ability to\n            operate and maintain infrastructure investments \u0096 starting\n            with the building of roads. In addition to institutional\n            support, IDA provided financing for local investments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Local governments upgrade rural\n            infrastructure in Senegal"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Local governments upgrade rural\n            infrastructure in Senegal"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2007/03/24029666/local-governments-upgrade-rural-infrastructure-senegal","count":"Senegal","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to essential services, Agricultural\n            Development, basic infrastructure, beneficiary communities,\n            health centers, household incomes, households, living\n            conditions, local development, local governments, poor,\n            poverty line, poverty reduction, progress, public services,\n            roads, rural, rural communities, Rural Infrastructure, Rural\n            Infrastructure Project, rural phenomenon, rural populations,\n            schools, social development, water supply, young people"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","topic":"Population m1327736 640,Rural Community Driven Development (CDD)\n            m1325992 1964,Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947,Land and Housing m1327648 817,Infrastructure and Growth m1326244 1083","projn":"SN-Participatory Local Development Program\n            -- P088656,SN-National Rural Infrastructure Project -- P057996","subtopic":"Population Policies,Rural Poverty Reduction,Housing & Human Habitats,Urban Services to the Poor","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Urban Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction","entityids":{"entityid":"000470435_20150220131854"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"General education sector,Water supply,Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways,Primary education,Health,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General transportation sector,General public administration sector","theme":"Decentralization,Rural markets,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Improving labor markets","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Urban Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Population m1327736 640,Rural Community Driven Development (CDD)\n            m1325992 1964,Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947,Land and Housing m1327648 817,Infrastructure and Growth m1326244 1083","owner":"Urban, Rural & Soc Dev - GP (GSURR)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"TF025092-PHRD-NATIONAL RURAL\n            INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"92856"},"6947679":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/06/6947679/senegal-national-rural-infrastructure-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/06/6947679/senegal-national-rural-infrastructure-project","new_url":"2006/06/6947679/senegal-national-rural-infrastructure-project","disclosure_date":"2006-08-14T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/07/25/000090341_20060725155530/Rendered/INDEX/36541.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/07/25/000090341_20060725155530/Rendered/PDF/36541.pdf","credit_no":"3315;Q102","datestored":"2006-07-25T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2006-06-29T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Gray cover","versiontyp_key":"1309938","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Senegal - National Rural Infrastructure Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the National Rural\n            Infrastructure Report for Senegal were as follows: the\n            outcome was highly satisfactory, the sustainability was\n            likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the project: To be\n            effective, decentralization must be multi-sectoral. It is\n            therefore not practical to anchor such a project within a\n            technical ministry. Decentralization is a long-term and\n            comprehensive effort that requires political support. The\n            major changes expected are likely to meet resistance from\n            some institutions. Therefore considerable effort is needed\n            for new systems to be established and officials to be\n            educated and convinced to accept changes. The NRIP has shown\n            that the planning process of Government needed to be\n            modified to use a bottom-up approach. To support this type\n            of multi-faceted decentralization program, the importance of\n            the multi-disciplinary team involved in project supervision\n            was critical in achieving project objectives. Sustainability\n            depends on the degree to which the beneficiaries internalize\n            the process. The ability to continue the planning,\n            implementing and monitoring of investments using\n            participatory processes depends on the continuing to raise\n            funds and

country faces to sustain a long-term\n            agricultural development.

Secondly, the EA explores\n            ecological constraints, indicating vast soil, and water\n            erosion, partly due to drainage malpractice, drought, and\n            exhaustive livestock productivity.
