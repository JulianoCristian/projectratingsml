The education credit is\n            the second credit to Ethiopia and, together with the highway\n            credit of 1963, will increase our total commitment to about\n            $21 million as compared with total Bank loans of about $57\n            million. In the past Bank financing has been repeatedly\n            channeled into highway construction and telecommunications,\n            with a small amount to the Development Bank of Ethiopia. The\n            present education project and the prospective agricultural\n            credit project and a water and sewage project for the city\n            of Addis Ababa will certainly be welcome additions to the\n            areas with which we have been associated with in the past\n            and most likely will continue to be associated in the\n            future. Bank pointed out that Ethiopia's performance in\n            certain sector such as exports, transport and power, has\n            been satisfactory.
