Some lessons learned include: project approach\n            is not the more efficient way for sustainable capacity\n            building. So, developing local governmental capacities\n            requires a national program, based on sustainable resources\n            and strong political commitment that eventually will be\n            supported by donors. The project demonstrated the\n            feasibility and sustainability of microcredit operations for\n            generating income activities in Mauritania. Slum upgrading\n            has limitations when there is a lack of established\n            appropriate regulatory frameworks for land development in an\n            urban environment. Therefore, an appropriate and rigorous\n            compensation policy coupled with an efficient land ownership\n            control system for illegal land occupation will be necessary\n            for successful slum rehabilitation. The amount paid by\n            low-income people to have access to land property rights is\n            very low as compared to the existing land market value.\n            Depending on local conditions, additional arrangements needs\n            to be put in place to ensure that only targeted people are\n            benefitting from such programs, and will keep this benefit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Urban Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mauritania - Urban Development

The Program should be carried out in\n            two phases; the first phase in progress must be completed on\n            June 30th, 2011. Before starting the second stage of PDU, a\n            supplementary program was initiated with the support of an\n            additional financing from IDA. This supplementary phase will\n            relate to the achievement of the following infrastructures:\n            Road and draining systems, water supply system and\n            electrification.  The achievement of the urban\n            roadway/drainage system works and infrastructures, of\n            electrification and water conveyance can have environmental\n            or social impacts, either individually, or in a cumulative\n            way, in the project\u0092s target districts. However, these\n            negative effects were perceived as moderate or minor during\n            the former programs. In the production phase (management),\n            the crucial issue of the achieved facility management will\n            be raised: maintenance of the roadway system (cleaning,\n            sweeping); maintenance of the gutters (clearing out); etc.\n            To take these aspects into account, this Environmental and\n            Social Management Framework Plan (ESMFP), adapted to the\n            sub-components was carried out to permit determine the\n            identification and management mechanisms and procedures of\n            these potential negative incidences. The projects will have\n            major positive effects on the social level, with relatively\n            minor negative consequences. On the other hand, the\n            infrastructures (roadway system), and the environmental\n            projects (works of drainage, water conveyance, etc) will\n            have positive effects as well as minor or moderate negative\n            impacts. Even though they permit to improve the setting and\n            living conditions, these projects will, all the same,\n            somewhat contribute to the degradation of the living\n            environment in the urban area if accompaniment measures are\n            not taken."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Plan cadre de gestion environnementale et sociale"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mauritanie -
