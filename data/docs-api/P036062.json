The lessons learned\n            indicate that the project helped improve relations between\n            forest departments and local people from a high conflict\n            situation to one of improved cooperation and collaboration\n            through implementation of the ecodevelopment model. The\n            creation of microplans and community funds linked village\n            development to Protected Area (PA) protection and provided\n            villagers with choices about livelihood and development\n            options. The long-term sustainability and success of the\n            ecodevelopment programs and individual Ecodevelopment\n            Committees (EDCs) can be enhanced through linkages to\n            political processes and local and national government\n            programs. India has a strong civil society movement, both\n            pro-conservation and pro-poor, and the project attracted\n            much criticism for a) sacrificing biodiversity objectives to\n            address poverty issues and b) disadvantaging poor\n            communities to support wildlife conservation. The need to\n            provide 25 percent co-financing towards ecodevelopment\n            activities led to some village families being excluded from\n            ecodevelopment benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

Ecodevelopment Project Rajiv Ghandi\n            (Nagarahole) National Park : Report and Recommendation on\n            Request for Inspection"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The India Ecodevelopment Project has two\n            main thrusts: to support management of protected areas of\n            significant global biodiversity, and to protect local people\n            living in and around these areas. Both are important goals\n            but there are inherent conflicts as well as potential\n            complementarities between them. Tribal people from one of\n            the seven sites-Nagarahole, filed a Request for Inspection\n            claiming that no specific indigenous peoples development\n            plan had been prepared with the informed participation of\n            affected indigenous/tribal groups. They fear that an\n            anticipated forceful eviction of the tribal population from\n            the project area will result in them being uprooted from\n            their forest habitats, which are their socio-cultural life\n            base. They believe that current and potential harm is a\n            result of the Bank's own failure to follow its policies\n            and procedures. Management decided that past experience with\n            conservation projects in areas with human pressures pointed\n            towards a process design project which, after a period of\n            indicative planning to establish the framework and define\n            appropriate processes, proceeded to get things done on the\n            ground. Indicative planning to establish the main areas of\n            conflict, appropriate participatory mechanisms, eligible\n            types of investment, and effective institutional\n            arrangements was undertaken during project preparation.\n            Management appears to have been aware of the paucity of\n            information and research at the appraisal stage. In simply\n            accepting the fact that objective data and scientific\n            studies were very limited, however, the International\n            Development Association (IDA) appears to have allowed much\n            of the debate about the potential conflict between the two\n            main thrusts of the project to be conducted on the basis of\n            predetermined views and unsubstantiated claims. Management\n            acknowledges that the Project did not carry out the\n            \"identification of local preferences through direct\n            consultation\" at the appraisal stage. Instead of\n            complying directly with the OD 4.20's directives in the\n            appraisal phase, Management intended that \"more\n            detailed consultation\" would follow during\n            implementation. Management admits that no separate\n            Indigenous Peoples' Development Plan was prepared\n            during the appraisal stage, as required by OD 4.30. If an\n            Indigenous People's Development Plan had been prepared,\n            it would have further exposed the tension between\n            biodiversity protection objectives and the condition and\n            aspirations of the indigenous people at Rajiv Gandhi\n            National Park. It would have enabled significant input on\n            the basic assumptions and concepts underlying the\n            Ecodevelopment Project. The Panel finds that certain key\n            premises underlying the design phase of the Project at the\n            Nagarahole site are flawed, as a result of which there is a\n            significant potential for serious harm.
