The\n            lessons learned indicate that the project implementation by\n            existing government agencies is feasible in Lebanon, and has\n            the advantage of minimizing the need for transition\n            arrangements at the end of the project provided that\n            adequate resources and training are made available. Approval\n            and financial procedures for project investments should be\n            streamlined before project start-up. Training in Bank\n            procurement and financial procedures is essential and it\n            should take place at an early stage, especially for\n            government agencies that have no prior exposure to the Bank.\n            A solid Environment Unit is essential for the success of\n            infrastructure development and it should be established at\n            the beginning of the project.
