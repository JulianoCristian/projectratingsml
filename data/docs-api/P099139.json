Some lessons learned included:\n            while conceiving a whole-of-government M&E system it is\n            critical to include both technical and political economy\n            considerations to ensure that such system is both\n            technically sound and that it\u2019s effectively utilized by its\n            intended users. In the case of this project, the design of\n            dashboards tailored to the needs of the Office of the\n            Presidency and line ministers, illustrates the importance of\n            addressing the needs of strategic users. The institutional\n            and economic impact of an operation is not necessarily\n            correlated to its size. While this operation was very small\n            in the context of the Bank\u2019s portfolio in Colombia, it has\n            had a significant impact in Colombia and beyond, as SINERGIA\n            is considered by OECD standards as a cutting-edge M&E\n            system with characteristics to be emulated elsewhere. It is\n            important to note that if a Project of similar\n            characteristics were to be prepared today, Reimbursable\n            Advisory Services (RAS) will be a more adequate instrument\n            than an investment loan. Borrowers, particularly\n            sophisticated ones such as Colombia, can be the natural\n            drivers of sector-wide initiatives. While the Bank played a\n            key role in helping Colombia build awareness and consensus\n            over the importance of strengthening its M&E system, the\n            DNP played a central role in steering implementation of this\n            project. This, in turn, brings attention to the range of\n            roles to be played by the Bank in sector-wide interventions\n            in which IBRD funding is relatively small and the Borrower\n            has strong technical and institutional capacity and\n            strategic vision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

On November 1,\n            2011, the Government of Colombia (GoC) requested a second\n            restructuring of the project. The changes, described in this\n            restructuring paper, seek to: i) modify the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) to reflect the name of the new\n            Government agency which will approve the evaluation agenda\n            in the future; ii) modify some of the activities outlined in\n            the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for each of the project\n            components: iii) modify the PDO and intermediate results\n            indicators in the results framework matrix; iv) revise the\n            project cost per component to reflect the current\n            circumstances after almost three years of implementation;\n            and v) revise the funding allocations of the loan agreement.\n            The request entails a Level one restructuring due to the\n            slight modification of the PDO. The implementation schedule\n            will remain the same. A level two restructuring was approved\n            by the World Bank on September 9, 2010 in response to the\n            Government's request to revise the funding allocations\n            need for a significant number of training events,\n            dissemination activities, and editing and publication of\n            materials. In addition, the definition of\n            'training' was revised in section four, Part of\n            the loan agreement. The changes are to provide more\n            flexibility in use of project funds in order to avoid future\n            amendments to the loan agreement and to reflect new\n            government priorities by incorporating new activities\n            related to open data and 'Sinergia Territoral' and\n            removing activities no longer critical to the achievement of\n            the PDO. The restructuring will also slightly modify the\n            PDO, as the government has decided to replace the authority\n            to approve the evaluation agenda from the\n            Inter-institutional Evaluations Committee (IEC) to the\n            Economic and Social Council (CONPES)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
