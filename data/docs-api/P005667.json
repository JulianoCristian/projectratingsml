The objectives of\n            the project were: (a) to increase financial resources\n            available to and strengthen the term lending operations of\n            commercial banks so as to establish medium and long-term\n            instruments for SMI financing; (b) to finance economically\n            and financially sound and technically feasible projects in\n            the small and medium scale sector; (c) to foster a new class\n            of industrial  entrepreneurs to provide managers and\n            technicians to the industrial sector; and(d) to create\n            employment at an investment cost per job lower than the\n            national average in the industrial sector.  Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was satisfactory. One of the main lessons from this project\n            is that banks' participation in financial\n            intermediation projects should be based on analysis of their\n            ability to intermediate including, inter alia, the quality\n            of their loan portfolios. Such analysis, in turn, is\n            predicated on having in place strict prudential regulations,\n            against which the quality of the portfolio and the\n            profitability of the institutions can be measured. In\n            addition, sub-project eligibility    criteria should reflect\n            the reality of the local situation and be relevant to the\n            participating banks, so as to ensure that the banks will\n            have an interest in respecting the criteria Finally,\n            projects would do better to focus either on financial sector\n            issues or real sector issues, rather than mix them both in\n            the same project, as this one did. In this case too little\n            analysis was done of the proper role of support\n            institutions, and during implementation, little attention\n            was paid to the technical assistance and training efforts\n            that had been planned for the banks and the support institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia -
