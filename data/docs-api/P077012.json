Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social\n            Services (KALAHI-CIDSS) Project for Philippines were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: adopt phased scaling-up and\n            flexible learning-by-doing approach informed by empirical\n            evidence to enhance prospects of success. KC is distinct\n            from other similar Community Driven Development (CDD)\n            programs that tend to bypass the government. Deepening\n            linkages with the LGUs and the line agencies was a critical\n            design feature to mainstream the CDD principles into the\n            local development system as enshrined in the LGC. While much\n            remains to be done, KC managed to lay an important\n            foundation for NCDDP to build on. Future CDD programs should\n            build in means to strengthen linkages between the\n            communities and the local governments and sectoral agencies\n            from the outset, rather than try to link them\n            retrospectively which is much harder. Despite its robust\n            M&E framework, KC suffered from Results Framework (RF)\n            that was not articulated well enough to appropriately\n            measure its outcome. Lack of well-defined outcome indicators\n            can hamper capturing the impacts accurately and may lead to\n            unfair evaluation of its performance. Investing in\n            developing a robust RF at entry is essential not only for\n            evaluation but also to ensure that the project is on the\n            right track. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that a\n            rigorous mixed methods IE is carried out."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Kapit-Bisig Laban Sa\n            Kahirapan-Comprehensive and

The program aims to achieve this by\n            providing resources to poor rural municipalities to invest\n            in public goods and by reviving local institutions to\n            enhance people's participation in governance.\n            KALAHI-CIDSS was originally targeted at the poorest 25\n            percent of municipalities in 42 of the poorest provinces in\n            the Philippines. KALAHI-CIDSS was designed to minimize the\n            risk of elite capture and it appears to have been successful\n            in doing so. The project had a positive impact on household\n            consumption. Consistent with the project development\n            objective, KALAHI-CIDSS led to an increase in participation\n            in barangay assemblies, associated with greater knowledge\n            about the barangay's income and expenses. The project\n            led to improvements in basic service delivery.
