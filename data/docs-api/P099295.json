Some\n            lessons learned included: building and instilling a sense of\n            ownership within the government will increase likelihood of\n            project success. It is essential to identify and provide\n            support to a champion within the counterpart team who can\n            lead efforts and push forward with implementation. Building\n            capacity of the counterparts is essential to satisfactory\n            levels of implementation. Flexibility in implementation and\n            the ability to adapt to local market conditions is essential\n            to overcoming unexpected implementation challenges.\n            Intensifying
