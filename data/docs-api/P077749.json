These four operations were\n            undertaken within a period of less than four years. The\n            first two credits were independent operations which were\n            intended to prepare for a series of Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credits (PRSCs), and the last two operations were\n            part of a projected series of three PRSC operations. The\n            overall rating of the ERSC is highly satisfactory in\n            Implementation Completion Report (ICR'S) rating; and\n            the overall outcome of the ESAC, PRSC I, and PRSC II is\n            rated satisfactory in ICR rating; and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower for all four projects is rated as\n            satisfactory. The main lessons of the review as follows: (i)\n            budget support and other program assistance need to be\n            undertaken within a medium-term policy framework. This\n            lesson was learned from the first two operations prior to\n            the PRSC program; (ii) complementary investment or capacity\n            building projects may be critical to the effectiveness of\n            direct budget support through a PRSC; (iii) successful\n            programmatic budget support through PRSCs requires careful\n            preparation. Prior analytical work and policy dialogue are\n            needed to prevent misunderstandings and inconsistent\n            expectations; and (iv) direct budget support is high-risk.\n            It is vulnerable to sudden loss of political support from\n            bilateral donors and is no less subject to sudden\n            termination than policy-based lending."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia

Operations\n            Project were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            strength of the PRSC instrument in addressing a wide-range\n            of cross-cutting themes can also be its greatest weakness if\n            such a program needs to be prematurely terminated for any\n            reason. Government ownership is crucial for proper design,\n            implementation and results. Quality time and effort put into\n            project formulation and preparation can put a project on a\n            sound footing and minimize the need for mid-course\n            corrections. Resources committed to ESW can strongly\n            underpin project design and facilitate better\n            implementation, especially where data on baseline conditions\n            are inadequate to begin with. A project's scope and\n            content should be matched well with the commitment and\n            capacity displayed by the borrower. The Bank should retain\n            the option of reducing the quantum of a DPL prior to\n            effectiveness, if performance falls considerably short of\n            initially and mutually agreed levels. Finally, where reform\n            in vital area is slow, the Bank should continue to be\n            engaged and serve as a facilitator."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - First and Second Poverty\n

Programmatic financing instrument such as the Poverty\n            Reduction Support Operations (PRSC) were strong. First, the\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process is sound\n            with a strategy that is appropriate in terms of both growth\n            and poverty reduction impact, grounded in the MDGs, backed\n            by strong country-ownership, and a credible implementation\n            process. Second, the budget process is credible, with\n            continuous efforts underway to improve the predictability of\n            resource flows to sub-national levels responsible for\n            primary service delivery and reduce the reporting lags on\n            actual expenditures. Third, although decentralization has\n            placed strains on the public financial management system,\n            fiduciary performance is acceptable and measures are being\n            implemented to address identified weaknesses. Fourth, the\n            Bank and other partners have supported a strong analytical\n            program in Ethiopia involving several Public Expenditure\n            Reviews (PERs), a Country Financial Accountability\n            Assessment (CFAA), Country Procurement Assessment Report\n            (CPAR), Risk and Vulnerability Assessment, poverty analyses,\n            diagnostics in various sectors, etc. which identified key\n            development constraints which are at the heart of the\n            Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program's\n            (SDPRP's) reform program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Second Poverty Reduction Support Operation"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Second Poverty\n            Reduction Support Operation"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/11/5295949/ethiopia-second-poverty-reduction-support-operation","projn":"ET-Prsc 2 Dpl (Fy05) -- P077749","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Poverty Assessment,Governance Indicators,Achieving Shared Growth","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Ethiopia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20041108095231"},"subsc":"General public administration sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","owner":"AFT: Human Development 3 (AFTH3)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Poverty Reduction Support Credit"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF051119-PHRD-ETHIOPIA: POVERTY\n            REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT (PRSC1),TF053809-PHRD-ETHIOPIA: POVERTY\n            REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT II","repnb":"29772"},"5466241":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/09/5466241/ethiopia-second-poverty-reduction-support-operation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/09/5466241/ethiopia-second-poverty-reduction-support-operation-project","new_url":"2004/09/5466241/ethiopia-second-poverty-reduction-support-operation-project","disclosure_date":"2004-12-03T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2004-12-03T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2004-12-03T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/12/02/000104615_20041203135406/Rendered/INDEX/ET0PRSC0II0PID010120120041AB1080.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/12/02/000104615_20041203135406/Rendered/PDF/ET0PRSC0II0PID010120120041AB1080.pdf","credit_no":"H135","docdt":"2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2004-12-03T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Initial appraisal","versiontyp_key":"1309945","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Second Poverty Reduction Support\n            Operation Project"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Second Poverty Reduction Support\n            Operation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Second Poverty\n            Reduction Support Operation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/09/5466241/ethiopia-second-poverty-reduction-support-operation-project","projn":"ET-Prsc 2 Dpl (Fy05) -- P077749","docty":"Program Information Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,National Governance,Poverty Assessment,Governance Indicators,Achieving Shared Growth","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction,Governance","count":"Ethiopia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000104615_20041203135406"},"subsc":"General public administration sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction,Governance","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","owner":"AFT: Human Development 3 (AFTH3)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Development Policy Lending"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF051119-PHRD-ETHIOPIA: POVERTY\n            REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT (PRSC1),TF053809-PHRD-ETHIOPIA: POVERTY\n            REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT II","repnb":"AB1080"},"facets":{}}}
