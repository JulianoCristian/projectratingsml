However, institutional development\n            impact, was only modest, since inter-departmental\n            coordination, particularly between central, and local\n            governments, as well as with community groups is still weak,\n            even though improvements are underway to strengthen\n            community participation. Lessons address first, general\n            issues for project implementation, such as the need to\n            increase women participation in urban neighborhood\n            management, to warrant a review in the provision of\n            micro-credit within urban areas, and, to provide continuous\n            assistance adjustments in urban management. Second, the use\n            of funds to lease solid waste collection vehicles, is a\n            practical way to increase private sector development, and\n            should be evaluated. Similarly, acquisition of laboratory\n            equipment, and personnel training in environmental\n            protection, and pollution control should include civil\n            society, and, drainage management should enforce guidelines\n            to improve severe flooding. Third, specific Bank lessons,\n            suggest the need for a less prescriptive approach for\n            community-based development projects, rather focused on\n            implementing objectives, and deeper recognition between\n            environment, and health. However, support to\n            performance-oriented maintenance management systems, should\n            not be supported, until completion of brief analyses on\n            previous activities, to establish clear objectives for\n            future activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
