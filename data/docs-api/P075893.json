Some lessons learned included: the quality\n            of dialogue and pro-activity in the advice provided to the\n            borrower are essential to the success of an operation.\n            During ECAL IV, the team did an excellent job managing the\n            dialogue and offering the needed advice to the Tunisian\n            authorities for the implementation of the reform agenda\n            supported by the loan. This was particularly complex given\n            the fact that this project was implemented in partnership\n            with the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the European\n            Union. In addition, the excellent partnership and\n            coordination between the Bank, the AfDB and the European\n            Union (EU) make this project a best practice with respect to\n            donor coordination. In future operations, further attention\n            should give to the results framework. Coherence between the\n            original program development objectives (PDO) and the\n            indicators is essential to an accurate measure of the work\n            accomplished. In the case of ECAL IV, baseline and progress\n            data was not collected prior to the implementation\n            completion report (ICR) mission for some indicators.\n            Therefore the data appears to be collected more in order to\n            comply with a requirement than motivated by a strong focus\n            on impact and results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Fourth
