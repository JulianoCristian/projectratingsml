The sector objectives at the start of the program\n            were to strengthen further Office national des\n            telecommunications (ONATEL)'s ability to: (a) increase\n            operational efficiency and quality of service; (b) ensure\n            that revenues would cover operating costs and contribute\n            significantly to investments; (c) generate tax revenues for\n            Government; (d) extend services to rural areas; and (e)\n            expand facilities to meet expressed demand. In spite of the\n            difficult environment, the performance of both the Borrower\n            and the Bank in implementing the project was generally\n            satisfactory, as the objectives have mainly been attained.\n            The project outcome is satisfactory, though its rural\n            network component was only partially implemented. The key\n            lessons learned are as follows: (a) In a developing country\n            with a high risk of economic and political turmoil,\n            supervision missions should be unfailingly as frequent as\n            twice a year to guide the implementation of the project.\n            (b) Technical assistance has to be focused selectively and\n            delivered in such a way that it can be absorbed with regards\n            to the skills, size and availability (risk of turnover) of\n            the staff of the entity, in order to avoid waste and\n            frustration. (c) The audit requirement is an excellent\n            covenant, provided the Bank enforce the recommendations\n            flagged by the auditors to remedy accounts deficiencies, or\n            decide to suspend the credit, even if difficult\n            circumstances make it necessary to carry the supervision in\n            a neighboring country but it should be qualified to demand\n            that the entity remedy the deficiencies flagged by the\n            auditors, through its own staff or external help. d) The\n            institutional dialogue should take into account the country\n            realities and the sustainability of any proposed liberalized scheme."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi -
