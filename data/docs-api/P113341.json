Some lessons\n            learned included:  project design was successful in engaging\n            multiple stakeholders and creating a sense of ownership of\n            the project. It created a momentum to strengthen\n            stakeholders\u2019 commitment to improve quality of health\n            professional\u2019s education. The process to set accreditation\n            and competence-base examination are lengthy and depend on\n            the existing legal and institutional framework.\n            Additionally, the political economy of transferring the\n            authority (accreditation) from the government to\n            non-government entities is challenging and requires a very\n            long and difficult change process. In future similar\n            operations, consideration should be given on the selection\n            of KPIs to take into account lengthy political and legal\n            processes. For the Financial Assistance Package (FAP) the\n            comparison of mean test between FAP recipients and non-FAP\n            recipients are not useful to monitor implementation and\n
