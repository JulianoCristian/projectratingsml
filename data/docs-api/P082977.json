The Bank\u2019s efforts\n            helped extend 4.7 million micro-loans with a 78 percent\n            return on investment (RoI). The economic rate of return\n            (ERR) on infrastructure sub-projects was 23.8 percent.\n            129,000 children (more than half of them girls) enrolled in\n            schools; and the project also supported the reconstruction\n            of 110,534 completely destroyed houses and 10,000 partially\n            damaged houses were restored. The project trained 17,475\n            skilled laborers and restored 676 damaged community\n            infrastructure schemes in earthquake-affected areas.

Second Poverty Alleviation Fund Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Second Poverty\n            Alleviation Fund Project for Pakistan were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: the strong performance of Pakistan Poverty\n            Alleviation Fund (PPAF) and its achievement of most target\n            indicators provide significant evidence that the approach\n            used for PPAF-2 is appropriate and effective in the context\n            of Pakistan. An emerging need for PPAF is to combine various\n            stand-alone databases and the Social Mobilization Component\n            (SMC) Management Information System (MIS) to an effective\n            integrated MIS that will allow more rapid updating and\n            retrieval of key data and analysis. For such a system to be\n            efficient, it should be effectively linked with the\n            web-based data entry system now in use by several Partner\n            Organizations (Pos). Inclusion of a Geographical Information\n            System (GIS) with the coordinates of interventions will be\n            useful for effective monitoring and reporting. Community\n            participation through cash or labor contribution, managing\n            their own finances, and procuring materials and equipment\n            ensured strong community ownership of Small Scale\n            Infrastructure Project (SSIPs) and Small Scale Development\n            Project (SSDPs). Such experiences in managing a complete\n            project cycle approach gives voice to the poor, creates a\n            path for community members to increase self-confidence and\n            demonstrate that the poor, marginalized, and women can make\n            a difference. An assessment is recommended of the risks and\n            benefits associated with the PPAF approach to health and\n            education where recurrent costs are partially met through\n            PPAF funding. While there is some initial evidence of a\n            successful transition to sustainable financing (either\n            through corporate sponsorship or beneficiary contributions),\n            more options need to be explored for their long term sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second Poverty Alleviation Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Second

incidence of poverty\n            in the country through provision of resources and services\n            to the poor, especially women. The additional financing for\n            social mobilization enables key PPAF partner Organizations\n            (POs) to expand their social mobilization programs to cover\n            an additional one million poor rural households in 25 of the\n            poorest districts of the country and provide a foundation\n            for the expansion of Pakistan's poverty reduction\n            agenda through PPAF and the PPAF-III project. PPAF's\n            POs will mobilize approximately 50,000 Community\n            Organizations (COs), which federate at union council levels,\n            to form Local Support Organizations (LSO), and higher level\n            in order to access public and private development resources\n            and services and to link communities more effectively to\n            local government and the private sector.

Pakistan has a\n            population of over 162 million, with over 60 percent living\n            in rural areas. Rising food prices, the energy crisis, and\n            other inflationary pressures have not only pushed more\n            people below the poverty line, but have increased\n            vulnerability of the ultra-poor to an unprecedented level.\n            The rising levels of ethnic and religious strife, conflict\n            and insecurity, and recurring natural calamities have\n            further limited the country\u2019s capacity to deal effectively\n            with persistent poverty. The International Development\n            Association financed Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund\n            (PPAF) in 1999 to support government efforts to empower poor\n            people to achieve sustainable livelihoods. The objective was\n            to increase their incomes, improve their productive\n            capacity, and provide them better access to services. The\n            project facilitated the formation of inclusive community\n            groups, with the aim of increasing economic activity, skills\n            enhancement, asset base, infrastructure access, and market\n            linkages. The third PPAF (PPAF III) project was launched in\n            2009, built on successful PPAF experiences and further\n            targeted marginalized groups of the most vulnerable and\n            poorest households, including women. PPAF III promoted\n            stronger community institutions, particularly their ability\n            to manage their own development and to access services.\n            Access to social and physical infrastructure were fully\n            integrated to maximize the impact on poverty. Furthermore,\n            there was a major effort to provide increased occupational\n            skills training, with the goal of spurring exponential\n            growth in micro-enterprises."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Rural communities push back poverty"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Rural communities push\n            back poverty"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2009/09/25137046/pakistan-rural-communities-push-back-poverty","count":"Pakistan","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Health and other social services,Finance,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"skills, sanitation, communities,\n            micro-credit, rural producers, community institutions,\n            poverty line, farmland, impact on poverty, villages, skills\n            training, teachers, schools, income poverty, income, gender,\n            education services, homes, community organizations, groups,\n            rural access, information, services, rural poverty, incomes,\n            micro- finance institutions, health, poor people,\n            malnutrition, rural, projects, project, habitat, gender\n            disparities, market, access to markets, rural poor,\n            conflict, literacy, land, education, drinking water,\n            investment, rural households, irrigation, participatory\n            development, training, micro- finance, households, access to\n            services, rural areas, poverty, clean water, livelihood\n            opportunities, access to health facilities, community\n            groups, facilities, girls, students, houses, funding,\n            markets, poor rural households, drainage, livelihoods, poor,\n            community, women, research, food prices, history, rural\n            roads, female, districts, poverty alleviation, human development"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Financial Intermediary Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Financial and private sector development","projn":"PK-Second Poverty Alleviation Fund Project\n            -- P082977,PK-Poverty Alleviation Fund -- P049791","topic":"Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Poverty m1326687 695,Poverty and Social Impact Analysis\n            m1327421 709,Monitoring and Evaluation Systems m1326029 1156,Inequality and Shared Prosperity m1327655 700,Evidence-Based Policy m1326939 706","subtopic":"Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Primary Education,Rural Poverty Reduction,Housing & Human Habitats","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Rural Development,Education","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b083135b9a_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","theme":"Urban services and housing for the poor,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Gender,Rural markets,Improving labor markets,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Urban services and housing for the poor,Rural services and infrastructure,Gender","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Rural Development,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Poverty m1326687 695,Poverty and Social Impact Analysis\n            m1327421 709,Monitoring and Evaluation Systems m1326029 1156,Inequality and Shared Prosperity m1327655 700,Evidence-Based Policy m1326939 706","owner":"Finance & Markets - GP - IBRD (GFMDR)","trustfund":"TF023107-PHRD-FINANCIAL SEC.
