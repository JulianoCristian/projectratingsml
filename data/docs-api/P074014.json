These four operations were\n            undertaken within a period of less than four years. The\n            first two credits were independent operations which were\n            intended to prepare for a series of Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credits (PRSCs), and the last two operations were\n            part of a projected series of three PRSC operations. The\n            overall rating of the ERSC is highly satisfactory in\n            Implementation Completion Report (ICR'S) rating; and\n            the overall outcome of the ESAC, PRSC I, and PRSC II is\n            rated satisfactory in ICR rating; and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower for all four projects is rated as\n            satisfactory. The main lessons of the review as follows: (i)\n            budget support and other program assistance need to be\n            undertaken within a medium-term policy framework. This\n            lesson was learned from the first two operations prior to\n            the PRSC program; (ii) complementary investment or capacity\n            building projects may be critical to the effectiveness of\n            direct budget support through a PRSC; (iii) successful\n            programmatic budget support through PRSCs requires careful\n            preparation. Prior analytical work and policy dialogue are\n            needed to prevent misunderstandings and inconsistent\n            expectations; and (iv) direct budget support is high-risk.\n            It is vulnerable to sudden loss of political support from\n            bilateral donors and is no less subject to sudden\n            termination than policy-based lending."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia

Operations\n            Project were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            strength of the PRSC instrument in addressing a wide-range\n            of cross-cutting themes can also be its greatest weakness if\n            such a program needs to be prematurely terminated for any\n            reason. Government ownership is crucial for proper design,\n            implementation and results. Quality time and effort put into\n            project formulation and preparation can put a project on a\n            sound footing and minimize the need for mid-course\n            corrections. Resources committed to ESW can strongly\n            underpin project design and facilitate better\n            implementation, especially where data on baseline conditions\n            are inadequate to begin with. A project's scope and\n            content should be matched well with the commitment and\n            capacity displayed by the borrower. The Bank should retain\n            the option of reducing the quantum of a DPL prior to\n            effectiveness, if performance falls considerably short of\n            initially and mutually agreed levels. Finally, where reform\n            in vital area is slow, the Bank should continue to be\n            engaged and serve as a facilitator."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - First and Second Poverty\n

      implementation of the SDPRP by: strengthening the focus on\n            planning and budgeting processes; stabilizing the public\n            sector during a period of rapid state transformation in\n            order to maintain pro-poor expenditures; and improving the\n            investment climate (including for the rural sector). The\n            Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            (SDPRP's) goals, objectives and strategies were set in\n            the context of a decade of progress in economic performance\n            and poverty reduction. Following the collapse of the Derg\n            regime, structural reforms began in the early 1990s. Foreign\n            exchange markets were liberalized and the birr was devalued,\n            bringing a 50% depreciation in the real exchange rate.\n            Initial emphasis was placed on the agriculture sector, where\n            reforms reversed the heavy burden of implicit taxes on the\n            rural economy. Restrictions on grain traders were relaxed\n            and then lifted, food delivery quotas on farmers were\n            lifted, whilst restrictions on agricultural input markets\n            were lowered and seed and fertilizer availability increased\n            dramatically. Farmgate prices for tradeables improved,\n            productivity increased, and production expanded. Progress\n            was also made in improving the efficiency of tax policy and\n            in lowering customs tariffs. Privatization reforms began,\n            and a homegrown civil service reform program - comprising\n            expenditure and human resource managements reforms as well\n            as initiatives in performance improvement and ethics - was\n            launched to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of\n            Ethiopia's nascent federal system. Growth in the reform\n            period since 1992/3 averaged 5.8% per annum, implying\n            historically high per capita GDP growth of about 2.8% per\n            year. Growth in the early days of the reform period came\n            from an increase in private consumption, was spread quite\n            evenly across the agricultural, industrial and service\n            sectors and was spurred on by substantial improvements in\n            food production."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - First Poverty Reduction Support\n            Operation
