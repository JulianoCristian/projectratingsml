The project achieved most of its objectives,\n            its impact on institutional development was modest, and\n            sustainability is likely. However, the performance of both\n            the Bank and Borrower was marginally satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, future\n            credits should be reinforced by systematic sector reforms\n            that specifically address the elements jeopardizing PFIs\n            soundness. Second, the Bank and GOP should develop and\n            support financial sector policy reforms that will provide\n            the sector with the right incentive framework. Third, in the\n            case of financial intermediary operations, successful\n            project implementation depends on careful monitoring of the\n            PFIs and close supervision of subprojects as soon as\n            problems arise. Fourth, the market determination of interest\n            rates is an essential element of competition and efficiency\n            in the financial sector. Finally, the quantity and quality\n            of an economy's industrial investment are critical in\n            terms of its growth and efficiency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second Industrial Investment\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Second Industrial\n            Investment Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/06/734223/pakistan-second-industrial-investment-credit-project","projn":"PK-Indus.
