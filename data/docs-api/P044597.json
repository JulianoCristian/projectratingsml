The lessons learned indicate that experience\n            with biodiversity projects also indicates the importance of\n            facilitating biodiversity conservation activities by\n            communities or groups of people who have a vital interest in\n            conservation, either because their livelihoods depend\n            directly on biological resources, or because their quality\n            of life depends significantly on use and existence values of\n            biodiversity. Brazukuab Biodiversity Fund (FUNBIO's)\n            design reflected learning from the earliest generation of\n            GEF supported trust funds for biodiversity conservation. A\n            lesson identified in GEF's global portfolio of trust\n            funds was that trust funds can promote decreases in\n            government funding of protected areas by substituting trust\n            fund financing for regular appropriations. At the time the\n            project was designed, there was an expectation that the\n            companion project would support definition of clear\n            priorities and targets for biodiversity conservation\n            outcomes, and that FUNBIO would incorporate the objectives,\n            indicators, and measurement systems related to those\n            outcomes into the monitoring and evaluation system for its\n            own projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -

The project will\n            include the following components: 1) biodiversity\n            assessments and dissemination, which will include a\n            biodiversity information network; 2) model biodiversity\n            sub-projects; and 3) project administration.

The project will have two\n            major components: 1) strengthening and operational support\n            of FUNBIO, which will include operational costs, development\n            of a cost-recovery and fund-raising program, and special\n            studies to strengthen FUNBIO; and 2) grants program that\n            will finance FUNBIO sub-projects. The sub-projects will be\n            selected on a competitive basis according to established\n            criteria. The nature of the sub-projects will include the\n            following four broad areas: (a) biodiversity conservation;\n            (b) sustainable use of biodiversity; (c) policy analysis;\n            and (d) applied research and technology development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - National Biodiversity and Brazilian\n            Biodiversity Fund Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - National Biodiversity\n            and Brazilian Biodiversity Fund Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/03/441901/brazil-national-biodiversity-brazilian-biodiversity-fund-projects","projn":"BR-National Biodiversity Project - Probio\n            (Gef) -- P006210,BR-Brazilian Biodiversity Fund - Funbio\n            (Gef) -- P044597","subtopic":"Biodiversity,Wetlands,Natural Resources Management,Environmental Management,Energy and Environment","docty":"GEF Project Document","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101911493248"},"subsc":"Central government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1996","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absorptive\n            capacity,Agriculture,amphibians,Biodiversity,Biodiversity\n            Assessments,biodiversity conservation,biodiversity\n            monitoring,biodiversity protection,Biodiversity\n            Strategy,Biological Diversity,Biome,birds,climate,climate\n            zones,Conservation,conservation activities,conservation of\n            biological diversity,deforestation,Demonstration\n            Projects,Ecology,ecosystem,ecosystems,ecotourism,endemic\n            species,Environmental Aspects,environmental\n            management,environmental protection,environmental protection\n            agency,environmental sustainability,fauna,flora,forest\n            ecosystems,forests,Genetic Resources,Geographic\n            Information,Geographic Information Systems,GIS,GLOBAL\n            ENVIRONMENT,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY,Global Environment\n            Facility Trust Fund,global warming,habitat,habitat\n            protection,habitats,income,international Biodiversity,loss\n            of biodiversity,mammals,marine ecosystems,National\n            Biodiversity,natural ecosystems,natural resource\n            management,Natural Resources,Nature,ozone,ozone\n            layer,parks,plant species,Renewable Natural\n            Resources,Restoration,scrub,species richness,Sustainable\n            Development,sustainable use,sustainable use of\n            biodiversity,sustainable use of biological\n            diversity,variety,vascular plants,vegetation,Water Resources,wetlands,Wildlife"},"1":{"cdata!":"absorptive\n            capacity,Agriculture,amphibians,Biodiversity,Biodiversity\n            Assessments,biodiversity conservation,biodiversity\n            monitoring,biodiversity protection,Biodiversity\n            Strategy,Biological Diversity,Biome,birds,climate,climate\n            zones,Conservation,conservation activities,conservation of\n            biological diversity,deforestation,Demonstration\n            Projects,Ecology,ecosystem,ecosystems,ecotourism,endemic\n            species,Environmental Aspects,environmental\n            management,environmental protection,environmental protection\n            agency,environmental sustainability,fauna,flora,forest\n            ecosystems,forests,Genetic Resources,Geographic\n            Information,Geographic Information Systems,GIS,GLOBAL\n            ENVIRONMENT,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY,Global Environment\n            Facility Trust Fund,global warming,habitat,habitat\n            protection,habitats,income,international Biodiversity,loss\n            of biodiversity,mammals,marine ecosystems,National\n            Biodiversity,natural ecosystems,natural resource\n            management,Natural Resources,Nature,ozone,ozone\n            layer,parks,plant species,Renewable Natural\n            Resources,Restoration,scrub,species richness,Sustainable\n            Development,sustainable use,sustainable use of\n            biodiversity,sustainable use of biological\n            diversity,variety,vascular plants,vegetation,Water Resources,wetlands,Wildlife"}},"owner":"Environment (LCSEN)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF028309-GEF1-BRAZIL NATIONAL\n            BIODIVERSITY PROJECT,TF028310-GEF1-BRAZILIAN BIODIVERSITY\n            FUND PROJECT,TF028659-GET-PPA BRAZIL NAT'L\n            BIODIVERSITY PROJ.","repnb":"14523"},"facets":{}}}
