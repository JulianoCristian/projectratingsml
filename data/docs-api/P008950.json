Some of the\n            lessons learned from the project are: 1) investment projects\n            that are heavily focused on physical components, fail to\n            address the root causes of the problems facing the sector.\n            Greater focus on institutional and policy issues when these\n            stand in the way of efficiency is warranted; 2) the use of\n            country and sector-specific disbursement profiles would\n            result in a more realistic implementation period for any\n            irrigation project; 3) the availability and reliability of\n            water supply has to be critically assessed at appraisal and\n            the command area sized accordingly, to avoid situations\n            similar to Eregli; 4) delays in project implementation can\n            be curtailed by closer cooperation and coordination between\n            participating agencies, but this requires developing\n            appropriate arrangements during preparation; 6)\n            establishment of Water Users Organization (WUOs) and making\n            them responsible for management, is a major positive step\n            for assuring the sustainability of an irrigation project; 7)\n            creation of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) unit in\n            General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) and\n            expansion of its existing environmental unit would\n            contribute substantially to a quality analysis of the impact\n            and to the planning of irrigation schemes; and 8) the\n            measurement of irrigation efficiencies is vital to assess\n            the performance of irrigation schemes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
