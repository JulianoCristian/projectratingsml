Ratings for the National Rural Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Project for Peru were as follows: outcomes\n            were unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            high, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: strong focus on project outcomes and\n            adequate accountability mechanisms are key factors to the\n            achievement of significant improvements in service\n            provision. Efforts to replicate successful experiences from\n            other contexts must carefully take into account the\n            receptivity of the implementing institutions and\n            beneficiaries. Conserving water resources through demand and\n            supply management can yield quick benefits to liberate water\n            resources for new clients. Project design needs to address\n            gaps and weaknesses in sector institutions and governance\n            identified during project preparation, failing which the\n            risk to achieving project outcomes and timely implementation\n            is much increased. The modalities of cost-sharing and\n            community participation need to be adapted to the local\n            context and supplementary resources made available as\n            needed. Community participation in planning and operations\n            underpins sustainability, but adequate training support,\n            financial incentives, and contractual arrangements are\n            necessary for continued and effective participation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Lima Water Rehabilitation and\n            Management Project and National Rural Water Supply\n            andSanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Lima Water Rehabilitation\n            and Management Project and National Rural Water Supply\n            andSanitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2016/06/26595341/peru-lima-water-rehabilitation-management-project-national-rural-water-supply-andsanitation-project","topic":"Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water m1326522 137,Water Allocation and Water Supply m1326747 1063,Energy Efficiency in Water and Wastewater\n            Utilities m1327706 1197,Water Demand Management m1326746 1064","projn":"PE-National Rural Water Supply And\n            Sanitation Project -- P065256,PE-Lima Water Rehabilit & Mgt.

Some lessons\n            learned included: global experience demonstrates that\n            projects that build significant and complex infrastructure\n            such as this one take on average almost ten years to\n            implement successfully. The Bank should take this into\n            consideration when designing operations in the sector, as\n            shorter execution periods could impede the achievement of\n            desired outcomes. The presentation of the condominial system\n            to the potential beneficiaries by the social promoters was\n            very important for a successful implementation since this\n            system represented a new way of doing business for Lima\n            Water and Sewerage Public Company (SEDAPAL), so there were\n            many doubts about its quality and costs from both the\n            company and the beneficiaries at the beginning of each civil\n            work package. The involvement of the beneficiaries during\n            the design and implementation phases through the formation\n            of Water and Sanitation Committee (WSC) as well as through\n            workshops organized by social promoters was a key feature in\n            the development of this system, as it helped to empower the\n            beneficiaries and will contribute to sustain an adequate\n            operation and maintenance of the system in the long-term.\n            SEDAPAL formal legal recognition of the WSC once the civil\n            works are completed and the systems are in operation will\n            help them further fulfill their role during the operation\n            phase and prevent the disappearance or dismantling of this\n            important community structure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Lima Water Rehabilitation and\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Lima Water Rehabilitation\n            and Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/09/11215026/peru-lima-water-rehabilitation-management-project","projn":"PE-Lima Water Rehabilit & Mgt.

The project will promote water\n            conservation, support the Lima Water and Sewerage Service\n            Company's (SEDAPAL's) privatization, rehabilitate\n            damaged water supply and sewerage systems, expand services\n            to the urban poor in the pueblos jovenes, and support\n            reforms in the legal and institutional framework of the\n            water and sanitation sector. The project has four\n            components. The water conservation component includes\n            preparing a customer cadastre, reconstructing water meter\n            boxes, and installing 406,000 water meters. This component\n            will also initiate conjunctive use of surface and\n            groundwater in three districts where groundwater is depleted\n            and the risk of saline contamination is serious. The\n            rehabilitation component will improve water supply and\n            sewerage in the twelve districts that comprise 40 percent of\n            SEDAPAL's water sales and 75 percent of total revenue.\n            Wells will also be rehabilitated under this component. The\n            pueblos jovenes component will expand and improve water and\n            sanitation services for 600,000 of Lima's poor.
