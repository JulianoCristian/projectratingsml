Some lessons learned\n            included: a decentralized, rural Community-Driven\n            Development (CDD) project in a very poor state with issues\n            of institutional capacity at all levels and geographic\n            dispersion may not be the best vehicle for introducing\n            results-based management and similarly challenging\n            activities involving complex vertical and horizontal\n            linkages. While the Northeast CDD projects have, since\n            inception, been vehicles for the successful piloting and\n            scaling up of innovation, not all participating states have\n            equal capacity to host innovation successfully. Innovation\n            also needs consistent commitment and full understanding and\n            buy-in of all stakeholders. Decentralized, community-based\n            projects with broad geographic coverage require more\n            frequent, technical and specialized missions including\n            fiduciary and safeguard specialists. Other Northeast rural\n            poverty reduction projects are now focusing much more on\n            productive investments which have specialized technical and\n            operational requirements. The ability of supervision\n            missions to finance the inclusion of specialists is critical\n            to the success of such activities, including via the\n            training opportunity they can provide to state technical\n            units for analyzing, approving and overseeing implementation\n            of such subprojects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Maranhao Integrated

Public awareness campaigns should\n            disseminate information on the implementation of the\n            program, taking into account language diversity, cultural\n            heritage, and traditional ways of life, in order to\n            facilitate access to communal benefits. Nongovernmental\n            organizations, and experienced organizations in indigenous\n            matters, shall survey community requirements in a\n            participatory approach, to comply with the state, and\n            municipal development plans, and define/prioritize the\n            communities' demands. Capacity building, and training\n            shall be provided for community management, organizational\n            skills, and for agricultural productivity activities, among\n            others. Such training shall focus on empowering communities\n            towards managing their own subprojects, in the areas of food\n            products, infrastructure development that complement\n            education, and health activities; and, basic infrastructure\n            - water supply and sanitation, electricity, and improved\n            transportation modes, - and, support for the promotion of\n            cultural activities. Monitoring criteria should ensure\n            compliance with the guidelines, as set forth in this document."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Maranhao Integrated Rural\n            Development Project : indigenous peoples plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Maranhao Integrated\n            Rural Development Project : indigenous peoples plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/10/2896125/brazil-maranhao-integrated-rural-development-project-indigenous-peoples-plan","projn":"BR-Maranhao Integrated Program: Rural\n            Poverty Reduction Project -- P080830","docty":"Indigenous Peoples Plan","count":"Brazil","authors":{"authr":"Brazil"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040211152537"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","lang":"Portuguese","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Indigenous populations; Ethnic groups;\n            Community participation; Capacity building; Technical\n            assistance; Socioeconomic conditions; Public awareness;\n            Social structure; Income generation; Subprojects;\n            Infrastructure development; Monitoring criteria; Grievance\n            mechanisms; Cultural aspects of economic development;\n            Training assistance; Agricultural productivity;\n            Nongovernmental organizations; Food production; Social\n            sector investment; Water supply & sanitation;\n            Electricity; Transportation systems; Monitoring criteria;"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"IPP66"},"2895997":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/09/2895997/brazil-maranhao-integrated-rural-development-project-environmental-assessment","available_in":"Portuguese","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/09/2895997/brazil-maranhao-integrated-rural-development-project-environmental-assessment","new_url":"2003/09/2895997/brazil-maranhao-integrated-rural-development-project-environmental-assessment","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/11/000012009_20040211143800/Rendered/INDEX/E81501PAPER.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/11/000012009_20040211143800/Rendered/PDF/E81501PAPER.pdf","datestored":"2004-02-11T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2003-09-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Maranhao Integrated Rural\n            Development Project : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Maranhao Integrated Rural\n            Development Project aims at reducing rural poverty by\n            financing investments (subprojects), and strengthening\n            community organizations, as well as through the integration\n            of sustainable environmental actions. To this end,\n            subprojects will be identified, and selected in accordance\n            with their capacity to generate income, and employment\n            through protective environmental conservation actions.\n            Notwithstanding the environmental nature of this project,\n            this environmental assessment stipulates the following\n            mitigation measures. Capacity building will be provided for\n            adequate technical practices on the use of agricultural\n            machinery, and conservation measures for soil preparation,\n            as it concerns crop sowing, and harvesting. Subprojects\n            concerning agroindustries, should consider its site location\n            at considerable distance from rivers or natural water flows\n            to minimize water pollution, and in areas with adequate\n            wastewater drainage, while the use of septic tanks, and\n            fencing the perimeter should be further considered. The use\n            of compost from residues should be practiced, in addition to\n            biodegradable substances, and organic residues'\n            transformation processes for soil preparation as needed.\n            Solid wastes should be collected, and disposed of at\n            selected landfills, or recycled as possible as per standards\n            regulations. Management of irrigation systems should take\n            into consideration minimal water requirements, to protect\n            aquatic ecosystems, and, minimize detours on natural river\n            flows, to include as well regulatory measures for the\n            sustainable use of groundwater. Crop storage requires the\n            use of appropriate tanks, located at considerable distance\n            from river, and water flows. Finally, livestock management\n            practices should consider \"rotation\" pastures\n            controlling the number of animals, for vegetative, and soil\n            preservation purposes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Maranhao Integrated Rural\n            Development Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Maranhao Integrated\n            Rural Development Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/09/2895997/brazil-maranhao-integrated-rural-development-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"BR-Maranhao Integrated Program: Rural\n            Poverty Reduction Project -- P080830","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Brazil","authors":{"authr":"Souza Costa Neves, Estela Maria"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040211143800"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","lang":"Portuguese","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Rural development; Agricultural extension;\n            Capacity building; Agricultural technical cooperation; Soil\n            conservation; Crop residue management; Crop residues\n            recycling; Water conservation; Water pollution control;\n            Drainage systems; Agroindustries; Septic tanks; Waste\n            disposal sites; Storage tanks; Composting; Aquatic ecology;\n            Irrigation systems; Livestock management; Biodegradation;\n            Organic matter; Grain storage;"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"E815"},"facets":{}}}
