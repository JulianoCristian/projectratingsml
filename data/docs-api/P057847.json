Some lessons learned included:\n            project design should be based on a shared understanding of\n            objectives and outcomes as well as an accurate assessment of\n            local implementation capacity to achieve them. Project\n            design should take into consideration timing requirements if\n            project objectives rely on policy and legal changes, or\n            objectives should be aligned with the existing policies and\n            legal framework if the timeframe is tight. Sustainable\n            natural resource management requires strong beneficiary\n            commitment. Institutional and legal reforms in a sector such\n            as forestry, characterized by multiple conflicting\n            interests, require time and continual oversight. Parallel\n            grant financing from Swedish International Development\n            Cooperation Agency (Sida) was essential to project\n            achievements; however, its monitoring was complex. Donor\n            coordination and collaboration are essential to tackle\n            complex problems such as illegal logging that benefit from\n            harmonizing experiences and funding

Project for\n            Armenia is to adopt sustainable natural resource management\n            practices and to alleviate rural poverty in mountainous\n            areas where degradation is now reaching a critical point.\n            The project will help avert further deterioration of natural\n            resources (soil, water, forest, fishery, and biodiversity)\n            and stabilize incomes in the local communities. There are\n            three project components. The first component focuses on\n            selected micro-catchments. Support will be provided for\n            preparation and implementation of community forest\n            management plans; local assistance initiatives which benefit\n            biodiversity conservation through community small grants;\n            community pasture management; sustainable agricultural\n            practices; community infrastructure and income generation;\n            and development of community institutions. The second\n            component supports rehabilitation, protection, and\n            sustainable management of state forests in the project area;\n            improves the forest sector's institutional, legal, and\n            policy framework; and enhances institutional capacity to\n            monitor and control forest operations. The third component\n            supports measures to improve the role of two key protected\n            areas in the conservation and sustainable use of the\n            region's biodiversity and sustain these improvements;\n            and improves the capacity of the Department of Bio-resources\n            and Land Protection of the Ministry of Nature Protection to\n            meet its

A\n            water balance should be calculated for each micro catchment,\n            and a water quality survey should be carried out to provide\n            a baseline for subsequent monitoring. 6) To develop\n            sustainable provision of wood and tree products, all trees\n            planted sustainable harvesting rates should be calculated\n            and
