This Grant's reform program supports\n            efforts by the Government in the following areas: (i)\n            functioning of agricultural markets with a focus on the\n            establishment of additional auction floors for agricultural\n            products, and having in place a better targeted and more\n            private sector inclusive system of providing fertilizers and\n            seeds to farmers; (ii) improving the business environment\n            through the establishment of a commercial court; (iii)\n            economic governance with a focus on reforms that improve\n            payroll management and external financial accountability of\n            the GoM. The operation draws on a new framework for budget\n            support that has been developed under the leadership of the\n            Government of Malawi (GoM) with six participating donors,\n            including IDA.
