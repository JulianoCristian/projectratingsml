The key lessons are as follows: For technical\n            assistance aimed at sector reforms to succeed, a) strong\n            government support and consistency of project objectives\n            with overall development requirements are critical; b)\n            continuity of project direction and management needs to be\n            ensured; c) project coordination and implementation units\n            need to be carefully staffed, with emphasis on sectoral\n            experience and networking skills; d) favorable macroeconomic\n            conditions are important; and e) the use of United Nations\n            Development Program or other local offices as disbursement\n            agent helps to avoid bureaucratic delays in making project\n            funds available. On the other hand, the project's\n            shortcomings emphasize the need to a) avoid or at least\n            limit the multiplicity of objectives and activities, design\n            the project concept as firmly as feasible at appraisal, and\n            ensure that loan covenants are enforceable; b) make\n            appropriate arrangements for enhanced monitoring of complex\n            projects, including adequate resources for supervision; and\n            c) restrict labor-intensive and less effective types of\n            contracting (e.g., use of individual
