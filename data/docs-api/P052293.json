Lessons are as follows.\n            The project design concept of combining related sub-sectors\n            in a broader sector project worked satisfactorily, in spite\n            of the involvement of five agencies. Keys to success\n            include: an effective multi-agency steering committee,\n            empowered to make project cost and coordination decisions,\n            allowing a balanced coordination between implementing\n            agencies, with the provision that agency representatives\n            were empowered; a Project Management Unit, supplemented by\n            specific project support in each implementing agency, which\n            proved critically important in this multi-agency project,\n            also effective in building capacity due to the line\n            reporting and accountability of each agency for authorizing\n            project expenditures; intensive monitoring and supervision\n            with a good skill mix, from both the Bank and Government;\n            and, well-defined indicators relevant to each agency, and to\n            the project. In addition, the two-phase Adaptable Program\n            Lending (APL) structure worked well from the Project\n            perspective, particularly with respect to the public sector\n            reform activities, the phasing was helpful because of two\n            agencies, whish despite of differing pace and targets from\n            that expected at appraisal, both in the end exceeded\n            targets. The public works experience shows that sector\n            reform can be introduced smoothly when the timing is well\n            chosen - in this case, alignment of a national reform\n            agenda, sector political will, committed executive leader,\n            comprehensive consultations, and a sound, well-designed\n            plan. Notwithstanding, the introduction of hazard risk\n            management into public sector management needs a number of\n            elements to be successful, and, the preparation of fiduciary\n            arrangements such as procurement, and financial management\n            needs to cover the whole transaction cycle in order to\n            streamline the process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Samoa -

- Infrastructure Asset Management\n            Project : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Infrastructure Asset Management\n            Project aims to improve air, road, and coastal transport\n            infrastructure and to support public sector reform and\n            increased private sector participation in the provision of\n            infrastructure. The purpose of this environmental analysis\n            is to identify and assess the environmental issues\n            associated with the project and evaluate the need for\n            further reviews. The airport improvement component may cause\n            spillages from resurfacing materials resulting in pollution\n            of groundwater and the lagoon ecosystem, which will be\n            mitigated by adhering to proper procedures. Road subsector\n            work may bring about dust and/or mud problems during\n            construction. To mitigate such impact, codes of\n            environmental practice will be observed. Under the coastal\n            infrastructure component, groundwater flows to the coast may\n            be inhibited, access to the coast may be curtailed, and\n            lagoon ecosystem may be affected. Mitigation measures\n            include designing coastal protection methods in consultation\n            with the village concerned."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Samoa - Infrastructure Asset Management\n
