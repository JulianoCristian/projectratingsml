Some lessons learned includes: in a country\n            like Morocco, providing access to an all-weather road to the\n            rural population requires first programs to be implemented\n            by the Directorate of roads and its provincial directorates\n            with a priority given to rural roads connecting to the\n            network of classified roads and for the establishment of a\n            platform for planning, designing and implementing rural\n            roads along with an effective monitoring and evaluation\n            system including impact evaluation. Implementing a national\n            investment program requires the establishment of a dedicated\n            and well staff unit at the onset of its launch. An adequate\n            monitoring and evaluation system including well-defined and\n            measurable indicators plays is key role for a successful\n            program. Well stated technical standards are essential to\n            the quality and sustainability of infrastructure\n            investments. The preparation and dissemination a manual for\n            design and appraisal of rural roads projects played a\n            critical role and helped ensure quality and conformity for\n

implementation of a national program of rural roads\n            development and a measure aiming at strengthening the\n            Borrower's institutional capacity. The implementation\n            of the project is progressing well and the change, namely an\n            extension of the closing date will allow finalizing all\n            activities under the project and consequently increase the\n            chances of meeting the development objectives. The Bank and\n            the Borrower have agreed in writing to a specific action\n            plan and a schedule to complete the project within the\n            extension.
