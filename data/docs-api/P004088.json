The Third Small and Medium\n            Industry Bank Project will assist SMIB in its efforts to\n            support the Government's policy of increasing the\n            regional dispersal of employment opportunities and of\n            deepening the industrial structure. It will also assist SMIB\n            in continuing its support of projects which will complement\n            large-scale manufacturing enterprises through extensive\n            subcontracting arrangements. There are no special risks\n            associated with the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Third Small and Medium Industry Bank Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Korea - Third Small and Medium\n            Industry Bank Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1979/05/726641/korea-third-small-medium-industry-bank-project","projn":"KR-Dfc(Smib III) -- P004088","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Municipal Financial Management,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Korea, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912435865"},"subsc":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise-IL","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,assets,Balance Sheets,Bank of\n            Korea,banking services,banking system,Basic\n            metals,bonds,Book value,capacity utilization,capital\n            formation,capital goods,capital loans,Cash Flow\n            Statements,certain extent,chemical\n            industry,cities,coal,collateral,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,competitive\n            advantage,competitiveness,consumers,current\n            prices,debt,deposits,Development Strategy,Dividend\n            payout,Dividend payout ratio,economic activity,Economic\n            Cooperation,economic development,economic\n            performance,Economic Rate of Return,employment,exchange\n            rate,Export growth,Exports,Fair Trade,financial\n            institutions,Financial Performance,financial\n            resources,FINANCIAL SECTOR,Financial Structure,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fixed asset,Fixed capital,Forecasts,Foreign\n            capital,Foreign Currency,Foreign Exchange,free\n            trade,GNP,government regulations,growth potential,growth\n            rate,imports,Income,Income\n            Statements,industrialization,interest rate,Interest\n            Rates,intermediate inputs,inventories,KDB,labor\n            productivity,Legal Framework,market\n            prices,maturities,merchant banks,Monetary Policy,net working\n            capital,oil,oil prices,payout ratio,Portfolio,price\n            controls,producers,productivity,Profitability,real GNP,Real\n            wages,savings,savings associations,Securities,Small\n            Business,technical assistance,time deposits,Transport,value\n            added,wages,wholesale prices,Working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,assets,Balance Sheets,Bank of\n            Korea,banking services,banking system,Basic\n            metals,bonds,Book value,capacity utilization,capital\n            formation,capital goods,capital loans,Cash Flow\n            Statements,certain extent,chemical\n            industry,cities,coal,collateral,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,competitive\n            advantage,competitiveness,consumers,current\n            prices,debt,deposits,Development Strategy,Dividend\n            payout,Dividend payout ratio,economic activity,Economic\n            Cooperation,economic development,economic\n            performance,Economic Rate of Return,employment,exchange\n            rate,Export growth,Exports,Fair Trade,financial\n            institutions,Financial Performance,financial\n            resources,FINANCIAL SECTOR,Financial Structure,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fixed asset,Fixed capital,Forecasts,Foreign\n            capital,Foreign Currency,Foreign Exchange,free\n            trade,GNP,government regulations,growth potential,growth\n            rate,imports,Income,Income\n            Statements,industrialization,interest rate,Interest\n            Rates,intermediate inputs,inventories,KDB,labor\n            productivity,Legal Framework,market\n            prices,maturities,merchant banks,Monetary Policy,net working\n            capital,oil,oil prices,payout ratio,Portfolio,price\n            controls,producers,productivity,Profitability,real GNP,Real\n            wages,savings,savings associations,Securities,Small\n            Business,technical assistance,time deposits,Transport,value\n            added,wages,wholesale prices,Working capital"}},"owner":"East Asia & Pacific Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"2381"},"facets":{}}}
