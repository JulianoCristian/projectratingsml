The ODS Projects have\n            several objectives: (a) to support the Government's\n            actions to reduce ODS consumption; (b) to establish a\n            project implementation mechanism through local institutions;\n            (c) to implement cost-effective, priority subprojects; and\n            (d) to support the adoption and commercialization of 50\n            percent reduced ODS foam applications. The objective of the\n            projects to phase out ODS consumption of the 14 subprojects\n            has been largely achieved. Compliance with project covenants\n            by the enterprises was largely achieved. The following\n            valuable lessons were drawn: (a) Policy enforcement is\n            beyond subproject implementation scope. National\n            Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) plays a very\n            important role in ensuring that complementary policy\n            enforcement is in place; (b) More accurate ODS estimates are\n            needed during project preparation and appraisal; (c) Project\n            Implementation Schedule shows that although the projects\n            were ultimately implemented correctly many inconveniences\n            and extra work could have been avoided; (d) Suppliers must\n            be carefully selected; (e) Clear and concise data at project\n            preparation will help in project implementation and supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Ozone Depleting Substance Phaseout Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Ozone Depleting Substance\n            Phaseout Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/01/727066/china-ozone-depleting-substance-phaseout-projects","projn":"CN-Ods Phase Out -- P003407,CN-Second Ods Phase Out -- P003408","subtopic":"Business Environment,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Business in Development,Global Environment Facility,Montreal Protocol","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment,Private Sector Development","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980217141358"},"subsc":"Banking,Other industry,Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment,Private Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ABC\n            powder,account,aerosols,air,butane,CFC,Chlorofluorocarbons,freeze,halon,Halon\n            1211,insulation,learning process,London\n            Amendment,managers,marketing,Montreal Protocol,Montreal\n            Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone\n            Layer,ODS,Ozone,ozone depleting substances,Ozone\n            Layer,Plastics,polyethylene,polystyrene,Private\n            Sector,procurement,reporting,safety,safety measures,sales,substitutes"},"1":{"cdata!":"ABC\n            powder,account,aerosols,air,butane,CFC,Chlorofluorocarbons,freeze,halon,Halon\n            1211,insulation,learning process,London\n            Amendment,managers,marketing,Montreal Protocol,Montreal\n            Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone\n            Layer,ODS,Ozone,ozone depleting substances,Ozone\n            Layer,Plastics,polyethylene,polystyrene,Private\n            Sector,procurement,reporting,safety,safety measures,sales,substitutes"}},"owner":"Environmt & Social Devl Sctr Dpt (EASES)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF021927-OTF - PPA CHINA ODS PROJECT I,TF021917-OTF - PPA FOR CHINA ODS II,TF021981-OTF-CHINA ODS II,TF021921-OTF - CHINA ODS I","repnb":"17299"},"facets":{}}}
