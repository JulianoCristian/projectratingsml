Bank performance on the whole was\n            satisfactory, especially during project preparation.\n            Borrower performance started well with the highly\n            satisfactory preparation of the project, and although\n            extremely weak during part of the implementation period, the\n            Borrower's overall performance during implementation\n            was judged to be satisfactory. The project outcome as a\n            whole is rated satisfactory. Project sustainability is rated\n            as likely, thanks mostly to the effective participation of\n            municipalities and the successful establishment of a State\n            Municipal Development Fund (MDF).  The main lessons for\n            future projects are that: 1) strong, well-defined\n            institutional arrangements are critical to successful\n            implementation of the project; 2) attention to the project\n            modus operandi is particularly important early on; 3)\n            municipalities should be called upon to provide counterpart\n            funding, as a means of providing incentives for increased\n            own-source revenues, and increasing project ownership; 4)\n            the Bank must become more sensitive to political cycles and\n            their effect on the project's implementation schedule\n            to improve the chances of successful completion; 5) project\n            design needs to attach specific performance targets to\n            individual project objectives; and 6) although real property\n            and betterment taxes proved to be quite small in the context\n            of total municipal revenues in the State of Santa Catarina,\n            they could play a larger role as a revenue source to municipalities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Santa Catarina Small Towns\n            Improvement
