Some lessons\n            learned included: sustained championship for reforms at the\n            secretary, undersecretary, and assistant secretary levels\n            was the key factor in the degree of progress. Given turnover\n            at the senior management level, strengthening capacity and\n            commitment by middle managers was key to success and\n            essential for sustaining reforms and system improvements.\n            Demonstrated successes were replicated across social sector\n            departments, and subsequently other government departments.\n            The involvement of World Bank (WB) and other donors in\n            reform implementation provided value added in terms of the\n            discipline and oversight involved in WB procurement and\n            financial management rules (particularly prior to passage of\n            RA 9184), and helped strengthen the position of\n            reform-oriented senior managers and line personnel,\n            particularly when they were subject to internal or external\n            pressures. Supervision missions provided important\n            opportunities for assessing progress, sharing lessons, and\n            dialogue on technical and policy issues. Reform efforts met\n            with (continuing) resistance and created considerable stress\n            for those working on changes. Reform supporters in\n            government and civil society will need to continue to work\n            together to publicize the positive contributions of reforms,\n            including in public and the media, in order to stem efforts\n            by reform opponents to reverse or weaken key legislation and\n            systems. The participation of civil society and other\n            stakeholders in procurement and monitoring of service\n            delivery is essential to ensuring efficiency in resource\n            use, enhancing impact, mobilizing resources, and increasing\n            accountability. The use of national systems was both an\n            advantage and constraint. It helped mainstream systems\n            reforms, but meant that project execution was at times\n            negatively affected by delays in the cash allotment process,\n            weaknesses in the human resource management system, etc."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Second Social Expenditure\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Second
