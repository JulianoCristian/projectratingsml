Implementing\n            units reported a lack of integration with other project\n            components, noting they often had limited contact with other\n            project components despite the significant cross-over in the\n            work being pursued. The revolution coupled with economic\n            deterioration due to the global economic recession had a\n            profound impact on this project. Consultants and independent\n            entities may be recruited by Government to help achieve\n            outcomes more efficiently, however, without building public\n            sector capacity, long term sustainability may be sacrificed\n            if Government is unable to implement activities once the\n            project is closes. At the time of writing, a third EDP\n            project is being prepared that will seek to achieve greater\n            sustainability by integrating matching grant activities\n            within

Overall disbursement is at 76 percent;\n            depending on individual components, it ranges between 57\n            percent (import technical controls) and 95 percent\n            (pre-shipment export finance guarantees facility). The\n            project is expected to create linkages between domestic and\n            offshore sectors, enhance competitiveness of private\n            enterprises, and strengthen public-private interface to\n            administer and promote internal and external trade.
