Due to a significantly lower than normal\n            rainfall coincided with the project, far less vegetation was\n            available to catalyze locust breeding. Therefore, the\n            project shifted its focus to preventative measures instead.\n            The changes deal mostly with cancellation of funds since\n            much of it was not disbursed. Key lessons learned from this\n            project are as follows: (i) In the future, with the\n            improvement of the surveillance and control system (which\n            has been strengthened by the project), such heavy treatments\n            are unlikely to be needed. Future participating\n            organizations and projects should focus more on prevention\n            and early warning than on treatment. (ii) In order to ensure\n            an improved prevention system at the international level,\n            priority should be given to the improvement, efficient use\n            and combination of recently developed complementary tools\n            such as: the permanent remote sensing and field information\n            system and the existing bio-model developed by PRIFAS on the\n            basis of the biology of locusts. (iii) The need for improved\n            international coordination in locust control programs is\n            essential. (iv) Desert locust management will also require\n            financing of multi-country program that will equitably\n            benefit all countries of the region and (v) locust control\n            activities would benefit from the use of improved and\n            alternative products that have recently been developed and\n            which promise to be less costly and less damaging to the environment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Emergency Desert Locust Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Emergency Desert Locust\n            Control

The first is to provide\n            urgent assistance in support of Algeria's national\n            locust control program.  The second is to further reinforce\n            the existing surveillance and warning systems, enabling the\n            country to better predict locust activity and movements,\n            thus facilitating planning and implementation of future\n            control programs in situations of both plague and recession.\n            The early warning activities financed under the project will\n            also benefit other countries in the region. The project will\n            essentially consist of disaster prevention rather than\n            disaster relief and the dealing with an existing emergency.\n            The project consists of the following components:  (a) three\n            locust control campaigns over the period February/March 1994\n            to January 1995; (b) further strengthening national desert\n            locust control capabilities by increasing the existing stock\n            of vehicles, spare parts for vehicles, laboratory equipment\n            for pesticide analysis, and health kits for the operators;\n            (c) for prospection purposes, provision of small\n            meteorological and mobile telecommunication equipment,\n            including air to ground receivers and 10 hand-held global\n            positioning systems; (d) provision of short-term consultancy\n            and technical documentation to strengthen the capabilities\n            of National Institute for Plant Protection in the safe\n            handling, application and storage of pesticides, and\n            disposal of pesticides and pesticide containers; and (e)\n            training in locust prospection methods, pesticide handling,\n            phytopharmacy and in pesticide-related environmental protection."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Technical annex"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Emergency Desert Locust\n            Control Project (Vol. 2) : Technical annex"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/12/735146/algeria-emergency-desert-locust-control-project-vol-2-technical-annex","projn":"DZ-Locust Control -- P034140","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Assessment,Agricultural Research,Pollution Management & Control,Pest Management,Earth Sciences & GIS","teratopic":"Environment,Science and Technology Development,Agriculture,Water Resources","count":"Algeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961005152000"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Central government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Science and Technology Development,Agriculture,Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aerial spraying,Agriculture,Atlantic\n            Ocean,audit reports,Audits,breeding,coasts,Conservation,crop\n            protection,crops,disaster,disaster\n            prevention,effluent,environmental impact,environmental\n            pollution,environmental\n            protection,export,FAO,Fenitrothion,food crops,ground\n            water,harmful substances,industrial\n            pollution,insecticides,irrigation,irrigation\n            systems,lakes,land area,Locust\n            Control,locusts,Malathion,mountains,natural\n            disasters,natural resources,North\n            Africa,orchards,pastures,pesticide,pesticide\n            poisoning,pesticide\n            use,Pesticides,plateau,plateaus,pollution,programs,pumps,Red\n            Sea,reservoirs,rivers,soils,spraying,spring,toxicologists,toxicology,water\n            resources,West,West Africa,wind"},"1":{"cdata!":"aerial spraying,Agriculture,Atlantic\n            Ocean,audit reports,Audits,breeding,coasts,Conservation,crop\n            protection,crops,disaster,disaster\n            prevention,effluent,environmental impact,environmental\n            pollution,environmental\n            protection,export,FAO,Fenitrothion,food crops,ground\n            water,harmful substances,industrial\n            pollution,insecticides,irrigation,irrigation\n            systems,lakes,land area,Locust\n            Control,locusts,Malathion,mountains,natural\n            disasters,natural resources,North\n            Africa,orchards,pastures,pesticide,pesticide\n            poisoning,pesticide\n            use,Pesticides,plateau,plateaus,pollution,programs,pumps,Red\n            Sea,reservoirs,rivers,soils,spraying,spring,toxicologists,toxicology,water\n            resources,West,West Africa,wind"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"P6189"},"facets":{}}}
