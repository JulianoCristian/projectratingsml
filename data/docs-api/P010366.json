The overall\n            lessons learned from this project include: 1) A\n            demand-driven community-based project will be slow to take\n            off, as it requires an aggressive information, education,\n            and communication campaign to spread the word about the\n            initiative, and for community mobilization. 2) Technical\n            assistance consultants to assist implementing agencies (IAs)\n            should not be permitted to mobilize specialist staff more\n            quickly than IAs can mobilize their specialist counterparts,\n            or the opportunity for technical transfer and hence\n            systems' sustainability can be lost. 3) Project rules\n            need not exclude the benefits of political involvement in\n            scheme selection, but should exclude special benefits being\n            gained by particular communities as a result, as this may\n            adversely influence the community's willingness to\n            maintain the completed works. 4) For maximum effectiveness,\n            sanitation information and training should be disseminated\n            as a package when the water supply scheme is being\n            implemented. 5) The needs of rural communities require an\n            integrated approach offering a menu of services from which\n            they can choose, based on their priorities and\n            affordability. 6) Where required, a separate Special Account\n            should be provided for each IA. 7) The use of ICB procedures\n            for community infrastructure related equipment and material\n            is not feasible, and resulted in delay of almost two years\n            at the start of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
