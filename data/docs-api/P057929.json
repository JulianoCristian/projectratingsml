Some lessons learned included: the\n            contractor in the Asmara Distribution component obtained a\n            court injunction in his home country against cashing of the\n            unconditional performance bank guarantee leaving the\n            Borrower with no immediate remedial option. A performance\n            guarantee is meant to be irrevocable and this action of the\n            contractor has very few precedents in Bank financed\n            projects. The bank should examine this case to determine if\n            there are lessons to be drawn for the terms of performance\n            guarantees in Bank financed projects. When the Bank and\n            Borrower relationship deteriorates to the point where the\n            overall dialogue is not in the least constructive, the\n            likelihood of negative spillover effects on projects should\n            not be underestimated. In such an environment, when a\n            project encounters implementation problems, there is little\n            leverage that can be exerted through the overall country\n            dialogue to
