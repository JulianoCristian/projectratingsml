Lessons learned from\n            the project: Decentralization reforms are complex\n            undertakings, requiring careful consultation, review of\n            options and development of an overarching legal framework\n            considering political, administrative and fiscal aspects in\n            tandem. Legislation will change roles, responsibilities and\n            behavior of all actors at central, deconcentrated and\n            devolved levels. The design of such projects should rest on\n            a full understanding of how deconcentrated central\n            government units interact with local governments to provide\n            services to communities. Engagement with the Borrower during\n            preparation should ensure that those involved are motivated\n            to provide the best assessment of the country's needs\n            and to empower the likely implementing agencies to take on\n            the responsibilities of executing the project. The Bank\n            should set and enforce ethical standards at the outset, and\n            be particularly careful in the selection of consultants that\n            assist in project preparation. Representation and voice of\n            prime beneficiaries: local authorities and communities\n            should play a crucial role in the design and implementation\n            of such projects and be represented in the oversight committee."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea -

There are four main components. The first\n            consolidates and deepens the budgetary reforms undertaken\n            since 1996, promoting fiscal decentralization by shifting\n            responsibilities for expenditures and revenues management to\n            local governments and communities; and assists local\n            governments in implementing a bottom-up performance\n            budgeting approach and promoting decentralized resource\n            mobilization. This component finances technical support and\n            carries out implementation studies, staff training and\n            workshops on budget and financial management, micro\n            computers and server systems, and critical operating costs.\n            The second component revises the institutional framework,\n            strengthens the ability of strategic and financial units,\n            establishes decentralized delivery and management systems;\n            and improves leadership and management capacity of elected\n            officials and administrative staff by providing training in\n            planning and budgeting, project identification and\n            preparation, and program monitoring and evaluation.
