Some of the lessons\n            learned from the project are: (a) individual projects are\n            unlikely to halt industry trends; (b) even with labor\n            productivity increases, farm size growth may be needed to\n            offset steep and secular declines in commodity prices and\n            rising opportunity cost of labor; (c) projects should not be\n            directed to one commodity only; (d) continuity in management\n            and consistency of policies are essential; and (e) formation\n            of production cooperatives (mini-estates) is unable to\n            restore comparative advantage, while formation of marketing\n            cooperatives (RSCs) does not guarantee profitability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malaysia - Second Rubber Industry\n
