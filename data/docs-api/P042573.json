Lessons learned from\n            the project were as follows: 1) Regional projects are\n            usually challenging in terms of overall management to\n            sustain ownership and commitment from the individual\n            countries. This requires more time to achieve a consensus\n            when this is essential, as in the case of the tripartite\n            agreement to establish the Transboundary Biosphere; 2) the\n            success of regional activities often depends on the adequate\n            contribution of the national structures. Frequently delay of\n            one of the sides delayed execution of all activities. To\n            avoid such problems it is necessary to strengthen the role\n            of Transboundary Steering Committee; 3) the experience\n            gained during implementation of the project demonstrated\n            that biodiversity protection presents lower risk for\n            conflicts between countries in comparison with regional\n            coordination on water resources management; 4) although\n            Protected Areas (PA) financing in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan\n            increased, weaknesses of protected areas are still evident.\n            Natural reserves need qualified specialists and a\n            possibility to find such qualified specialists is to develop\n            cooperation between PAs with scientific and educational\n            institutions, to attract students for practice in protected\n            areas and to develop voluntary activities; and 5) this\n            project proved the difficulty to contribute significant\n            counterpart funds by financially weak countries. The lesson\n            for future operations is that in such cases co-financing may\n            be from donors allocations (e.g., IDA) or though revenue\n            generation mechanisms (e.g., carbon trading)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Uzbekistan -\n            Central Asia Biodiversity GEF Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic,\n
