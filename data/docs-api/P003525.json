The primary objective of the project was to assist\n            the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments to develop\n            coastal lands for culture fisheries. Bank performance was\n            generally satisfactory. Supervision missions were undertaken\n            about once a year, alternately to each province. Borrower\n            performance was generally satisfactory, with one\n            exception-compliance with covenants in Jiangsu. The\n            project's likely outcome cannot be reliably assessed in\n            the light of the uncertainties facing the two major project\n            components, shrimp and eel production, which account for two\n            thirds of the total project cost and which are generating\n            marginal or negative financial and economic benefits at\n            present. Owing to the uncertainty of the viability of eel\n            farming in the project area, government support should be\n            directed at improving the efficiency of existing facilities\n            rather than further expansion. Other lessons in the\n            agro-processing sector emphasize the importance of greater\n            attention to commercial aspects of feasibility studies,\n            direct contact between management and markets, and\n            management responsibilities and internal organization\n            conducive to motivation of both managers and workers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

Coastal Lands Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The main objective of Coastal Lands\n            Development Project is to increase and diversify production\n            and incomes of farm families by assisting Jiangsu and\n            Zhejiang provincial governments to develop coastal lowlands,\n            mudflats and shoals for culture fisheries.  The project\n            allows coastal dwellers to switch to culture fisheries from\n            the over-exploited offshore fishing industry and to\n            supplement their earnings with livestock and horticultural\n            activities.  The project aims to (a) develop mariculture by\n            constructing or improving about 10,100 ha of ponds for\n            shrimp, eels and laver (edible seaweed); (b) support animal\n            husbandry by providing breeding stock and on-farm\n            improvements; (c) promote agriculture by establishing fruit\n            and nut production bases; and (d) further the adoption of\n            technological advances by constructing pilot plants to test\n            new approaches in various fields of production and\n            processing.  The project includes support facilities, such\n            as feed mills, cold stores, processing plants and training\n            centers and local and overseas training for technical and\n            managerial staff and farmers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Coastal Lands Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Coastal Lands Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/03/739043/china-coastal-lands-development-project","projn":"CN-Coastal Development -- P003525","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Assessment,Wetlands,Water Conservation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926121950"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accretion,agricultural\n            education,agricultural output,agricultural\n            production,Agricultural Research,agricultural\n            technology,agricultural technology\n            development,Agriculture,animal husbandry,aquaculture,arable\n            land,Audits,barley,canals,clay,Climate,coal,coastal\n            areas,coastal fishery,coastal lowlands,coastal\n            region,coastal regions,Coastal Topography,coastal\n            waters,construction,consumption\n            patterns,cropland,crops,currents,dairy\n            products,decentralization,desalination,diet,dike,dikes,Drainage,drainage\n            systems,Employment,energy\n            efficiency,equipment,erosion,evaporation,Export,Extension,farmers,Farming,farms,feed,fertilizers,Financial\n            Management,fish,fisheries,fishing,flood\n            protection,flooding,flushing,food production,Forestry,fresh\n            water,freshwater,frost,fruit,fruits,grasses,gravel,Groundwater,high\n            silt,high tide,high\n            water,ice,income,incomes,integration,Irrigation,jurisdiction,laboratory\n            equipment,land areas,Land Development,land reclamation,land\n            uses,Littoral,livestock,low\n            tide,MARKETING,marshes,mudflats,natural resources,offshore\n            fishing,oil,orchards,pond\n            water,ponds,preservation,productivity,programs,pumping,pumping\n            stations,pumps,quotas,Rainfall,refrigeration,reservoir,salinity,Sciences,sea,sea\n            water,sediment,shoals,shoreline,Silk,silt,Soils,storms,swamps,temperature,tidal\n            flats,transportation infrastructure,vegetation,water\n            content,water level,water quality,Water Resources,water\n            supply,waters,wave action,winds"},"1":{"cdata!":"accretion,agricultural\n            education,agricultural output,agricultural\n            production,Agricultural Research,agricultural\n            technology,agricultural technology\n            development,Agriculture,animal husbandry,aquaculture,arable\n            land,Audits,barley,canals,clay,Climate,coal,coastal\n            areas,coastal fishery,coastal lowlands,coastal\n            region,coastal regions,Coastal Topography,coastal\n            waters,construction,consumption\n            patterns,cropland,crops,currents,dairy\n            products,decentralization,desalination,diet,dike,dikes,Drainage,drainage\n            systems,Employment,energy\n            efficiency,equipment,erosion,evaporation,Export,Extension,farmers,Farming,farms,feed,fertilizers,Financial\n            Management,fish,fisheries,fishing,flood\n            protection,flooding,flushing,food production,Forestry,fresh\n            water,freshwater,frost,fruit,fruits,grasses,gravel,Groundwater,high\n            silt,high tide,high\n            water,ice,income,incomes,integration,Irrigation,jurisdiction,laboratory\n            equipment,land areas,Land Development,land reclamation,land\n            uses,Littoral,livestock,low\n            tide,MARKETING,marshes,mudflats,natural resources,offshore\n            fishing,oil,orchards,pond\n            water,ponds,preservation,productivity,programs,pumping,pumping\n            stations,pumps,quotas,Rainfall,refrigeration,reservoir,salinity,Sciences,sea,sea\n            water,sediment,shoals,shoreline,Silk,silt,Soils,storms,swamps,temperature,tidal\n            flats,transportation infrastructure,vegetation,water\n            content,water level,water quality,Water Resources,water\n            supply,waters,wave action,winds"}},"owner":"China & Mongolia HQ Unit (EACCQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"6986"},"facets":{}}}
