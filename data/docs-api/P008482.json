Sustainability of\n            the credit component is uncertain, but the success achieved\n            under the technical assistance component, assesses a\n            probable sustainability. The lessons indicate that,\n            particularly in transition economies, the catalytic role of\n            government in the provision of funds to private sector\n            activities, should be carefully defined during project\n            preparation, which might help in avoiding the negative\n            impact government subsidies have, on the implementation of\n            commercial credit lines. Incidentally, credit lines should\n            be designed within an overall strategy for banking sector\n            development, including capital markets, and avoid overly\n            complex eligibility criteria. Instead, emphasis should be\n            placed on the overall institutional capacity of\n            participating banks, including risk assessment, asset,\n            liability, and liquidity management, in order to enhance the\n            sustainability of a credit operation. Similarly, upon\n            lending to private investors, terms and conditions should be\n            flexible, to allow modifications when changing market\n            conditions so require. However, it should be mentioned that\n            a strong reliance on grant financing, may be conducive to\n            financial management neglect, unless a cost-recovery scheme\n            is built in early on."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary -
