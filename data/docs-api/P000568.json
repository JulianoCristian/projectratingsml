However, sustainability is likely over time,\n            due to the continuing Government's efforts to complete\n            transactions, and pursue formal, and informal international\n            assistance. The key lessons suggest that, while project\n            objectives were ambitious, given the political instability,\n            the Bank could have adopted monitoring indicators on project\n            activities to access a more explicit exit strategy, instead\n            of the implicit suspension, and cancellation threats, which\n            were in fact used. Therefore, an independent analysis of the\n            political environment, in a country where instability risks\n            the success of an operation, would be worth considering\n            prior to negotiations. The report questions the\n            implementation of significant reforms, where hostilities\n            hinder not only reform sustainability, but the process of\n            privatization itself. It also reveals the risk factor of\n            multiple project components, whose main objectives -\n            regulatory framework, privatization, and liquidation - did\n            not require financial institutions/public sector components\n            to support reform, (despite its complementing attributes to\n            a macro program); instead, the number of public enterprises\n            should have been minimal. However, the participatory process\n            demonstrated the local capacity to promote competition, and privatization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo - Privatization and Capacity Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo -

It will support\n            the divestiture of public enterprises, introduce a\n            competitive environment in the utility and petroleum sectors\n            and facilitate private sector development. More\n            specifically, the project will: help the Government prepare\n            regulatory frameworks for the five major public enterprises\n            in control of petroleum distribution, transportation,\n            telecummunications, power and water distribution and open\n            the sectors up to competition progressively; conduct the\n            privatization of these major public enterprises; liquidate\n            other non-viable public enterprises; and support regulation\n            and competition in the financial sector and reforms in\n            banking institutions. To achieve this objective the project\n            comprises the following four components: 1) a regulation and\n            privatization component whereby consulting services will be\n            provided to prepare pro-competition regulatory frameworks\n            and build a minimal level of public sector capacity to\n            regulate the major utilities, as well as to advise the\n            Government on privatization of the five concerned public\n            enterprises; 2) a public enterprise sector liquidation in\n            which assistance will be provided to liquidate all\n            non-viable enterprises; 3) reform of financial institutions\n            and the public sector which will finance the development of\n            proposals for restructuring the financial sector; and 4) a\n            communications campaign which will finance a public\n            information campaign to inform stakeholders and the public\n            of the benefits and implications of the reform program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo - Projet de Privatisation et de\n            R\u00e9forme du Service Public"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo - Privatization and\n            Capacity Building Project : Congo - Projet de Privatisation\n            et de R\u00e9forme du Service Public"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/07/15599111/congo-privatization-capacity-building-project-congo-projet-de-privatisation-de-r\u00e9forme-du-service-public","count":"Congo, Republic of","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Information and communications,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Banking;
