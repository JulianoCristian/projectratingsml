rainfed areas by expanding rubber\n            production; (b) to help improve the country's balance\n            of payments by increasing rubber exports; and (c) to lay the\n            foundation for further development of the tree crop\n            subsector nationwide. The project includes: (a) a four-year\n            time slice of the Office of the Rubber Replanting Aid Fund\n            Board's program, including (i) replanting of rubber\n            trees at a rate of about 50,000 ha p.a.; (ii) continuation\n            and completion of replantings already started; (iii)\n            training of staff in the cultivation of coconut and its\n            intercrops; and (iv) provision of technical support to a\n            pilot scheme for new rubber planting; and (b) strengthening\n            the capabilities of the Department of Agriculture, the Land\n            Development Department and the Office of Agricultural\n            Economics to plan and carry out programs for rubber and\n            coconut development, including the preparation of a tree\n            crop subsector study."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Second Tree Crops Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Second Tree Crops Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/11/726024/thailand-second-tree-crops-project","projn":"TH-Tree Crops II -- P004722","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Research,Food & Beverage Industry,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912540340"},"subsc":"(Historic)Perennial crops","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Cooperatives,agricultural\n            development,Agricultural Economics,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural growth,agricultural\n            inputs,agricultural land,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,Audits,balance of payments,capita\n            incomes,cassava,cocoa,coconut,Coconuts,coffee,commodity,Cooperatives,copra,CROP,crop\n            development,crop diversification,crop\n            yields,Cultivation,Dam,degradation,dry season,ecological\n            conditions,edible oils,Environmental\n            Impact,equipment,extension services,Farm,farm\n            incomes,farmer,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,fertilizer,fertilizers,fisheries,forestry,fruit,fruit\n            crops,fruit\n            trees,gardens,harvesting,Horticulture,husbandry,Hybrid\n            seed,incidence of\n            poverty,Income,intercropping,Irrigation,kenaf,labor\n            costs,labor force,Land Development,land use,maize,marginal\n            lands,market prices,Marketing,National Agricultural\n            Research,natural resource base,natural\n            resources,Nurseries,oil palm,orchards,palm\n            oil,pesticides,planting materials,Present Value,private\n            sector,processing,productivity,rainfed\n            areas,Replanting,rice,rice fields,Rubber,rubber,rubber\n            industry,rubber prices,rural communities,Rural\n            Infrastructure,rural poverty,seed,shifting cultivation,small\n            farmers,small-scale producers,soils,sugar,sugarcane,Tree\n            Crops,tropical fruits,UNDP,United Nations,United Nations\n            Development Programme,wages,yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Cooperatives,agricultural\n            development,Agricultural Economics,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural growth,agricultural\n            inputs,agricultural land,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,Audits,balance of payments,capita\n            incomes,cassava,cocoa,coconut,Coconuts,coffee,commodity,Cooperatives,copra,CROP,crop\n            development,crop diversification,crop\n            yields,Cultivation,Dam,degradation,dry season,ecological\n            conditions,edible oils,Environmental\n            Impact,equipment,extension services,Farm,farm\n            incomes,farmer,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,fertilizer,fertilizers,fisheries,forestry,fruit,fruit\n            crops,fruit\n            trees,gardens,harvesting,Horticulture,husbandry,Hybrid\n            seed,incidence of\n            poverty,Income,intercropping,Irrigation,kenaf,labor\n            costs,labor force,Land Development,land use,maize,marginal\n            lands,market prices,Marketing,National Agricultural\n            Research,natural resource base,natural\n            resources,Nurseries,oil palm,orchards,palm\n            oil,pesticides,planting materials,Present Value,private\n            sector,processing,productivity,rainfed\n            areas,Replanting,rice,rice fields,Rubber,rubber,rubber\n            industry,rubber prices,rural communities,Rural\n            Infrastructure,rural poverty,seed,shifting cultivation,small\n            farmers,small-scale producers,soils,sugar,sugarcane,Tree\n            Crops,tropical fruits,UNDP,United Nations,United Nations\n            Development Programme,wages,yields"}},"owner":"Southeast Asia Headquarters Unit (EACSQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"3404"},"facets":{}}}
