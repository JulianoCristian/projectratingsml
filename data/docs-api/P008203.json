efficiency and international\n            competitiveness. It has a policy reform component and a\n            technical assistance component. The policy reform component\n            will be quick disbursing in two tranches. The technical\n            assistance component will finance consultants services,\n            computer software, and limited computer hardware to support\n            key studies and institutional reforms. Trade policy reform\n            seeks to encourage production of tradable goods through\n            neutralizing productive incentives. The first phase of the\n            program will concentrate on the manufacturing sector,\n            eliminating quantitative import restrictions, reforming the\n            tariff structure, and rationalizing export incentives. In\n            the second phase, agricultural import restrictions will be\n            eliminated and tariffs further reduced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Venezuela - Trade Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Venezuela - Trade Policy Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1989/05/739281/venezuela-trade-policy-loan-project","projn":"VE-Trade Policy Ln -- P008203","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Economic Stabilization,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Trade Policy,Free Trade","teratopic":"International Economics and Trade","count":"Venezuela, Republica Bolivariana de","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960927202219"},"subsc":"(Historic)Industrial adjustment","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"International Economics and Trade","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adjustment Program,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,Average Tariff,Average\n            Tariffs,balance of payments,basic metals,bonds,capital\n            flight,Capital goods,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,comparative advantage,competitiveness,consumer\n            prices,consumers,country of origin,CURRENCY,current\n            account,current account\n            deficit,customs,Debt,deregulation,devaluation,development\n            strategy,domestic market,domestic prices,domestic\n            production,economic crisis,Economic Growth,economic\n            incentives,economic policies,economic problems,economic\n            situation,Economic\n            Statistics,employment,equilibrium,exchange rate,Exchange\n            Rate Regime,exchange rates,export bias,export\n            earnings,Export Financing,export incentives,export\n            ratio,Export Restrictions,export\n            supply,exporters,Exports,external financing,external\n            tariffs,external trade,final goods,financial\n            subsidies,fiscal deficit,fixed investment,foreign\n            borrowing,foreign currency,foreign exchange,Foreign\n            Trade,GDP,government budget,Gross Domestic Product,import\n            competition,Import Controls,import duties,Import\n            Licensing,import restrictions,import\n            substitution,Imports,Income,industrial\n            sector,inflation,interest rate,Interest rates,intermediate\n            goods,international competitiveness,International Monetary\n            Fund,INTERNATIONAL TRADE,international transactions,labor force,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Adjustment Program,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,Average Tariff,Average\n            Tariffs,balance of payments,basic metals,bonds,capital\n            flight,Capital goods,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,comparative advantage,competitiveness,consumer\n            prices,consumers,country of origin,CURRENCY,current\n            account,current account\n            deficit,customs,Debt,deregulation,devaluation,development\n            strategy,domestic market,domestic prices,domestic\n            production,economic crisis,Economic Growth,economic\n            incentives,economic policies,economic problems,economic\n            situation,Economic\n            Statistics,employment,equilibrium,exchange rate,Exchange\n            Rate Regime,exchange rates,export bias,export\n            earnings,Export Financing,export incentives,export\n            ratio,Export Restrictions,export\n            supply,exporters,Exports,external financing,external\n            tariffs,external trade,final goods,financial\n            subsidies,fiscal deficit,fixed investment,foreign\n            borrowing,foreign currency,foreign exchange,Foreign\n            Trade,GDP,government budget,Gross Domestic Product,import\n            competition,Import Controls,import duties,Import\n            Licensing,import restrictions,import\n            substitution,Imports,Income,industrial\n            sector,inflation,interest rate,Interest rates,intermediate\n            goods,international competitiveness,International Monetary\n            Fund,INTERNATIONAL TRADE,international transactions,labor force,"}},"owner":"LCR Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"P5066"},"facets":{}}}
