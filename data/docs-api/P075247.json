The approach to land reform piloted under the\n            project includes (i) voluntary acquisition by communities of\n            land sold by willing estate owners, transferred to\n            communities by government, or donated by private\n            individuals); (ii) on-farm development, including the\n            establishment of shelter, and the purchase of basic inputs\n            and necessary advisory services; and (iii) land\n            administration, viz. the regularization, titling, and\n            registration of beneficiaries' property rights in land.\n            The project has the following four components: Component 1)\n            will be implemented with direct community involvement in\n            identification and negotiation of land acquisition and the\n            preparation of farm development proposals. Community\n            proposals for acquiring land and farm development would be\n            reviewed and approved - taking into account legal,\n            technical, environmental, and poverty reduction criteria-by\n            a district-level multi-stakeholder entity. Component 2)\n            secure title will be provided to the beneficiaries. The\n            communities will decide under what property rights regime\n            they wish to register their land and how to distribute land\n            among participating households, which could include the\n            registration of individual plots, if requested by the\n            community. Component 3) will finance public information\n            campaigns, community mobilization, participatory rural\n            appraisal, training and technical support to communities,\n            district and national participating institutions and\n            stakeholders.
