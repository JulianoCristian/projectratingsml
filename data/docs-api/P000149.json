Bank staff and officials of the Borrower\n            involved in project implementation enjoyed a sound\n            professional and working relationship. This contributed to\n            the successful completion of the project, without any major\n            issue or delays. On the whole, all project components were\n            fully implemented, with no major difficulties. All project\n            Instructions were likewise fully operational. The main\n            deficiency of the project is that it did not address\n            adequately qualitative and institutional Issues. The lessons\n            derived from implementation of the project include the\n            following: there should be an appropriate balance between\n            support for expansion of physical facilities and qualitative\n            improvement of the system. The project confirms the need for\n            a careful and systematic consideration during project\n            generation of the location of project institutions,\n            especially technical and vocational institutions. It\n            underscores the need for a holistic approach to project\n            design, where needs for physical expansion, quality\n            improvement and strengthening strategic institutions in the\n            sector are properly balanced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Botswana - Fourth Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Botswana - Fourth Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/09/736396/botswana-fourth-education-project","projn":"BW-Educ.Iv-115975 -- P000149","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Curriculum & Instruction,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Botswana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925232553"},"subsc":"Secondary education","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"apprenticeship training,basic\n            education,budgetary\n            provision,classrooms,composition,curriculum,drawing,economic\n            development,education projects,education system,educational\n            institutions,educational objectives,educational\n            quality,educational structure,employment,employment\n            opportunities,engineering,enrollment,equitable access,formal\n            education,head teachers,holistic approach,Housing,improving\n            access,Industrial Training,instructional\n            materials,leadership,library books,Local\n            Authorities,National Education,non-formal\n            education,population growth,primary education,primary\n            school,primary school enrollment,primary school\n            leavers,primary schools,pupils,reference books,rural\n            education,school construction,school leavers,secondary\n            education,Secondary Schools,social development,staff\n            development,student\n            places,teacher,teachers,teaching,textbooks,trainees,Training\n            Centers,training programs,vocational education,Vocational Training,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"apprenticeship training,basic\n            education,budgetary\n            provision,classrooms,composition,curriculum,drawing,economic\n            development,education projects,education system,educational\n            institutions,educational objectives,educational\n            quality,educational structure,employment,employment\n            opportunities,engineering,enrollment,equitable access,formal\n            education,head teachers,holistic approach,Housing,improving\n            access,Industrial Training,instructional\n            materials,leadership,library books,Local\n            Authorities,National Education,non-formal\n            education,population growth,primary education,primary\n            school,primary school enrollment,primary school\n            leavers,primary schools,pupils,reference books,rural\n            education,school construction,school leavers,secondary\n            education,Secondary Schools,social development,staff\n            development,student\n            places,teacher,teachers,teaching,textbooks,trainees,Training\n            Centers,training programs,vocational education,Vocational Training,workers"}},"owner":"WB Off:Pretoria - Southern AFR 1 (AFCS1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"11164"},"739951":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/11/739951/botswana-fourth-education-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/11/739951/botswana-fourth-education-project","new_url":"1985/11/739951/botswana-fourth-education-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/11/01/000009265_3970625094042/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/11/01/000009265_3970625094042/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2644","docdt":"1985-11-30T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1985-11-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Botswana - Fourth Education Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project would support the\n            Government's educational reform program and its primary\n            goals of improving access to primary and secondary education\n            and making the system more responsive to the needs of\n            Botswana's economy.
