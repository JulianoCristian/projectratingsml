The\n            project achieved its main objective, institutional\n            development has been partially achieved, sustainability is\n            likely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, flexible and demand-driven design,\n            appropriate \"macro\" indicators for monitoring\n            implementation performance, and performance-based\n            eligibility criteria are appropriate for\n            emergency/restoration type projects involving multiple\n            implementing agencies. Second, proactive supervision and\n            stringent application of efficiency criteria in procurement\n            and contract administration helps improve borrower/agency\n            implementation performance. Third, regular high level\n            oversight of project implementation by provincial and\n            federal authorities, coupled with good coordination and\n            implementation support by the supervisory consultants, is\n            important for successful project implementation. Fourth,\n            financing and disbursement arrangements require careful\n            design. Fifth, full-time project coordinators at the\n            provincial and agency levels, with appropriate powers to\n            address and resolve implementation bottlenecks, would\n            improve borrower performance. Finally, projects involving\n            extensive contract administration should provide for the\n            training of implementing agency staff in modern contract\n            management techniques."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
