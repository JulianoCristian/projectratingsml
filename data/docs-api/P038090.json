Some lessons learned included: a long period\n            of preparation involving disagreements between the\n            implementing agencies is an indication of potential problems\n            that may arise during project implementation. It is\n            important to assess government and cross-party commitment\n            before designing a complex reform project, as a project\n            without sufficient broad buy-in may not be sustainable.\n            Technical assistance provided by the Bank is still relevant\n            and highly valued in the new European Union (EU) countries\n            provided it is aligned with the country's needs and\n            delivered in a timely and appropriate manner. Pooling of\n            World Bank and EU funds and thereby leveraging EU funds to\n            support social sector reforms could be a useful tool. The\n            probability of success in any reform, including in social\n            sectors, is higher where there is a reform champion, but\n            broader support is needed for sustainability. To\n            institutionalize new systems, processes and practices and\n            ensuring the sustainability of ownership by the implementing\n            agencies is also essential."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Slovak Republic - Social Benefits Reform\n            Administration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Slovak Republic - Social Benefits\n            Reform

support the Government's plans for pension reform by\n            improving the policy framework and management of its social\n            protection system. There are three project components. The\n            first finances technical assistance, training, office\n            equipment, hardware, and software to improve the\n            institutional capacity of the Ministry of Labor, Social\n            Affairs, and Family (MOLSAF), the Social Insurance Agency\n            (SIA), and the National Labor Office (NLO). In particular,\n            it assists the MOLSAF in developing a multi-pillar pension\n            reform. The component also targets training on actuarial\n            projections, public information campaigns, policy analysis\n            for other social programs, and human resource training. The\n            second component finances technical assistance, hardware,\n            software, and services to put in place and manage an\n            efficient infrastructure to process the financial flow to\n            and from the social sector agencies, initially, to collect\n            social insurance contributions and employment program\n            contributions. Activities under this component include\n            technical assistance for joint collection system and client\n            services, and for audit and enforcement. The third component\n            develops a client database and information systems to\n            support social sector programs. Activities included under\n            this component include an application environment to support\n            individual client accounting for pensions and sickness\n            insurance; and
