Some lessons learned\n            included: unless the source and amounts of financing of the\n            project are clearly defined from the outset, any delays in\n            securing the additional financing can jeopardize the\n            successful completion of the project. In the case of the\n            Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) parallel\n            financing, the delays caused by the recruitment of the\n            management consultant and the lack of detailed designs for a\n            number of sub-components led to significant delays in\n            operational zing the loan before the new management decided\n            to suspend the loan in late 1995. It is as important to\n            supervise contract implementation as the procurement\n            process; the executing agency as well as the Bank should\n            engage specialists for highly specialized technical work\n            involved in project supervision. It was clear that Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Company of Valparaiso (ESVAL) did not\n            get the needed advice (from the supervision consultant nor\n            the Bank) when the contractor proposed the change of\n            construction technology (open trench to pipe jacking) for\n            less than 10 percent additional cost and no time extension.\n            Municipalities should be consulted before contracts are\n            tendered to deal with their concerns and remove any\n            objections to the implementation plans; permits should also\n            be secured in these negotiations and not be left to\n            contractors to obtain. Legally binding agreements should be\n            signed in order to avoid future political interference.\n            Moreover, many of the complaints by the Municipality of\n            Valparaiso and some local groups would have been best\n            addressed within public hearings prior to project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Second Valparaiso Water Supply and\n
