Some lessons learned included: in\n            order to reach sustainable utilization of natural resources,\n            a longer time frame is needed. The impact of the pilot on\n            improvement and restoration of the natural resources\n            (ecosystem) can be evaluated after a certain period of time.\n            There should be a window of time to conduct a proper\n            evaluation, since environmental projects have long term\n            impact. In most project locations, tree planting on private\n            land and small business development were highly profitable.\n            This was not the case for sub-projects involving ecosystem\n            protection or rehabilitation, which were often seen as cash\n            for work programs, and whose long-term sustainability\n            remains unclear. Although profit-sharing arrangements were\n            usually put in place to distribute the benefits of income\n            generating sub-projects equitably, the recording of revenues\n            and expenditures was inadequate. Timely disbursements of\n            block grants are essential for success, as late\n            disbursements often forced communities to undertake\n            sub-projects in very short timeframes, or during a season\n            not suited for planting. The quality of facilitators is the\n            main driver of community-based project implementation\n            quality. For this reason, it is essential that the\n            government: (i) offer competitive salaries and adequate\n            allowances to facilitators; (ii) ensure that vacant\n            facilitator positions are promptly filled; and (iii) provide\n            good quality training to facilitators. PNPM green mobilized\n            several trust funds, all of which contributed to the overall\n            objective of the program and enabled Civil Society\n            Organizations (CSOs) to contribute to effective\n            implementation. Steps have been taken in PNPM rural to\n            substantially strengthen the procedures for community-level\n            procurement to focus on achieving value for money while\n            ensuring transparency and accountability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
