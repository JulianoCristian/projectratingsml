The relevance of the project's policy\n            measures are reflected by subsequent structural adjustments\n            loans (SAL), which further strengthen the reform program.\n            Both performances, the Bank and Borrower's, are\n            reviewed in terms of what reasonably transpired as a result\n            of the financial crisis, and what would have been a better\n            course in retrospect. Similarly, the lessons learned are\n            reviewed within that context, suggesting that both the Bank,\n            and Korean authorities should have maintained closer ties,\n            to better anticipate the events leading to the crisis.\n            Although the Bank customized the operation to meet the\n            urgency of the situation, earlier involvement in discussions\n            with the Government, and the International Monetary Fund\n            (IMF), should have taken place. The potential to maximize\n            negotiation results, once stabilization measures are\n            established, could be emphasized to achieve reforms;\n            however, any additional conditionality should be taken into\n            consideration, for the program's effectiveness could be\n            well in danger. The Bank should have the capacity for\n            management portfolio risk, to assess risk adjustment capital\n            allocation. However, careful consistency with the\n            Bank's business, i.e., development institution, should\n            be maintained; hence, a subsequent policy specifies this\n            concern, in the form of special SALs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Economic Reconstruction Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Korea - Economic Reconstruction\n            Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/05/728321/korea-economic-reconstruction-loan-project","projn":"KR-Emergency Asst.
