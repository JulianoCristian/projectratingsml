The objectives of the project were to\n            expand the water supply and sewerage facilities for the city\n            of Bombay and further strengthen the Water Supply and\n            Sewerage Department's (WSSD) implementation capacity\n            and its financial and operational performance. These\n            objectives were to be achieved by: (a) continuing and\n            expanding on the efforts of previous projects in improving\n            sector efficiency through improvements in project\n            management, procurement, billing and collections, and leak\n            detection and repair in the WSSD; (b) expanding water supply\n            and sanitation facilities for the urban poor; (c) increasing\n            the supply of water to the Municipal Corporation of Greater\n            Bombay (MCGB) area by 455 million liters per day (Mld) to\n            help reduce Bombay's deficit; (d) expanding\n            Bombay's sewerage system in the isolated developed\n            areas; and (e) evaluating operational experience and\n            developing appropriate design criteria and technical options\n            for future investments in sewage treatment. The Bank\n            performance was deficient during preparation and\n            supervision. The Bank performance was deficient during\n            preparation and supervision. The poor overall result\n            indicates that there were important deficiencies in Borrower\n            performance. The key lessons learned are as follows:  Many\n            of the lessons from this project have already been accepted\n            and incorporated into current Bank practices. The board\n            lessons include the need to prepare plans ahead of\n            implementation for involuntary resettlement and procurement;\n            obtain convincing evidence of the existence of Borrower\n            ownership; use standard bidding documents; and, have agreed\n            monitoring reports submitted to the Bank quarterly.Long\n            delays may occur if adequate attention is not given during\n            preparation to the coordination of works and other tasks\n            with other public sector agencies. In order to allow\n            sufficient time to enable the signing of contracts to occur,\n            the evaluation of bids should be completed within the first\n            half of the prescribed bid validity period. Identification\n            of all important studies and preparation of consultant\n            recruitment documents should be completed by appraisal and\n            the recruitment of consultants should be completed as per\n            the procurement schedule agreed at negotiations. Consultant\n            recruitment for key studies should be completed before loan effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Third Bombay Water Supply and\n            Sewerage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India -
