To that end, the project consists of (a) special\n            Maintenance works on about 400,000 ha of irrigated land,\n            about 106,000 ha of reclaimed swamp land, and five river\n            mouths, so that these can sustain efficient O&M in\n            future.  In addition, the project entails (b) systematic\n            introduction of efficient O&M on about 700,000 ha of\n            irrigated land and 87,000 ha of swamp land; (c) completion\n            of about 40 priority, GOI-funded on-going projects, selected\n            on the basis of agreed technical and economic criteria; (d)\n            pilot groundwater development through construction of some\n            900 tubewells for small farmers in primarily rainfed areas;\n            and (e) support for policy reforms and institutional\n            strengthening and training.
