Some lessons learned included: the\n            PRDP was based on optimistic assumptions with respect to the\n            easing of movement and access and other economic\n            restrictions imposed by Government of Israel (GoI). Making\n            substantial progress towards fiscal sustainability will not\n            have been possible, were it not for the shift in the\n            development strategy by the Palestinian National Authority\n            (PNA) towards community development projects which are not\n            as vulnerable to these restrictions. This shift triggered\n            some economic growth in the West Bank in 2008 and a 13\n            percent increase in gross PNA revenues in New Israeli Shekel\n            (NIS) terms. The gross revenues increased by 10.4 percent in\n            NIS terms over 2008, despite the weakness of clearance\n            revenues during first half of the year. Domestic tax\n            revenues increased by 10.3 percent, as a result of strong\n            collection efforts put in place by the ministry of finance,\n            particularly during the second half of the year, for the\n            income and property taxes and due to reforms in domestic tax\n            administration and robust economic growth. The economic\n            growth momentum achieved in 2009 appears to be continuing in\n            2010 and, if sustained, PNA gross revenues are expected to\n            exceed US$2 billion for the first time. The PNA does not\n            control its political and economic environment due to daily\n            Israeli Defence Forces incursions into Palestinian areas and\n            the erosion of Palestinian economic space through the\n            expansion of settlements. Consequently, the implementation\n            of reforms, including prior actions, may be thrown off track\n            due to these actions. Therefore, the reform process and\n            implementation calendar must demonstrate a substantial\n            degree of flexibility. Despite the challenges faced by the\n            PNA in 2009, and the continued pressures imposed by the\n            occupation, especially the emergency spending in Gaza in the\n            aftermath of Israel's military operation which raised\n            the deficit from roughly US$1.3 billion in 2008 to US$1.6\n            billion on a commitment basis in 2009, the budget execution\n            in 2009 has been very strong, partly due to the robust\n            economic growth in 2009, which is estimated at about 7\n            percent in real terms, and partly due to the number of\n            institutional and administrative reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Palestinian Reform and\n            Development Plan and Second Development Policy Grant

Despite enormous\n            challenges, the Palestinian Authority (PA) continues to make\n            strides towards creating the structure of a future\n            Palestinian State. However, during the past several years\n            the political process has stagnated and there has been\n            little visible progress towards a long term peace\n            settlement. As a consequence, the economy has continued to\n            deteriorate with low investment, the productive base\n            hollowing out and per capita Gross Domestic product (GDP)\n            declining. GDP levels are only maintained through massive\n            inflows of foreign aid that has propped up consumption and\n            government spending. Despite this, the PA, with generous\n            support from the international community, has moved ahead\n            with creating the institutional structures required to\n            provide needed services to the Palestinian people. The World\n            Bank's ongoing technical assistance and budget support\n            has been instrumental to these efforts, especially in\n            helping the PA mobilize the international assistance needed\n            to fund their operations. Regular and consistent external\n            support is required to maintain momentum and World Bank\n            assistance is viewed by all donors as a strong indication\n            that the PA is
