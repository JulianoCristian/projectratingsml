Lessons learned included: 1) In instances\n            where projects are managed by line managers, as was the case\n            in this project where the Director, Petroleum Division was\n            designated as the Project Manger, provision needs to be made\n            for support throughout the project implementation period as\n            there may not be constancy of appointment; 2) The use of PTF\n            ensured that each implementation activity is properly\n            conceived, pursues the hierarchy of project objectives and\n            is amenable to accounting; 3) The project management\n            reporting (PMR) as required by the Bank's Project\n            Financial Management Manual dated February 1999 was more\n            exhaustive than was suitable to a technical assistance (TA)\n            project such as this with no major goods and works\n            procurement and relatively few transactions per year; 4) In\n            the implementation of TA projects that are seeking to\n            enhance staff capacity in the context of uncertain and\n            changing sector development, rigidity of project design\n            should be avoided; 5) The uncertainty of petroleum sector\n            developments arises from price, politics and markets all of\n            which are intrinsically uncertain in themselves; 6) In TA\n            projects such as this where the enhancement of staff skills\n            is sought, it is difficult to reconcile and measure the\n            advancement of skills during the implementation period and\n            the consequent improvement in performance; and 7) In the\n            conduct of the Institutional Studies and the subsequent\n            follow up study great emphasis was placed on consultation\n            with the staff. This provided valuable input and heightened\n            the sense of ownership of the strategy developed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea - Gas Development and\n            Utilization Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Papua New Guinea - Gas\n            Development and Utilization Technical Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/03/7582813/papua-new-guinea-gas-development-utilization-technical-assistance-project","projn":"PG-Gas Dev Ta -- P066954","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Oil Refining & Gas Industry,Environment and Energy Efficiency,Water and Industry,Energy Production and Transportation,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Environment,Energy,Industry,Water Resources","count":"Papua New Guinea","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070503151737"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Oil and gas","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Energy,Industry,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ammonia, and gas, and gas sector, approach,\n            associated gas, barrel, Barrels of Oil, coal, Conservation,\n            construction, crude prices, employment, Energy prices,\n            environmental impact, environmental protection, Fiscal\n            Stability, fiscal terms, GAS, Gas Agreement, gas delivery,\n            GAS DEVELOPMENT, gas development project, gas discoveries,\n            gas exploration, gas field, gas field development, gas\n            fields, gas infrastructure, gas pipeline, gas production,\n            gas projects, gas quality, gas resource, gas resource\n            development, gas resources, gas sales, gas sector, gas\n            sector development, gas transmission, gas transmission and\n            distribution system, gas transmission system, gas\n            utilization, high levels, higher oil prices, industrial use,\n            investment in gas exploration, investment opportunities,\n            large-scale gas, LNG, methane, million barrels, Mineral,\n            Mineral Resources, national oil, natural gas, natural gas\n            reserves, natural gas resources, oil, oil and gas, oil and\n            gas sector, oil companies, Oil Equivalent, oil fields, oil\n            price, oil prices, oil production, oil revenues, Petroleum,\n            petroleum development, Petroleum Exploration, petroleum\n            industry, petroleum sector, pipeline, pipelines, power,\n            power generation, price of oil, private sector, Project\n            Management, recoverable gas, recoverable gas reserves,\n            recoverable reserves, transmission system"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Oceania"},"1":{"geo_region":"Oceania"}},"repnb":"ICR304"},"437683":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/05/437683/papua-new-guinea-gas-development-utilization-technical-assistance-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/05/437683/papua-new-guinea-gas-development-utilization-technical-assistance-project","new_url":"2000/05/437683/papua-new-guinea-gas-development-utilization-technical-assistance-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/06/08/000094946_00051605321684/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/06/08/000094946_00051605321684/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"7019","datestored":"2000-06-08T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2000-05-02T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea - Gas Development and\n            Utilization Technical Assistance Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Gas Development and Utilization\n            Technical Assistance Project, will strengthen the\n            Government's capacity, to efficiently manage the gas\n            sector development in Papua New Guinea. The components call\n            for: 1) enhanced skills within the Petroleum Division's\n            expertise in gas resource evaluation, market assessment,\n            processing, and distribution.
