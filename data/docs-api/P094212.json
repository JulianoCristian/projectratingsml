Life is coming back\n            to Gostusha, a village on Serbia\u2019s famous Old Mountain.\n            Until recently, Gostusha was fading away, the village\u2019s\n            traditional architecture and way of life vanishing, taking a\n            piece of Serbia\u2019s heritage with them. With support from the\n            World Bank, the Serbian Government is offering small grants,\n            tempting people back to deserted villages. Tourism in\n            Gostusha, Senokos, and Dojkinci are helping do that. Through\n            farming and tourism, the grants aim to bring life back to\n            these lovely hills and pastures. The project also finances\n            small repairs to roads and other infrastructure, as well as\n            trails for hiking and biking. Up on Old Mountain\u2019s pastures,\n            the animals are coming back, too. The land here was once\n            famous for its cattle. Now farmers are investing in rare\n            breeds, and once-neglected pastures are being used once\n            again. Water buffalo, mountain ponies, Busha cattle, and\n            donkeys are once more grazing this land. Serbian officials\n            want the region to catch up with European agricultural\n            standards. Grant money is used for the production of\n            renowned local cheeses, for wool manufacturing, and for the\n            sustainable management of Old Mountain\u2019s abundant natural resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"In Serbia - Old mountain renewed"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"In Serbia - Old mountain renewed"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/10/25053568/serbia-old-mountain-renewed","topic":"Environment and Natural Resources m1327391 566,Agribusiness m1326896 2179,Environmental Sustainability m1325984 1786,Linking Farmers with Markets m1325991 1959,Natural Resources Management m1326215 600","projn":"YF-Transitional Agriculture Reform Project\n            -- P094212","subtopic":"Rural Urban Linkages,Biodiversity,Wildlife Resources,Peri-Urban Communities,Livestock and Animal Husbandry","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Environment,Agriculture,Urban Development","count":"Serbia","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0830e2636_1_0"},"theme":"Rural policies and institutions,Rural markets,Regional integration,Rural services and infrastructure","subsc":"Central government administration,Agricultural extension and research","colti":"Results Profile","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Environment,Agriculture,Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Environment and Natural Resources m1327391 566,Agribusiness m1326896 2179,Environmental Sustainability m1325984 1786,Linking Farmers with Markets m1325991 1959,Natural Resources Management m1326215 600","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"breed, grazing, villages, flock, pasture,\n            nature, village, animal welfare, donkeys, sheep, wool,\n            animal, buffalo, animals, welfare, pastures, breeds,\n            sustainable management, tourism, cattle, farming, cows,\n            farmers, natural resources, food, genetic, water buffalo, roads"}},"owner":"Urban, Rural & Soc Dev - GP (GSURR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF055134-PHRD-SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO:\n            RURAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT","majtheme":"Trade and integration,Rural development","repnb":"93640"},"16773030":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/09/16773030/serbia-transitional-agriculture-reform-global-environment-facility-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/09/16773030/serbia-transitional-agriculture-reform-global-environment-facility-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","new_url":"2012/09/16773030/serbia-transitional-agriculture-reform-global-environment-facility-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","disclosure_date":"2012-09-26T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-09-26T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-09-26T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/09/27/000356161_20120927012725/Rendered/INDEX/724210v10PJPR0032B0Project0Paper05.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/09/27/000356161_20120927012725/Rendered/PDF/724210v10PJPR0032B0Project0Paper05.pdf","loan_no":"7465","datestored":"2012-09-27T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2012-09-25T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Serbia - Transitional Agriculture Reform\n            Global Environment Facility Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the\n            Transitional Agriculture Reform Global Environment Facility\n            Project for Serbia is to enhance the competitiveness of\n            Serbian agriculture.

However,\n            in view of recent demonstrated implementation progress, an\n            upgrade of these indicators is expected to be conducted\n            following the next implementation support mission\n            (tentatively April 2012).  This is a noteworthy development\n            since, in the first three years following approval, the\n            project had suffered severe delays, including a 16-month\n            effectiveness delay, and disbursed only 6 percent of the\n            loan.  Following a mixed implementation history between\n            mid-2010 and mid-2011, project performance has meanwhile\n            vastly improved, with all actions met in an action plan\n            agreed with the Bank, and having laid the foundation for the\n            December 2011 extension of the project closing date to June\n            15, 2012."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Serbia - Transitional Agriculture\n            Reform Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/02/15822271/serbia-transitional-agriculture-reform-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"YF-Transitional Agriculture Reform Project\n            -- P094212","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Debt Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Housing & Human Habitats,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Rural Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Serbia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20120221222335"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Rural Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"action plan, Agriculture, Competitive\n            Grants, Expenditures, extension, Financial Management,\n            Front-end, Interest Rate, Interest Rate Caps, LOAN, Loan\n            amount, results"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Development (ECSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF055134-PHRD-SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO:\n            RURAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT","repnb":"66942"},"facets":{}}}
