Lessons learned from the\n            projects included: in Vietnam it is increasingly likely that\n            projects that build water infrastructure will be called on\n            to perform environmental restoration as well as their core\n            activities, if they are to have sustainable outcomes. The\n            four projects studied share certain characteristics. First\n            and foremost is the nature of their relationship to the\n            environment. Whereas traditionally Bank water sector\n            projects had either an institutional or infrastructure focus\n            or both, it is becoming nearly impossible to avoid\n            addressing environmental restoration and environmentally\n            related land use questions in many areas of the country. In\n            the four evaluated projects it was assumed that investments\n            in infrastructure will overcome what were in essence\n            environmental problems. If all the mangroves have been\n            destroyed it is never enough just to plant new ones:\n            reforestation and forest protection have to address the\n            underlying social causes of encroachment and provide\n            alternative sources of income if they hope to stop\n            environmentally negative actions that produce income for the\n            malefactors. Conversely, addressing livelihood problems can\n            have positive environmental impacts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Irrigation Rehabilitation Project;\n            Water Supply Project;

     follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            decentralization in management decision-making to the\n            provincial level and below is the key to the success of\n            integrated conservation and development projects because\n            coordination and communication among different sector\n            agencies are more effective at local levels. Linked to\n            decentralization are the accountability and the ability to\n            shift resources from the center to the provinces and between\n            provinces based on performance. Simplicity in project design\n            is critical to avoid a heavy dependency of implementation on\n            external technical assistance. Local absorptive capacity\n            should be carefully considered to match with the complexity\n            of the design. An early mid-term review (MTR) is important\n            to assess and make necessary changes to cope with new\n            developments. Restructuring should not be seen as failure\n            but a means to up-date a project design and to improve the\n            quality of design and implementation in order to achieve the\n            project development objective (PDO). The number of provinces\n            should be limited to a manageable size to ensure good\n            quality and project management.

The restructuring is designed to remedy both\n            problems, and to take into account the changed needs of the\n            Project, brought about by socio-economic, and environmental\n            changes in the Project area. The Project set out to\n            reestablish, and protect a vital natural resource (the\n            coastal mangrove forest), and to help poor people, who\n            currently depend on the forest, to move from the Full\n            Protection Zone (FPZ), resettle in the Buffer Zone (BZ), and\n            gain more sustainable livelihoods. Following the\n            restructuring mission, the Project made significant\n            achievements in two of the four provinces, indicating that\n            the objective not only remains valid, but is also\n            achievable. The restructuring of the Project will allow\n            these achievements to be consolidated, thereby protecting an\n            investment already made, and positioning the Project to\n            achieve a development goal of national importance. A\n            complete reassessment of reforestation, and other\n            interventions in the BZ is also being prepared, because of\n            major changes in land use, and land values since Project\n            appraisal. The expansion of physical infrastructure, and\n            agricultural development together, indicate that mangrove\n            reforestation is no longer feasible in many parts of the BZ.\n            On the basis of foregoing discussions on the merits of the\n            revised Project, it is recommended to approve the\n            restructuring of the Project, and the Development Credit\n            Agreement be amended as set forth in the attached Draft\n            Letter of Amendment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam -
