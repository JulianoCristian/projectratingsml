Some lessons learned included: there is\n            a need for a proper policy environment and a strong\n            political commitment to reform; project preparation teams\n            must be ready to question existing institutional\n            arrangements even when they seem to benefit from the support\n            of several key officials; there is a need for a\n            comprehensive approach to develop institutional capacity in\n            a sustainable manner; computerization of business processes\n            is a complex and challenging undertaking that needs a clear\n            strategy and proper planning; finally, the GEEP Project\n            illustrates the need to phase policy and institutional\n            changes not only for political feasibility reasons but also\n            because of the limited absorptive capacity of the public\n            service in most developing countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Management of the Petroleum
