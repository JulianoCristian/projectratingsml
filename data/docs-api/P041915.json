The objectives of the loan were to\n            accelerate growth and reduce poverty by assisting the\n            Government in: (i) implementing debt and debt service\n            reduction; (ii) consolidating fiscal balance and structural\n            reforms; and (iii) normalizing relations with commercial\n            creditors and re establishing creditworthines. Bank's\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was highly satisfactory. The key lessons learned\n            were as follows: (i) the success of the operation  depends\n            principally on the credibility of the country's\n            economic reform program; (ii) the concerted, menu-based\n            approach to debt reduction provides significant cost savings\n            to the debtor country compared to market-based debt\n            reduction; (iii) creditor banks also improve their financial\n            position; (iv) the inclusion of a new money option is not\n            essential for securing both full participation of creditors\n            and substantial cost savings; and (v) net benefits are\n            higher when DDSR is backed financially by the International\n            Financial Institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Debt

DDSR will substantially enhance the\n            effectiveness of the reform program in accelerating growth\n            to potential by: 1) substantially reducing market\n            uncertainty over Panama's ability and willingness to\n            fully service its external debt, and the sizable distortions\n            and costs this uncertainty entails; 2) offsetting the\n            adverse effect on the investment climate and flows deriving\n            from the disengagement of the U.S. from the Canal and former\n            Canal Zone; and 3) reducing the debt overhang and the\n            associated \"tax\" on future output. The project\n            consists of the following components: 1) an exchange of\n            original principal for par bonds, discount bonds,\n            front-loaded interest reduction bonds (FLIRB) or debt\n            conversion bonds; and 2) normalization of past due interest\n            (PDI) through partial forgiveness, PDI payments prior to\n            closing, a down payment on PDI at closing, and a PDI bond."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Debt and Debt Service Reduction\n            Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panama - Debt and Debt Service\n
