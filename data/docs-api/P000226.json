Most of the project objectives\n            were not met; however, several benefits were attained, such\n            as enterprise financing; progress of legal and regulatory\n            frameworks, through the preparation, and passing of major\n            legal texts, including the commercial code. Additionally,\n            private sector development institutions, banks and financial\n            institutions in particular, benefited from training and\n            capacity building activities. Despite the substantial work\n            initiated under the project, most was not implemented, such\n            as the expected development of private sector activities.\n            Macroeconomic imbalances increased during implementation,\n            posing high risk and uncertainties, which hindered private\n            investment development. The key lessons suggest that\n            extended caution should be taken for private sector\n            development operations to succeed, particularly where\n            political uncertainties persist. Thus in an environment\n            unlikely to combat inflation through fiscal discipline,\n            creditworthiness is not sustainable. These high risk factors\n            require a monitoring and evaluation system, critical to a\n            successful project supervision. Furthermore, public/private\n            sector partnerships are unlikely to succeed if controlled by\n            public entities, with poor knowledge of the private sector\n            needs. An overall management coordination would prevent\n            institutional problems, and foster implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Private Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi -
