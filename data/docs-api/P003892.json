The project's main objective was to increase\n            non-oil exports by providing support services for private\n            investments in the fisheries sector, while reducing\n            government subsidies. Bank performance has been deficient in\n            project identification, preparation assistance and\n            appraisal, but has been generally satisfactory in\n            supervision. Borrower's performance in preparing the\n            project has also been deficient and performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: a)\n            thorough project preparation is a prerequisite for\n            successful implementation; b) project agencies tend to work\n            closer together at lower levels of government; c) when\n            retaining private parties in a project, a suitable selection\n            procedure which takes into account competence and experience\n            should be followed; d) government should impress on shrimp\n            farmers not to intensify to make quick gains; e) land\n            titling under the national program should be accelerated;\n            and f) in terms of poverty alleviation the project would\n            have achieved more if its activities had focused more on\n            South East Sulawesi rather than South Sulawesi."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
