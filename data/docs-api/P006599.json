process its copper\n            ore and copper by-products; and (ii) to strengthen CODELCO\n            and ENAMI's management while also improving planning\n            and policy making within the sector. Individual subprojects\n            to be financed under the proposed loan include: (I) for\n            CODELCO: (a) an underground crushing plant, and related\n            infrastructure, at the El Teniente Mine; (b) rehabilitation\n            of the Barquito power plant which supplies the El Salvador\n            Mine and smelter facilities; (c) a selenium recovery plant\n            at Chuquicamata to process anode slimes from the\n            Chuquicamata and El Salvador Mines; and (d) technical\n            assistance. (II) For ENAMI: (a) the replacement of\n            antiquated or obsolete equipment at the Paipote and Ventanas\n            smelters and the modification of both smelters' burners\n            to enable them to operate on Chilean coal as well as\n            petroleum products; and (b) technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Copper Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chile - Copper Sector Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1976/01/1557511/chile-copper-sector-project","projn":"CL-Copper Sector Loan -- P006599","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Chile","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101902252649"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other industry","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,agricultural\n            output,agriculture,balance of payments,Bank lending,Bank\n            loans,Capital Grants,Central Bank,coal,coal\n            mining,comparative advantage,Consolidation,Copper,copper\n            mines,copper mining,copper ore,cost\n            savings,creditworthiness,current\n            prices,debt,deficits,deposits,development strategy,economic\n            growth,economic performance,economic policies,economic\n            situation,ei,employment,exchange rate,exchange\n            rates,Expenditures,exploitation,export\n            growth,exports,financial management,financial\n            performance,financial sector,Fiscal Year,foreign\n            exchange,Free\n            Trade,gas,GDP,heat,housing,imports,income,income\n            levels,inflation,interest rate,interest rates,international\n            reserves,inventory,Iron,Iron ore,labor force,market\n            prices,medium- scale mining,medium-scale mining,mines,mining\n            companies,Mining Company,mining industry,mining\n            operations,mining projects,mining sector,National\n            Mining,Oil,operating costs,price\n            controls,producers,productivity,Public Debt,real gross\n            domestic product,real income,real wages,refining,resource\n            base,savings,scale mining,small\n            mines,small-scale,small-scale mining,smelter,spare\n            parts,stabilization,state enterprises,subsidiaries,tariff\n            barriers,tax administration,tax rates,tax reform,technical\n            assistance,telecommunications,trade\n            deficit,transport,velocity of money,waste"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,agricultural\n            output,agriculture,balance of payments,Bank lending,Bank\n            loans,Capital Grants,Central Bank,coal,coal\n            mining,comparative advantage,Consolidation,Copper,copper\n            mines,copper mining,copper ore,cost\n            savings,creditworthiness,current\n            prices,debt,deficits,deposits,development strategy,economic\n            growth,economic performance,economic policies,economic\n            situation,ei,employment,exchange rate,exchange\n            rates,Expenditures,exploitation,export\n            growth,exports,financial management,financial\n            performance,financial sector,Fiscal Year,foreign\n            exchange,Free\n            Trade,gas,GDP,heat,housing,imports,income,income\n            levels,inflation,interest rate,interest rates,international\n            reserves,inventory,Iron,Iron ore,labor force,market\n            prices,medium- scale mining,medium-scale mining,mines,mining\n            companies,Mining Company,mining industry,mining\n            operations,mining projects,mining sector,National\n            Mining,Oil,operating costs,price\n            controls,producers,productivity,Public Debt,real gross\n            domestic product,real income,real wages,refining,resource\n            base,savings,scale mining,small\n            mines,small-scale,small-scale mining,smelter,spare\n            parts,stabilization,state enterprises,subsidiaries,tariff\n            barriers,tax administration,tax rates,tax reform,technical\n            assistance,telecommunications,trade\n            deficit,transport,velocity of money,waste"}},"owner":"WB Off:Buenos Aires-Southrn Cone (LCC7C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"P1741"},"facets":{}}}
