The locomotive spare\n            parts financed under the project did not yield the expected\n            benefits. Institutional development is rated as negligible.\n            The Bank's performance is rated as unsatisfactory as\n            supervision effectiveness was hampered by high staff\n            turnover and a lack of specialized skills. The\n            Borrower's performance was also unsatisfactory. The\n            failure to provide adequate project support indicated a lack\n            of full Borrower commitment to the project and account in\n            large part for the lack of achievement of the project. The\n            objectives of the project were only partly achieved. A\n            number of useful studies were performed which laid out some\n            of the foundation for the reform of transport parastatals,\n            covering actuarial and asset valuation, manpower\n            rationalization, policy formulation, and decision making for\n            transport parastatals. However, little was accomplished\n            toward improving the efficiency of the parastatals. The\n            three main lessons learned are: (i) a broad scope project\n            such as this one requires supervision missions carefully\n            balanced between persons with specialized skills and persons\n            of broad experience; (ii) Project Coordinating Units are not\n            suited to ensure internalization and follow-up of complex\n            reorganization studies, particularly in parastatals; and\n            (iii) adequate management tools and organizational changes\n            should be established ahead of project effectiveness to\n            generate measurable improvements of operating performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -
