The SSPSAC I has a satisfactory\n            outcome, and is likely to be sustainable. Both the\n            Bank's and Borrower's performance are\n            satisfactory. The outcome of the SSPCII is moderately\n            unsatisfactory and there is a significant risk to\n            development outcome. The performance of the Bank and\n            Borrower is moderately satisfactory. Among the lessons cited\n            for both operations were the following: 1) the programmatic\n            approach was a suitable instrument to help anchor policy in\n            a period of growing uncertainty and instability; 2) using\n            progress in a few selected Millennium Development Goals\n            (MDGs) as a theme provided a well focused overall objective;\n            3) clearer guidelines are needed for the role of supervision\n            when a Development Policy Lending (DPL) program is\n            interrupted; 4) the design of the monitoring system for this\n            operation could have been improved; 5) a stronger alliance\n            between the Ministry of Finance and line ministries and\n            agencies is critical for meeting agreed benchmarks; and 6)\n            the Bolivian context requires support for broad-based consensus-building."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Second Social Programmatic\n            Development Policy

of the Social Sector\n            Programmatic Development Policy Credit (SSPC) series\n            continues, through a Development Policy Credit (DPC)\n            operation, to support Bolivia's efforts in achieving\n            selected Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through the\n            implementation of a number of key social sector policies\n            designed during the first phase of this program. The SSPC II\n            will support social sector policies, with three broad goals\n            in mind: 1) protecting the positive results reached in the\n            last decade on increasing access to, and quality of health\n            and nutrition, education, water and sanitation, and social\n            protection; 2) implementing the sectoral policy frameworks\n            designed under the first phase of this programmatic series,\n            to continue the progress in social outcomes, and move closer\n            to achieving a number of specific MDGs by 2015; and, 3)\n            strengthening the capacity of both the Government, and civil\n            society to monitor, and evaluate policies, increasing\n            accountability and effectiveness. However, country risks\n            include, on the political side, the changing political\n            situation, and the potential social unrest, as reflected in\n            a steady number of protests; the uncertainty on the outcome\n            of the Hydrocarbons Law; the country's different views\n            on when, and if to call a Constitutional Assembly that would\n            discuss, among other things, regional autonomies; and, the\n            current crisis related to terminating the contract with the\n            company providing water and sanitation services in the\n            populous township of El Alto, adjacent to La Paz. In looking\n            at the economy, GDP growth remains vulnerable to external\n            shocks, notably rising commodity prices and interest rates,\n            while institutional weakness aggravate the situation. To\n            mitigate this, the Government made concerted efforts to\n            address the demands of protesters without resorting to the\n            use of force, and has developed and strengthened new\n            mechanisms for popular political participation. The Bank and\n            the international community have vigorously supported these efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Second Social Sector Programmatic\n            Development Policy Credit
