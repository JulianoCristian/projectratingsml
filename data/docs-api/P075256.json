The Pamir\n            Mountains, stretching through Tajikistan and Afghanistan,\n            are amongst the highest in the world and known since\n            Victorian times as the Roof of the World. The period\n            following independence, and the country's five year\n            civil war, people, economy and the environment suffered.\n            Schools, clinics and small businesses often closed in winter\n            because it was too cold to stay open. This inevitably\n            undermined economic development and affected wages, health\n            and education in the region. That changed when a\n            public-private partnership between the Government of\n            Tajikistan, and the World Bank Group put in place a new\n            Pamir Energy company that operates a renovated power plant\n            providing reliable electricity on a renovated grid. While\n            consumers and businesses in the Tajik Pamir have an almost\n            uninterrupted power supply, Pamir energy produces enough to\n            export its excess to northern Afghanistan. For the first\n            time, several Afghan villages in the Pamirs have\n            electricity, allowing schools to stay open and hospitals to\n            use technology. Pamir Energy company currently provides the\n            best and most reliable power supply services in Tajikistan,\n            with steady reduction of losses and increased collection of\n            electricity payments. Its consumers say access to reliable\n            electricity has revolutionized their lives. Residents say\n            the remote area is a beam of light on the Roof of the World,\n            thanks to a renovated electricity grid. The renovated grid\n            opens new opportunities for people and businesses to develop\n            further in Tajikistan's Pamir region as well as in\n            neighboring Afghan villages."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Beaming light on Tajikistan's Roof of\n            the World"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Beaming light on\n            Tajikistan's Roof of the World"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/04/25087084/beaming-light-tajikistans-roof-world","count":"Tajikistan","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"result, phone, technology, economic\n            development, communications, heat, businesses, business,\n            investment, network, private partnership, source of energy,\n            mobile phone, power, fuel, grid, electricity, cooking,\n            financial support, investments, hydropower, private\n            partnerships, power lines, electricity supply, commercial\n            entity, links, power supply, power project, electricity\n            tariffs, transmission, photo, electricity production,\n            environment, commodity, hydropower plant, energy consumers,\n            power plant, energy"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management,Rural development,Financial and private sector development","topic":"Natural Resources Management m1326215 600,Energy and Extractives m1326595 507,Power Systems m1327093 508,Environment and Natural Resources m1327391 566,Energy Efficiency m1326852 533,Energy Access m1325609 521","projn":"TJ-Pamir Private Power Project -- P075256","subtopic":"Power & Energy Conversion,E-Business,Energy Production and Transportation,Energy Demand,Energy and Environment","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Energy","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08310281e_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Power","theme":"Pollution management and environmental health,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Rural services and infrastructure","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Energy","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Natural Resources Management m1326215 600,Energy and Extractives m1326595 507,Power Systems m1327093 508,Environment and Natural Resources m1327391 566,Energy Efficiency m1326852 533,Energy Access m1325609 521","owner":"Energy & Extractives - GP (GEEDR)","trustfund":"TFS50589-TAJIKISTAN PAMIR PRIVATE POWER PROJECT,TFM50589-Tajikistan Pamir Private Power Project,TF050589-TAJIKISTAN PAMIR PRIVATE POWER PROJECT,TF035611-GLOBAL - CLIMATE CHNAGE","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"1":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"2":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"3":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"4":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"}},"repnb":"94054"},"15650503":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/06/15650503/tajikistan-pamir-private-power-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/06/15650503/tajikistan-pamir-private-power-project","new_url":"2011/06/15650503/tajikistan-pamir-private-power-project","disclosure_date":"2012-01-23T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-01-23T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-01-23T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/01/23/000333037_20120123001157/Rendered/INDEX/ICR15130P075250C0disclosed010190120.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/01/23/000333037_20120123001157/Rendered/PDF/ICR15130P075250C0disclosed010190120.pdf","credit_no":"3682;H381","docdt":"2011-06-28T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2012-01-23T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan - Pamir Private Power Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Pamir Private Power\n            Project for Tajikistan were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: given the difficult environment in which the Pamir\n            Energy project placed, the goals set for the project, and\n            the limited resources available, high quality management was\n            always a pre-requisite for success.
