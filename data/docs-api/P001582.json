Key lessons learned include: 1) Lack of client\n            ownership of reforms will lead to their reversal. The SAC\n            did prove to be an invaluable vehicle for advancing the\n            development dialogue in Madagascar during times of political\n            turmoil and economic reform backtracking. Through the\n            preparation stage of the operation, the Bank used the\n            potential credit as a means to engage the pro-reform\n            elements in Madagascar and tailored its pitch to the\n            political leadership when receptive or to analytical work\n            when dialogue was slow. 2) The SAC should be viewed as a\n            combination of the specific measures that were taken prior\n            to Board presentation, and the commitments under the Letter\n            of Development Policy to continue to execute the reforms.\n            Bank adjustment operations shift towards the use of floating\n            tranches, particularly in cases where the reform program is\n            multi-faceted, and therefore subject to a differentiated\n            pace of implementation. Conditionality should be specified\n            in ways in which results are clearly identified and\n            rewarded. 3) The operations reinforce the by-now-accepted\n            view that weak institutional capacity needs to be fully\n            factored into program design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Structural Adjustment Credit
