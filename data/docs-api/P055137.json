competitive enterprise and market development and\n            impose financial discipline on the enterprise sector; and b)\n            have a major direct impact on macroeconomic stability. It\n            will focus on fiscal management reform, private sector\n            development, reform of infrastructure monopolies, and\n            banking reforms. The loan will encourage and enable the\n            federal government to proceed with key structural reforms to\n            sustain macroeconomic stability and stimulate renewed\n            growth. The low-cost, non-inflationary budget financing\n            provided will confer financial savings as well as economic\n            benefits. The reforms supported will increase efficiency\n            across a range of sectors by helping create a more\n            competitive and open private sector-oriented economy. The\n            risk of macroeconomic instability has been addressed through\n            the operation's strong fiscal management measures, the\n            resources it will provide to the economy, and through\n            coordinating closely with the International Monetary\n            Fund's ongoing Extended Fund Facility program. The risk\n            of erratic commitment to reforms has been addressed by\n            designing SAL3 based on strong prior actions and\n            incorporating three progressive tranches. The risk of\n            inadequate implementation of the reforms will be addressed\n            through intensive supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russia - Third Structural Adjustment Loan
