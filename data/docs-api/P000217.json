Country circumstances made it impossible for the\n            project actors to carry out their activities. Cofinanciers\n            also suspended their participation in 1996. The most\n            important lesson learned from the difficult history of the\n            project is that even in conflict situations, it is possible\n            to restructure projects and to achieve high impact by\n            concentrating on the most basic level of services and using\n            adapted and low-cost solutions. Another related lesson is\n            that in crisis situations, a bottom-up approach is more\n            likely to succeed. Delegating implementation\n            responsibilities to dedicated nongovernemtnal organizations\n            also may restore a degree of trust that governmental bodies\n            are unable to inspire. Moreover, building on the\n            achievements of a \"highly satisfactory\" project\n            does not warrant the success of a follow-up operation and\n            does not automatically warrant that the quality at entry\n            will be satisfactory. The design and implementation of cost\n            recovery policies for rural water services should bring\n            users in the picture through willingness-to-pay studies and\n            social assessments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi -
