Some lessons learned\n            included: during implementation, it is important for the\n            Bank team to include required skills blend. For several\n            years during implementation, the Bank team did not include a\n            road engineer and this limited the outputs from site visits\n            and thus the team\u0092s ability to carry out its due diligence\n            responsibility. An assessment of the local construction\n            industry should be carried out during preparation of a\n            project with significant civil works activities particularly\n            if several operations are needed. Findings and\n            recommendations of such analysis should then be used to\n            determine actions under the project to ensure adequate\n            participation of the local construction industry in project\n            implementation. Such a study should have been part of\n            project preparation or included in the Additional Financing\n            (AF) given the difficulties being experienced in adequately\n            involving the local construction industry in the civil\n            works. During preparation of new projects with the same\n            implementing agency, the Bank should be aware of the impact\n            on the ability of the agency to effectively implement all of\n
