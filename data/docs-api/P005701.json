The objectives of this project were to:\n            (i) help the Agence de Maitrise de l'Energie (AME)\n            develop an effective institutional and policy framework for\n            a national energy conservation program; (ii) strengthen\n            local capabilities for monitoring the program and\n            implementing energy efficiency audits and actions; and (iii)\n            finance short-term actions to demonstrate energy\n            conservation. Energy conservation was important, realistic,\n            and necessary, in view of Tunisia's expected dependence\n            on energy imports. A stronger institutional and policy\n            framework was essential for sustainability. However, the\n            financing objective was unrealistic because of complexity\n            for AME. Moreover, project design was flawed: (a) a Bank\n            loan was not an appropriate instrument since the project was\n            noncommercial; (b) the loan amount was too small to achieve\n            all of the project's objectives; and (c) technical\n            assistance should have been provided throughout the project\n            to AME. The project had four components. An institutional\n            component providedtechnical assistance to AME, training in\n            basic energy auditing and conservation techniques, and\n            equipment for training and demonstration. Demonstration\n            components in three sectors (industrial, transportation and\n            hotel/buildings) included energy audits, feasibility\n            studies, implementationof the recommended energy-saving\n            actions, on-the-job training in energy conservation, and\n            tools, equipment and/or instrumentation. The key lessons to\n            be drawn from the problems of this project relate both to\n            design and to implementation. The lessons from the design\n            flaws are:(i) the appropriate instrument for non-commercial\n            projects such as this would have been a grant, not a Bank\n            loan; (ii) the Bank should ensure in making small loans that\n            the amount is realistic to achieve the stated objectives;\n            (iii) the Bank should ensure the institutional framework\n            remains satisfactory by monitoring the achievement of\n            institutional objectives (this includes establishing\n            indicators), and should provide technical assistance\n            throughout the project to foster and maintain institutional\n            capacity; and (iv) the Bank should provide strong\n            justification when the timetable at appraisal differs\n            significantly from the country's average disbursement profile."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Energy Conservation Demonstration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Energy Conservation\n            Demonstration Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/04/733915/tunisia-energy-conservation-demonstration-project","topic":"Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Conservation Finance m1326426 588,Energy Efficiency in Industry m1326602 538,Energy and Extractives m1326595 507,Private Sector Development m1326060 1921","projn":"TN-Energy Con.
