Ratings for the Third Development Policy Loan\n            Project were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the Indonesia DPL series can be characterized by the\n            numerous prior actions that were highly specific and covered\n            a broad range of policy areas, which is a different model\n            than the standard Bank practice for fewer but key headline\n            reforms. Given the political sensitivities to conditional\n            lending at the time of first DPL, the latter was not really\n            a feasible option. Rather it is likely that if the Bank had\n            instead pursued high profile reforms, the DPL series would\n            not have garnered the support it currently holds.\n            Undoubtedly, the Indonesia model makes the loan processing\n            more complicated as it involved numerous key players, both\n            on the Bank and government side. However it was an approach\n            that was supported by the government and did succeed in\n            advancing the reform agenda on several fronts. In this\n            respect, the Indonesia DPL series offers several key lessons\n            for future operations as well as for those countries that\n            are seeking a more collaborative engagement with client\n            countries.  In this respect, the Bank's heavy field\n            presence enabled it to interact frequently with the\n            government, not just on the DPL but in other related\n            engagements that supported the DPL policy areas. This in\n            turn afforded the government the ability to appoint high\n            level counterparts to ensure that the triggers would be met,\n            as their mandate was not just narrowly focused on the DPL\n            reform triggers but also in the broader engagement. As a\n            result, the appointment and socialization of high-ranking\n            motivated counterparts greatly enabled pushing through the\n            triggers and ensuring the loan could be delivered."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - First, Second, Third, and Fourth\n            Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - First, Second, Third,\n

         and from stabilization to development. The loan supports the\n            Government's public policy statements and agenda in key\n            economic areas with a specific focus on maintaining\n            macroeconomic stability, enhancing the investment climate,\n            and improving public financial management and\n            anti-corruption. In addition, it provides vital financing at\n            a critical stage and provides an effective vehicle for the\n            Bank to engage the new administration. The expected results\n            of this approach include sustained macro stability, an\n            improved investment climate, greater government\n            accountability, and improved public services for the poor.\n            The proposed DPL supports the policy reforms in the\n            following areas: Macroeconomic stability and\n            creditworthiness: The administration has indicated its\n            commitment to build on the fiscal discipline achieved, and a\n            willingness to address problematic issues in subsidies, tax\n            compliance, and inter-governmental fiscal transfers.\n            Investment climate: The administration has expressed its\n            commitment to continued tax and customs reforms, given the\n            problems in these areas. Public financial management and\n            anti-corruption: The administration is committed to\n            continuing fiduciary and budget reforms through, and among\n            other actions, issuing implementing regulations for several\n            laws, establishing a Treasury Single Account, and\n            strengthening the Inspector General's office. By 2007,\n            these reforms are expected to result in significant\n            improvements to budgeting and transparency, and\n            accountability in public financial management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
