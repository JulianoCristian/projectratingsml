Some lessons learned included: the\n            issue of capacity is critical and the scale of need is\n            enormous, but appreciation of the problem is low. Water\n            Users Organization (WUO) need to improve their capacity to\n            plan, organize and manage their irrigation infrastructure\n            and agricultural production systems, especially in a context\n            of rapidly changing institutional and legal frameworks, and\n            agricultural markets. In order to have a sustainable\n            capacity building system that can count on reliable and\n            realistic funding, it is recommended to address the\n            potential role of different players in its design,\n            methodologies, funding sources (water users,\n            non-governmental organization (NGO), public and private\n            sector, international cooperation) and other support\n            mechanisms.

There is a remote\n            possibility that the execution of project works may cause\n            significant damage to natural resources, environmental\n            preservation and conservation. Nonetheless, some of the\n            environmental impacts are : damage to historic cultural\n            heritage areas; use of agro-chemical products; noise, dust\n            and air pollution from vehicular and construction\n            activities; and potential soil erosion, destruction of\n            landscape, and vegetation. Mitigation measures are :\n            vehicles to comply with local municipality noise and air\n            quality regulations; reject of works with pre-investment\n            studies that lack environmental impact study; stop works\n            whose technical drawings indicate they affect\n            historic-cultural sites; organize community outreach and\n            public awareness campaigns on environmental management\n            issues; affected land and vegetation will be restored by\n            soil leveling and covering grass; and finally; promote the\n            application of adequate agronomic practices and train\n            farmers in pesticide management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental management plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Irrigation Sub-Sector\n            Supplemental Project : Environmental management plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/04/5799794/peru-irrigation-sub-sector-supplemental-project-environmental-management-plan","projn":"PE-Irrigation Sub-Sector Supplemental\n            Project -- P094152","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Water Resources Law,Water Use,Water Law,Agricultural Research,Agricultural Irrigation and Drainage","teratopic":"Water Resources,Law and Development,Agriculture","count":"Peru","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000011823_20050513153257"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Irrigation and drainage,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Law and Development,Agriculture","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural production, AGRICULTURE,\n            animals, canals, crops, dam safety, diseases, environmental\n            impact, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, environmental protection,\n            ENVIRONMENTAL RISK, farmers, flooding, gravity irrigation,\n            hydraulic structures, irrigated agriculture, IRRIGATION,\n            irrigation infrastructure, irrigation system, irrigation\n            systems, irrigation users, Irrigation Water, land use,\n            natural resources, pest control, pests, programs, public\n            irrigation systems, salinization, sanitation, soils,\n            Stabilization, water rights"}},"owner":"Environment (LCSEN)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"E1164"},"6070426":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2005/04/6070426/peru-irrigation-subsector-project-supplemental-loan","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2005/04/6070426/peru-irrigation-subsector-project-supplemental-loan","new_url":"2005/04/6070426/peru-irrigation-subsector-project-supplemental-loan","disclosure_date":"2005-05-15T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/07/18/000012009_20050718094644/Rendered/INDEX/323530rev.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/07/18/000012009_20050718094644/Rendered/PDF/323530rev.pdf","docdt":"2005-04-28T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2005-07-18T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Gray cover","versiontyp_key":"1309938","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Peru - Irrigation Subsector Project -\n            Supplemental Loan"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The additional financing will partially\n            compensate for the US$30 million, reallocated from the\n            original loan for the emergency rehabilitation of irrigation\n            infrastructure, damaged by the 1998 El Nino disaster.
