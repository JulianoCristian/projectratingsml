- Narmada river development - Gujarat"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Prior to Independence, the Narmada River\n            Basin area was mainly divided between a number of Princely\n            states which lacked the, planning, technical, and fiscal\n            capabilities to undertake the major works involved in\n            regulating the river . In the 1950's and 1960's,\n            ambitious, Flaps were drawn up for development of the\n            Narmada River but most of the plans were held up because of\n            inter-state disputes over the allocation of water. Thus,\n            today, the water resource remains virtually undeveloped.\n            This annex describes the planning process of the total\n            Narmada river development -- Gujarat or the Sardar Sarovar\n            Project (SSP) and the development as presently envisaged.\n            The complexity of the project and the many direct and\n            indirect ways in which it will affect the welfare of the\n            people of the beneficiary states, required a\n            multi-disciplinary planning approach. Further complicating\n            the planning process is the time frame of 22 years over\n            which the project would be implemented and during which many\n            unforeseen events may take place. Thus, the planners faced\n            the challenge of planning with uncertainty.

The projects will install 1,450 MW of\n            hydroelectric generating capacity and associated\n            transmission facilities.  They will further irrigate about\n            1.9 million ha in Gujarat and create the potential for the\n            irrigation of about 70,000 ha in Rajasthan.  Finally, the\n            projects will supply about 1,300 million cubic meters per\n            annum of municipal and industrial water."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Narmada River Development - Gujarat\n            : Water Delivery and Drainage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Narmada River Development\n            - Gujarat : Water Delivery and Drainage Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/02/741537/india-narmada-river-development-gujarat-water-delivery-drainage-project","projn":"IN-Narmada (Gujarat) Ca -- P009830","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Water Use,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry,Water Supply and Systems","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970904163010"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"acre-feet,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,allocation\n            of water,Aquifer,augmentation,basin,Basin\n            Development,basins,Canals,carrying water,central\n            government,Competitive Bidding,Conjunctive\n            Use,Construction,COST RECOVERY,Cost Sharing,covering,Crop\n            Production,Crop Yields,cubic meter,cubic\n            meters,Dams,dissolved solids,distribution\n            facilities,distribution system,domestic\n            water,Drainage,drainage channels,Drainage\n            Systems,Drawdown,drought,flooding,flow\n            control,gravity,Groundwater,groundwater\n            development,groundwater resource,Groundwater\n            Resources,groundwater table,hydraulics,hydroelectric\n            power,hydroelectric power\n            generation,hydrology,hydropower,hydropower\n            capacity,hydropower plants,industrial uses,industrial\n            water,Irrigation,irrigation development,irrigation\n            project,irrigation systems,irrigation use,irrigation\n            water,Maintenance Costs,major water resource,ponds,poor\n            water quality,Power Generation,public wells,pump\n            stations,pumping,pumps,remote\n            sensing,reservoirs,rivers,runoff,subsurface water,Surface\n            drainage,Surface Water,Surface Water Resources,Thermal\n            Power,variable rainfall,water,Water Allocation,water\n            availability,water conveyance,Water Delivery,water\n            demand,water development,water distribution,water\n            needs,Water Quality,Water Rates,water resource,Water\n            storage,water supplies,Water Supply,Water Supply\n            Facilities,Water Use,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"acre-feet,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,allocation\n            of water,Aquifer,augmentation,basin,Basin\n            Development,basins,Canals,carrying water,central\n            government,Competitive Bidding,Conjunctive\n            Use,Construction,COST RECOVERY,Cost Sharing,covering,Crop\n            Production,Crop Yields,cubic meter,cubic\n            meters,Dams,dissolved solids,distribution\n            facilities,distribution system,domestic\n            water,Drainage,drainage channels,Drainage\n            Systems,Drawdown,drought,flooding,flow\n            control,gravity,Groundwater,groundwater\n            development,groundwater resource,Groundwater\n            Resources,groundwater table,hydraulics,hydroelectric\n            power,hydroelectric power\n            generation,hydrology,hydropower,hydropower\n            capacity,hydropower plants,industrial uses,industrial\n            water,Irrigation,irrigation development,irrigation\n            project,irrigation systems,irrigation use,irrigation\n            water,Maintenance Costs,major water resource,ponds,poor\n            water quality,Power Generation,public wells,pump\n            stations,pumping,pumps,remote\n            sensing,reservoirs,rivers,runoff,subsurface water,Surface\n            drainage,Surface Water,Surface Water Resources,Thermal\n            Power,variable rainfall,water,Water Allocation,water\n            availability,water conveyance,Water Delivery,water\n            demand,water development,water distribution,water\n            needs,Water Quality,Water Rates,water resource,Water\n            storage,water supplies,Water Supply,Water Supply\n            Facilities,Water Use,wells"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"5108"},"facets":{}}}
