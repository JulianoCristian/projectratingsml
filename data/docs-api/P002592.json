Further to this, the\n            project aims to finance (iv) studies on (a) privatization of\n            management of irrigation schemes on the Nile; (b)\n            preparation of a national irrigation rehabilitation program;\n            (c) development of the edible oil subsector, and (d)\n            rehabilitation of gum arabic plantations.  In the short\n            term, the project would sustain production in the irrigated\n            subsector, support Government's stabilization program\n            and pave the way for a more comprehensive economic recovery\n            program.  In the medium term, it would improve the financial\n            and accounting performance of agricultural parastatals and\n            the operating efficiency of the Ministries of Agriculture\n            and Irrigation.  Finally, in the long term, it would protect\n            the environment from contamination from chemical pesticides,\n            and assist with resolution of issues that prevent full\n            exploitation of Sudan's irrigation potential."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan - Third Agricultural Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sudan - Third Agricultural\n
