The overall performances of both\n            the Bank and the Borrower are graded satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned included the following: 1) Programmatic lending\n            serves as a useful vehicle for economy-wide reforms. This\n            instrument is particularly advantageous in structuring\n            complex dialogue dealing with the whole government (and\n            therefore across sectors), and in encouraging meaningful and\n            precise progress over a well-defined time frame. Overcoming\n            roadblocks, however, requires a frank and lucid evaluation\n            of the Bank-country relationship-specifically, expectations\n            of the durability and outcomes of the reform beyond the\n            years considered under the program. 2) It is essential to\n            develop monitoring and evaluation capacity-for evaluating\n            both the progress of policies and programs underpinning the\n            entire reform program. 3) A major part of the\n            Government's analytical work (and Bank's Economic\n            and Sector work) should focus on developing a\n            performance-oriented budgeting system with a view to\n            improving the efficiency of public expenditure management.\n            4) Public Sector Reform Loans (PSRLs) are being implemented\n            by several ministries and agencies, and requires overall\n            coordination and monitoring. Here, coordination does not\n            mean \"command and control,\" rather ensuring\n            long-term complementarity among the various components of\n            the program. In this context, there is a need for creating a\n            working group under the present inter-ministerial\n            coordinating committee. This working group should be\n            concerned with more than just monitoring and reporting; it\n            should assure that the content of the various measures are\n            aligned from the outset. Lastly, this working group should\n            also be instrumental in setting up a process that allows the\n            sharing and exchange of information and ideas. 5) For the\n            program to achieve a substantive institutional development\n            impact, it is important to interlink the various components\n            of the program. To date, most of the progress has been\n            achieved through pursuing parallel tracks. Now the reform\n            program needs to focus on integrating the various elements\n            (e.g., costing of government services, simplifying\n            procedures, establishing a judicial information network). 6)\n            PSRLs require a shift from an approach that focuses mostly\n            on lending toward one that emphasizes policy dialogue\n            underpinned by economic and sector work."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Second Public Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Second Public Sector\n            Reform

Disbursements will\n            be on the basis of satisfactory progress in the public\n            sector management program, measured by actions improving the\n            Government's institutional capacity, and incentives to\n            deliver quality public services, as well as on the continued\n            sound overall macroeconomic management. While the project\n            will contribute in maintaining a stronger financial position\n            to face economic, and political shocks, the continuing\n            uncertainty in the Middle East could risk implementation of\n            programs as described above. However, Jordan's past\n            record demonstrates its strong, and sound economic, and\n            political performance which far outweighs those risks.\n            Moreover, the inherent long-term and comprehensive nature of\n            public sector reforms, entails a slow implementation, whose\n            fragmentation may jeopardize its coherency. Nonetheless, the\n            appointment of an inter-ministerial steering committee, and\n            the continued dialogue with the Bank, as well as other\n            external partners, suggests
