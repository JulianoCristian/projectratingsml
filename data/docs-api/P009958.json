Project sustainability is assessed as\n            likely. Both World Bank and Borrower performances are rated\n            satisfactory overall. General lessons learned from this\n            project include the following: Studies to prepare a\n            perspective plan for development, reviews of public\n            expenditure, and mandate and manpower policies of the\n            concerned agencies were critical for designing meaningful\n            policy interventions and institutional development. These\n            studies should always precede project information. The\n            legislation required to make operational the institutional\n            arrangements for the sharing of costs and benefits of\n            community forest management was absent. As a result, the\n            implementation of joint forest management within the project\n            was not possible, despite important attitudinal shifts in\n            favor of community involvement in forestry activities.\n            Disseminating information on commercial trade in pesticides\n            removed the conflict of interest between the sale of\n            pesticides and the promotion of biological control.\n            Involving the beneficiaries-particularly women-as caretakers\n            in operation and maintenance of the rural drinking water\n            supply ensured this component's sustainability.\n            Identifying monitoring indicators and undertaking baseline\n            surveys was crucial to obtaining meaningful interpretation\n            of project implementation progress."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Agricultural Development Project -\n            Tamil Nadu"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Agricultural Development\n
