The lessons learned\n            indicate that a broad Project design compatible and\n            supportive of an overall National Competitiveness Strategy\n            contributed to the Project's success. Close\n            coordination with the private sector can enhance project\n            success. Private-Public sector collaboration can be\n            strengthened by creating a high-level Coordination Group\n            supported by a Technical Secretariat to help implement\n            reforms. Broad competitiveness operations are complex and\n            risky. Careful attention to supervision and private sector\n            involvement are useful in reducing risk. Modernizing the\n            legal framework should be the first step in institutional\n            development. The order and timeliness of reforms can alter\n            the efficacy of outcomes.
