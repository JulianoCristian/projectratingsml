The project comprises\n            elements of policy reform as well as investments. Policy\n            reforms will focus on modification of the institutional\n            framework to eliminate restrictive regulations in the\n            transport sector, and support rationalization of transport\n            and power tariffs. On the investment side, the project will\n            support the purchase of buses, vehicles and spare parts, as\n            well as construction of a new workshop. Also financed will\n            be transformers, conductors, meters and other equipment for\n            reducing losses and rehabilitating the power sector.\n            Finally, the project will finance technical assistance and\n            studies to help strengthen institutions in both the power\n            and transport sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde - Infrastructure Rehabilitation\n            and Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cape Verde - Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/08/737632/cape-verde-infrastructure-rehabilitation-technical-assistance-project","projn":"CV-Infras Rehab -- P000431","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Engineering,Municipal Financial Management,Roads & Highways","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Cabo Verde","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926175707"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            records,afforestation,assets,auditing,auditors,audits,autonomy,biogas,bottleneck,buses,charcoal,covers,crude\n            oil,debt,deposits,drilling,Economic Development,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,Electrification,energy conservation,energy\n            sources,exchange rate,Expenditures,exploitation,fares,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fishing,foreign exchange,framework,freight\n            transport,fuel,fuels,fuelwood,generators,geothermal\n            energy,Highway maintenance,imports,inventory,Land\n            transport,management information\n            systems,maturity,municipalities,oil,operating\n            costs,operating ratio,petroleum,petroleum\n            products,pickups,ports,power generation,power\n            plants,pressure,productivity,Public Enterprises,public\n            transportation,Public Works,Rate of\n            Return,Reinforcement,renewable energy sources,road\n            construction,road maintenance,road system,road\n            transport,road transport industry,roads,routine\n            maintenance,safety,savings,solar\n            energy,speed,subsidiary,Technical\n            Assistance,terrain,tires,tools,topography,transformers,Transport,vegetation,vehicle\n            operating costs,vehicles,water supply,wind,wind energy"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            records,afforestation,assets,auditing,auditors,audits,autonomy,biogas,bottleneck,buses,charcoal,covers,crude\n            oil,debt,deposits,drilling,Economic Development,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,Electrification,energy conservation,energy\n            sources,exchange rate,Expenditures,exploitation,fares,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fishing,foreign exchange,framework,freight\n            transport,fuel,fuels,fuelwood,generators,geothermal\n            energy,Highway maintenance,imports,inventory,Land\n            transport,management information\n            systems,maturity,municipalities,oil,operating\n            costs,operating ratio,petroleum,petroleum\n            products,pickups,ports,power generation,power\n            plants,pressure,productivity,Public Enterprises,public\n            transportation,Public Works,Rate of\n            Return,Reinforcement,renewable energy sources,road\n            construction,road maintenance,road system,road\n            transport,road transport industry,roads,routine\n            maintenance,safety,savings,solar\n            energy,speed,subsidiary,Technical\n            Assistance,terrain,tires,tools,topography,transformers,Transport,vegetation,vehicle\n            operating costs,vehicles,water supply,wind,wind energy"}},"owner":"WB:Dakar-FmcAFR1:SN/CV/CM/GW/MR (AFCF1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"P4749"},"facets":{}}}
