The ratings for the Financial Sector Adjustment\n            Loan (FSAL) Project for Ukraine were as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was negligible\n            to low; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Major lessons from FSAL\n            are the importance of a sound legislative and regulatory\n            framework in the financial system, and the greater role of\n            the country's overall economic performance, as well as\n            market forces, than of formal technical assistance, in\n            achieving improvements in specific financial institutions.\n            In particular:, (i) establishing a sound legislative and\n            regulatory framework for the financial sector is a\n            necessary, but not sufficient, condition for financial\n            sector development; (ii) strengthening the supervisory and\n            enforcement capacity of the supervisory agency is essential\n            to achieve the benefits of a sound legal and regulatory\n            frame; (iii) technical assistance to strengthen poor\n            performing institutions has poor results without a strong\n            demand-pull, mainly from market forces; and (iv)\n            restructuring and improving the performance of state-owned\n            financial institutions is a slow and risky proposition in a\n            poor governance environment. The ratings for the First and\n            Second Programmatic Adjust Loan projects (PAL I and PAL II)\n            are as follows: outcome sustainability was satisfactory,\n            risk to development outcome was negligible to low, Bank\n            performance for PAL I was satisfactory while it was\n            moderately satisfactory for PAL II.  Three major categories\n            of lessons emerge from this assessment of the PAL program:\n            links and complementarity between the PAL program and\n            investment lending need reinforcing, politically difficult\n            issues are noticeable during the early stages of program\n            implementation and when crucial to the success of the\n            program should

needs to be continually improved. The World Bank\n            is working to create a system of credit ratings, which is\n            widely developed in the entire financial world. This system\n            will facilitate enhancing enterprise transparency. Within\n            the framework of the World Bank Financial sector reform\n            project (1998-2001), the government developed and adopted a\n            law that has considerably extended the powers of the\n            National Bank of Ukraine, related to supervising the banking\n            system. One of the main requirements of the Bank for\n            allocating a United States (U.S.) 260 million dollars loan\n            for Ukraine, a greater part of which the government used for\n            social payments, was to establish a fund for guaranteeing\n            natural persons' deposits. The development of the new\n            law on banks and banking activities, with the participation\n            of the World Bank experts, and its adoption in 2001, made\n            the banks capitalization requirements more stringent, and\n            over the past four years the banking system capital has\n            almost doubled. In 1996, the World Bank extended to Ukraine\n            a loan for reforming the financial markets - the export\n            development project for the amount of U.S. 70 million\n            dollars. This project provided for assistance to support\n            exporters\u0092 production and promoted the development of the\n            state Export-Import Bank. The World Bank favors\n            strengthening the positions of the regulatory body and\n            supports increased financing of this body at the expense of\n            market participants. Within the framework of the rural\n            development project, the World Bank plans to involve\n            experienced and stable banks in crediting projects for rural areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"World Bank projects in financial sector"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"World Bank projects in financial sector"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2004/04/23955306/world-bank-projects-financial-sector","count":"Ukraine","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to credit, accounting, Auditing, bank\n            credits, banking system, bankrupt, banks, borrower, Cabinet\n            of Ministers, capitalization, commercial banks, credit\n            bureaus, credit histories, credit line, credit ratings,\n            credit unions, creditors, depositor, depositors, deposits,\n            disbursement, domestic market, expenditures, exporters,\n            financial companies, financial crisis, financial\n            institutions, financial intermediaries, financial market,\n            financial markets, Financial Sector, Financial Sector\n            Reform, Financial Services, growth rates, information\n            technologies, insurance, insurance companies, insurance\n            market, insurance reform, interest rate, international\n            standards, large cities, laws, level of risk, level of\n            risks, leverages, life insurance, life insurance companies,\n            loan, market participants, National Bank, natural persons,\n            new products, pension, Pension Funds, pension system,\n            regulator, regulatory body, Savings, Savings Bank, state\n            banks, subsidiaries, transparency"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Economic management,Financial and private sector development","topic":"Financial Laws and Regulations m1327714 853,Financial Risk Reduction m1327140 1973,Financial Sector and Social Inclusion\n            m1326074 374,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Financial Risk Management m1326072 375","projn":"UA-Fsd Dialogue/Ta -- P071281,UA-Financial Sector Structural Adjustment\n            Loan -- P040560","subtopic":"Corporate Law,Banks & Banking Reform,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Emerging Markets,Debt Markets","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Law and Development,Private Sector Development","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150204152335"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Banking,(Historic)Financial sector development,Central government administration","theme":"Macroeconomic management,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Regulation and competition policy,Other economic management","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Law and Development,Private Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA,Technical Assistance (Non-lending)","topicv3":"Financial Laws and Regulations m1327714 853,Financial Risk Reduction m1327140 1973,Financial Sector and Social Inclusion\n            m1326074 374,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Financial Risk Management m1326072 375","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C"],"trustfund":"TF023158-UKRAINE-FINANCIAL SECTOR\n            DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM,TF033115-UKRAINE -

The absence of a unified vision on what financial\n            sector reform is meant to achieve, led to wasted, project\n            implementation efforts, where actions promoted by one part\n            of the Administration, hindered the intentions of other\n            government entities. Such results, and the obvious need for\n            an integrated government approach that ensures the benefits\n            of economic reforms, promoted the implementation of a new\n            inter-agency, the Financial Sector Policy Board, established\n            at the end of the year 2000."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine -
