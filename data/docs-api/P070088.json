The project also supports the\n            enforcement of several international conventions relating to\n            the environment. There are four main project components. The\n            first improves customs procedures by aligning them with\n            European Union standards and developing a monitoring\n            mechanism; provides training on new procedures; and\n            designates border and inland customs stations to serve as\n            test sites for ideas to improve operations. The second\n            component supports trade facilitation by strengthening the\n            private-public partnership and improves the performance of\n            trade facilitation agents. The third component improves the\n            customs information system by using electronic messaging\n            system, making electronic payment of duties, using digital\n            signature--including the selection of the most appropriate\n            translator and digital signature software, implementing\n            computer valuation and tariff classification systems, and\n            upgrading to a web-based system. It also increases the\n            number of computers and printers, purchases Internet service\n            servers, provides technology software, and upgrades\n            infrastructure for servers.

To\n            prevent, minimize, or mitigate site specific negative\n            impacts, however, this environmental management plan (EMP)\n            and a set of mitigation measures have been prepared. The\n            major concerns about possible negative site specific impacts\n            associated with border crossings relate to 1) emissions from\n            vehicles waiting for custom clearances; 2) drainage of\n            disinfectants and spills of oils and fuel; 3) waste disposal\n            and loose garbage; and 4) site disruptions caused by\n            upgrades or relocations of utilities or such infrastructure\n            as buildings, parking/waiting areas, and access roads.\n            Specific actions to minimize any potentially negative impact\n            and promote institutional development include liaising with\n            environmental authorities and reviewing and monitoring EMP\n            compliance; staff training and sensitization at each border\n            crossing; certifying acceptable practices and impact\n            minimization, especially storing and properly using\n            disinfecting materials and chemicals, and hazardous\n            materials and garbage; harmonizing regulatory requirements\n            with European Union and international standards; and\n            incorporating environmental plans in consultant contracts\n            and project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Trade and Transport Facilitation\n            in Southeast Europe : environmental management plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Croatia - Trade and Transport\n            Facilitation in Southeast Europe : environmental management plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/02/438121/croatia-trade-transport-facilitation-southeast-europe-environmental-management-plan","projn":"HR-Trade & Transport Facilitation In\n            South East Europe-458622 -- P070088","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Environmental Governance,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Croatia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00031505333330"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to\n            information,Construction,drainage,emissions,Endangered\n            Species,environmental agencies,environmental\n            assessments,Environmental Authorities,environmental\n            compliance,environmental impact,environmental\n            impacts,Environmental issues,environmental\n            management,environmental officer,environmental\n            regulations,garbage,hazardous materials,Hazardous\n            Wastes,laws,mitigation measures,potential\n            threat,streams,waste,waste disposal"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to\n            information,Construction,drainage,emissions,Endangered\n            Species,environmental agencies,environmental\n            assessments,Environmental Authorities,environmental\n            compliance,environmental impact,environmental\n            impacts,Environmental issues,environmental\n            management,environmental officer,environmental\n            regulations,garbage,hazardous materials,Hazardous\n            Wastes,laws,mitigation measures,potential\n            threat,streams,waste,waste disposal"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF038544-ALBANIA:  TRADE &\n            TRANSPORTATION FACILITATION,TF024042-BNPP-TRADE: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE,TF040163-ALBANIA: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE - PROCURM,TF040162-ABLANIA: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SE EUROPE - PROJECT LAUNCH,TF039898-ROMANIA-TRANSPORT AND TRADE\n            FACILITIES IN SE EUROPE,TF037984-ECA REGION - TRADE AND TRANS.
