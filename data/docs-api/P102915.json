Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) embedding the policy reforms, including the\n            prior actions, in the government's reform agenda as\n            articulated in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            (I-PRSP), the RRSP encouraged strong ownership from the\n            operation's onset. As seen, this strong level of\n            ownership was a key contributor to the successful\n            implementation of the RRSP; 2) in post-conflict countries\n            such as Liberia with limited capacity, it is particularly\n            important to select a focused number of prior actions that\n            are deemed essential to supporting the government's\n            broader reform program. Such selectivity will not only\n            reduce the transactions costs on a government that is\n            already burdened by multiple management demands, but it will\n            also increase the likelihood that such focused actions are\n            both likely to be enacted and to move the reform program\n            forward. Similarly, the anticipated results of the operation\n            were defined realistically and taking into account the\n            government's implementation capacity; and 3) the\n            effectiveness of Bank supported policy and institutional\n            reform operations can be enhanced by its complementarities\n            with other Bank financed operation and the efforts of other\n            active donors in the reform areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia - Reengagement and Reform Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Liberia - Reengagement and Reform\n

This RRSP supports the full\n            normalization of relations between Liberia and the World\n            Bank and the Government's efforts to establish a\n            rigorous fiscal underpinning for the Liberian economy that\n            will permit accelerated recovery and growth in the context\n            of a multi-donor reengagement process. The proceeds of the\n            grant will be disbursed (i) to support cash flow needs in\n            the period immediately after Liberia has cleared its arrears\n            to IBRD and IDA, and (ii) to meet immediate budgeted fiscal\n            needs including future debt service obligations. The grant\n            would assist the Republic of Liberia in its economic and\n            social recovery underpinned by the government's Interim\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy. This one-tranche operation would\n            support government-owned reforms to improve the\n            country's fiduciary environment and strengthen public\n            institutions.
