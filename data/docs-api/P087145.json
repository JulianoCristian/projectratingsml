Some lessons\n            learned included: it is important to deepen understanding of\n            institutional and governance analysis for countries in\n            transition: the May 2010 election brought about political\n            change in Sri Lanka and with it, critical changes to the\n            design and implementation modalities of the SCDLIP. The\n            preparation process could have benefitted from a better\n            understanding of the implications of institutional and\n            governance systems, and could have incorporated this\n            analysis into the risk assessment and tied it into an\n            effective communication strategy and transition plans.\n            Estate Sector benefitted greatly from infrastructure support\n            but revolving fund system required a different approach.\n            Governance and Social Accountability tools were successfully\n            mainstreamed into project activities enabling devolution of\n            power over local resource management to communities and\n            empowerment to have direct control over resources and\n            decision making.
