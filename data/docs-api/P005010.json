The project will be\n            financed by both the Bank and by a loan of $8.75 million\n            from the OPEC Special Fund (OSF), the latter providing all\n            its funds to SSI projects; SSI financing under the Bank loan\n            is estimated at about 10 percent of the loan proceeds, or\n            about $4 million. At the request of OSF the Bank has agreed\n            to administer the OSF loan. The project does not carry\n            special risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Third Development Finance Company"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Third Development Finance Company"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/02/726979/egypt-third-development-finance-company","projn":"EG-Dfc Iii-268984 -- P005010","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912332973"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"autonomy,bad debt,bad debt\n            provisions,balance of payments,bank branches,Bank\n            loans,banking law,banking sector,basic metals,bonds,capital\n            base,capital goods,capital markets,Central Bank,Central Bank\n            of Egypt,civilian labor force,climate,commercial banks,Cost\n            of Capital,current\n            prices,decentralization,deposits,devaluation,development\n            banking,ECONOMIC IMPACT,economic reform,economies of\n            scale,emigration,employment,equity investments,exchange\n            rate,exports,FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,Financial\n            Performance,financial sector,FISCAL YEAR,food\n            processing,foreign exchange,GDP,gross value,growth\n            potential,growth rate,holding\n            companies,Housing,imports,Industrialization,inflation,inflation\n            rate,insurance,interest rate,Interest rates,intermediate\n            goods,legal framework,Local Government,managers,market\n            value,marketing,metals,migrants,motivation,net\n            value,OPEC,Organization of Petroleum Exporting\n            Countries,price controls,Private Sector,production\n            costs,Productivity,public enterprises,public sector,quality\n            control,real prices,resource allocation,resource\n            mobilization,Retail banking,savings,savings\n            deposits,securities,stock exchanges,taxation,TECHNICAL\n            ASSISTANCE,transport,value added,Vocational\n            Training,wages,workers,working capital,working conditions"},"1":{"cdata!":"autonomy,bad debt,bad debt\n            provisions,balance of payments,bank branches,Bank\n            loans,banking law,banking sector,basic metals,bonds,capital\n            base,capital goods,capital markets,Central Bank,Central Bank\n            of Egypt,civilian labor force,climate,commercial banks,Cost\n            of Capital,current\n            prices,decentralization,deposits,devaluation,development\n            banking,ECONOMIC IMPACT,economic reform,economies of\n            scale,emigration,employment,equity investments,exchange\n            rate,exports,FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,Financial\n            Performance,financial sector,FISCAL YEAR,food\n            processing,foreign exchange,GDP,gross value,growth\n            potential,growth rate,holding\n            companies,Housing,imports,Industrialization,inflation,inflation\n            rate,insurance,interest rate,Interest rates,intermediate\n            goods,legal framework,Local Government,managers,market\n            value,marketing,metals,migrants,motivation,net\n            value,OPEC,Organization of Petroleum Exporting\n            Countries,price controls,Private Sector,production\n            costs,Productivity,public enterprises,public sector,quality\n            control,real prices,resource allocation,resource\n            mobilization,Retail banking,savings,savings\n            deposits,securities,stock exchanges,taxation,TECHNICAL\n            ASSISTANCE,transport,value added,Vocational\n            Training,wages,workers,working capital,working conditions"}},"owner":"Private Sector Dev & Finance Grp (MNSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"1809"},"facets":{}}}
