Some lessons learned included: several\n            outputs of the TSSP depended on progress of outputs to be\n            produced by the Transport Restructuring Project (TRP)-and\n            the TRP depended itself on the outcome of the Programmatic\n            Adjustment Loan (PAL). For example, preparation of an\n            immediate and medium term (5 years) maintenance plan for\n            Romanian National Railway (Infrastructure) Company (CFR)\n            that was to be carried out under the TRP was an essential\n            input for the annual maintenance program of the railways to\n            be financed under the TSSP. This lesson can be divided in\n            three areas: (i) that an additional, important risk is\n            introduced in a project when achieving its objectives\n            depends on the completion of another project's outputs,\n            (ii) that because of such dependency, the Bank-supervision\n            teams and relevant managers-should put especial attention,\n            including raising the issue at higher government levels, on\n            completing the outputs of the companion project-the TRP in\n            this case-and, (iii) if such outputs are not likely to be\n            generated, restructure and amend the project objectives,\n            with a view to delink it from the progress on the companion\n            project. Funding for project implementation, whether\n            counterpart funding or loan disbursement ceilings, is one of\n            the most common project implementation risks. The budget\n            ceilings imposed by the government were one of the critical\n            factors causing the project not to be completed in time.\n            Except in countries that have a solid tradition of providing\n            adequate funding during project implementation, inadequate\n            funding should be presumed to be a substantial risk.\n            Mitigation of this risk is extremely difficult and requires\n            a broad Bank involvement, during preparation as well as\n            during implementation, with the country central economic\n            authorities as well as with the respective sectoral\n            agencies. There were indications early during implementation\n            that for the project to achieve a satisfactory outcome,\n            substantial changes would need to be introduced that\n            required restructuring the project. Aspects that needed to\n            be revised in a restructured project included the target for\n            the road outcome indicator, the expected rail\n            outputs-affected by slow start of implementation and the\n            rail infrastructure damages caused by the floods early\n            during implementation-the budget ceilings, and the\n            non-achievement of important TRP outputs which had an impact\n            on the TSSP. Lessons need to be learned on how to make\n            project restructuring decision in the case of a\n            fast-disbursing project such as TSSP that was envisaged to\n            be implemented in two years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Transport Sector Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Transport Sector\n            Support

          environmental and social safeguard issues in the Municipal\n            Services project, which supports the rehabilitation and\n            improvement of wastewater, storm water and drinking water\n            systems to reduce pollution, improve public health, and\n            assist Romania in meeting environmental requirements for\n            European Union accession, and in the Transport SWAp Project,\n            which provides funds to rehabilitate and improve major road\n            and rail systems. This report concludes that the Romanian\n            system of laws, regulations and practices in the sub-sectors\n            supported by the projects is sufficiently equivalent to\n            those of the World Bank, and sufficiently acceptable in\n            practice, to support piloting under OP/BP 4.00 in four\n            safeguards-related areas. Two of these areas, environmental\n            assessment and cultural property, require very little if any\n            gap-filling. Gap-filling is needed to a greater extent for\n            piloting involuntary resettlement. Should dam safety issues\n            arise in association with the Municipal Services project,\n            the Romanian systems are believed to be also equivalent and\n            acceptable for piloting with very little if any gap-filling.\n            Second, World Bank supervision on safeguard-related matters\n            will continue throughout the projects' implementation\n            to: (1) ensure compliance with \"equivalent and\n            acceptable\" Romanian procedures, (2) assess\n            implementation of gap-filling measures, (3) ensure\n            compliance with Bank policies if/where they apply in lieu of\n            Romanian systems, and (4) looking more broadly, track\n            results in terms of environmental and social development\n            outcomes.
