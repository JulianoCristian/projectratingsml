The project partially achieved its\n            objectives of strengthening the structural base of the\n            forestry sector and increasing the supply of industrial\n            wood, and substantially achieved the objective of\n            stabilizing soil conditions in parts of northern Nigeria.\n            Sustainability is likely; Bank and Borrower performance are\n            rated as generally satisfactory. Key lessons included the\n            following: The Bank and the Borrower need to 1) ensure that\n            a conducive policy environment exists or will be created\n            within an agreed time frame before investing in forestry\n            development; 2) identify and involve all project\n            stakeholders from the planning stage and through the\n            implementation and evaluation stages. A sense of ownership\n            has to be created among the stakeholders to encourage a\n            commitment to implementation and enhance project\n            sustainability; 3) firmly establish from the beginning the\n            collaboration among different agencies involved in the\n            project; and 4) ensure that future projects, particularly\n            for long gestation activities such as afforestation and\n            forestry plantations, are designed as time slices of a long\n            term commitment. This promotes a long-term perspective among\n            the implementers and allows subsequent phases of a project\n            to benefit from the experience of the previous ones."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -

The\n            project's afforestation component would stabilize soil\n            conditions and enhance soil moisture and nutrient content,\n            benefitting agricultural productivity.  The forest\n            management component would improve the management of\n            existing plantations and help establish new plantations,\n            increasing the availability of industrial timber. The\n            support for management, training, policy initiatives,\n            research and studies would greatly strengthen the structural\n            base of the sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Second Forestry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Second Forestry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1986/09/741014/nigeria-second-forestry-project","projn":"NG-Forestry Ii-114116 -- P002089","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Forests and Forestry,Environmental Economics & Policies,Wood Manufacturing and Industry,Forestry,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Environment,Industry,Agriculture,Rural Development","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970701165319"},"subsc":"Forestry","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Industry,Agriculture,Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Afforestation,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural extension,agricultural\n            land,agricultural potential,Agricultural\n            Sector,Agriculture,alternative\n            fuels,clearfelling,Conservator of Forests,country's\n            forest resources,deforestation,degradation,Development\n            Projects,Economic Analysis,economic\n            growth,employment,equipment,erosion,eucalyptus,extension,farm\n            forestry,Farmers,felling,fires,firewood,fodder,Forest,forest\n            activities,forest guards,Forest Management,forest\n            products,forest reserves,forest resources,forest\n            revenue,Forest revenues,forest sector,Forestry,forestry\n            activities,Forestry Department,Forestry Management,forestry\n            models,Forestry Policy,forestry program,forestry\n            programs,Forestry Project,Forestry Research,FORESTRY\n            SECTOR,forestry\n            training,forests,fuelwood,imports,income,interest rates,land\n            acquisition,Land tenure,Livestock,local\n            authorities,logging,logs,marketing,National Forest\n            Policy,National Forestry,oil,overgrazing,packaging,paper\n            products,plantations,planting,plywood,poles,population\n            densities,population\n            pressures,productivity,Pulpwood,regeneration,replacement\n            costs,Rural Development,sawlogs,sawnwood,soil\n            conservation,soil degradation,soil erosion,state\n            forest,state forest management,State\n            Forestry,Teak,timber,tree planting,Trees,Universities,Water\n            Resources,watershed,watershed management,wood,wood\n            production,wood products,wood resources,woodlands"},"1":{"cdata!":"Afforestation,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural extension,agricultural\n            land,agricultural potential,Agricultural\n            Sector,Agriculture,alternative\n            fuels,clearfelling,Conservator of Forests,country's\n            forest resources,deforestation,degradation,Development\n            Projects,Economic Analysis,economic\n            growth,employment,equipment,erosion,eucalyptus,extension,farm\n            forestry,Farmers,felling,fires,firewood,fodder,Forest,forest\n            activities,forest guards,Forest Management,forest\n            products,forest reserves,forest resources,forest\n            revenue,Forest revenues,forest sector,Forestry,forestry\n            activities,Forestry Department,Forestry Management,forestry\n            models,Forestry Policy,forestry program,forestry\n            programs,Forestry Project,Forestry Research,FORESTRY\n            SECTOR,forestry\n            training,forests,fuelwood,imports,income,interest rates,land\n            acquisition,Land tenure,Livestock,local\n            authorities,logging,logs,marketing,National Forest\n            Policy,National Forestry,oil,overgrazing,packaging,paper\n            products,plantations,planting,plywood,poles,population\n            densities,population\n            pressures,productivity,Pulpwood,regeneration,replacement\n            costs,Rural Development,sawlogs,sawnwood,soil\n            conservation,soil degradation,soil erosion,state\n            forest,state forest management,State\n            Forestry,Teak,timber,tree planting,Trees,Universities,Water\n            Resources,watershed,watershed management,wood,wood\n            production,wood products,wood resources,woodlands"}},"owner":"WB Off: Abuja - Western AFR 2 (AFCW2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"5915"},"facets":{}}}
