Some lessons learned includes: the difficulty\n            of introducing modern System Control and Data Acquisition\n            (SCADA)/telecommunications systems should not be\n            underestimated with respect to complexity and time required\n            for implementation. Adequate time should be allowed for\n            development of technical specifications. Project Preparation\n            Facility (PPF) for projects combining investments with\n            sector policy reforms is a critical instrument to provide\n            positive demonstration effects and contribute to increased\n            confidence in success and higher commitment by end\n            beneficiaries. If the institutional framework to ensure the\n            viability of heating investments in the household sector is\n            weak due to ambiguous and often contradictory legal basis of\n            home owner associations, it is better to focus on public\n            buildings, as the social benefits accrue to all. Proper\n            sequencing of policy dialogue and investments provides for\n            better sustainability. Carefully and diligently prioritized\n            investments contribute to positive unintended outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova - Second Energy

This paper seeks your approval to\n            extend the closing date for the project. With the exception\n            of the System Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and\n            telecommunication contract (the largest under the project),\n            all contracts under the electricity component of the project\n            are completed and have contributed to significant\n            improvement of the power transmission network quality\n            indicators. Project completion is behind the implementation\n            schedule, in particular, due to delays in the: (i)\n            implementation of the telecommunication system; (ii) delays\n            in installation of work stations and rectification of relay\n            protection equipment (REF panels) to remove manufacturing\n            defects; and (iii) substation systems installation and\n            testing . The extension is necessary to allow the completion\n            of the final system testing and the operational acceptance\n            under the SCADA and Telecommunication contract.
