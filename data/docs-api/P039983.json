Ratings for the Rural and Small Towns Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project for Ecuador were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was significant, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: sector reform\n            and the related shift in institutional culture require\n            political support and time.  Both Ecuador and Paraguay\n            experienced delays in project effectiveness and\n            implementation due to political instability and social\n            unrest.  Formalization of consistent policies is critical\n            for reform. The comparison of the Water supply and\n            Sanitation (WSS) sectors institutional framework in Ecuador\n            and Paraguay reveals the importance of formalizing sector\n            policies through legal decrees and formal approvals by the\n            congress to ensure that the financial and investment\n            policies are enforced. While they may not be sufficient,\n            formalization of the policies and sector institutional\n            responsibilities seem to be necessary for the implementation\n            of reforms especially as the countries face political\n            changes. In Paraguay, rules for engaging various\n            stakeholders were embedded in laws and decrees. This\n            facilitated the implementation of coherent and consistent\n            financial and investment policies across the sector\n            regardless of who is funding the investments. In Ecuador, on\n            the other hand, the main elements of the institutional and\n            financial policies were not formalized prior to project\n            initiation. Instead, arrangements were agreed on an\n            investment by investment basis. Sanitation requires more\n            attention. Both projects included components to increase\n            coverage of improved sanitation, but the real outcomes\n            achieved through the project activities have been generally\n            poor or difficult to assess due to lack of available data on outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Fourth Rural Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project; Ecuador - Rural and Small Towns

Some lessons learned\n            included: The successful implementation of six pilot water\n            supply systems under the project provides evidence of the\n            viability of private sector financing, construction and\n            operation of rural water supply systems. Participation of\n            local communities throughout the process not only made it\n            more transparent but it also facilitated relations between\n            the private sector and users. Some of the key elements for\n            success include informed involvement of the community\n            throughout the process (including in the determination of\n            tariff and connection costs), the ownership of the systems\n            by the community, and the participation of the government as\n            a broker between the private sector and the community. Pilot\n            projects offer a practical approach to institutional and\n            organizational change in the sector, as they provide\n            opportunities for learning by doing on a small scale while\n            reducing the severity of the consequences of failure. This\n            point is illustrated by the two pilots under the project,\n            which despite different outcomes provided valuable lessons\n            for future projects. Benefiting from these lessons means\n            allocating resources for the required systematic and\n            rigorous analysis and documentation of relevant experiences.\n            Thus, the design of pilots should explicitly address the\n            issue of what hypotheses to test, the methodology to test\n            them, and the methodology to draw the relevant lessons. It\n            should also address the issue of specialized human resources\n            in the Bank required to advise the borrower during pilot\n            preparation and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Fourth Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Paraguay - Fourth Water Supply\n            and Sanitation

  rapid increase of water supply and sanitation coverage in\n            the rural areas. The secondary development objective is to\n            modify the National Environment Sanitation Service's\n            (SENASA) role in the sector from an implementer of projects\n            to an efficiently managed promoter of activities.  The first\n            of four components consists of three subcomponents: 1) New\n            water systems built, basically consisting of a deep well, an\n            elevated tank and a distribution network of primary and/or\n            secondary networks. 2) The production, storage, and\n            distribution systems of ten existing systems will be\n            expanded. 3) New   systems in the department of Chaco will\n            be constructed to supply water to indigenous systems.  The\n            second component consists of two subcomponents: sewage\n            systems -where the communities have grown and there are\n            serious environmental problems from the lack of sanitation-\n            and the construction and distribution of concrete slabs for\n            latrines will be financed. The third component includes the\n            following subcomponents: institutional strengthening of\n            SENASA and newly formed Juntas by financing professional,\n            technical, and community training, and strengthening the\n            environmental management capability of SENASA; designing a\n            pilot program and building incentives for private providers\n            (Aguaterias); promotion of associations of Juntas; and\n            planing a National Rural Water and Sanitation Program.\n            Project component four consists of engineering design for\n            all of the systems; community mobilization and promotion;\n            supervision of the various civil works; and administration\n            and monitoring by SENASA and staff; and analyzing the\n            project's environmental impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Fourth Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Paraguay - Fourth Water
