Some lessons learned included: there should be\n            a champion capable of leading sector reform activities. The\n            Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MOWI) took leadership for\n            the sector reform and continuously followed up on the\n            implementation of this reform. It was also important that\n            Athi Water Services Board (AWSB) and Nairobi City Water and\n            Sewerage Company (NWSC) were championing and piloting the\n            day-to-day implementation of the sector reform, and that\n            both agencies were well suited to do so because of the\n            capacity they already had and which they were constantly\n            increasing throughout the project's implementation\n            period. The project focused its support on one water service\n            board and one water service provider only. By doing so the\n            project avoided overstretching financial resources as well\n            as implementation capacity on the Borrower's and the\n            Bank's side. With the selection of AWSB and NWSC as the\n            agencies for implementing the sector reform first, the\n            project focused on stakeholders which already had some\n            capacity which increased the likelihood of success."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Nairobi Water and Sewerage\n            Institutional Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Nairobi Water and\n            Sewerage Institutional Restructuring Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/08/9838906/kenya-nairobi-water-sewerage-institutional-restructuring-project","projn":"KE-Nairobi Water And Sewerage Institutional\n            Restructuring Project -- P049618","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"m,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Housing & Human Habitats,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Supply and Systems","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20080911001444"},"theme":"Other urban development","subsc":"Water supply","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Assessment of Risk, assessment of risks,\n            asset holding, asset management, audits, BALANCE SHEET, Bank\n            Lending, Baseline Cost, Beneficiaries, Beneficiary, Board\n            members, Borrower, borrowings, bulk water, business plans,\n            calculation, calculations, capacity building, Cash Flow,\n            City Council, civil society, clean water, cleanliness,\n            Collection Efficiency, collection system, consensus\n            building, conserve water, Consumer, consumer information,\n            consumers, contingencies, contribution, covering, creditors,\n            cubic meter, CURRENCY, debt, debtors, delivery of water\n            supply, demand management, Depreciation, Development Bank,\n            early retirement, Earnings, Engineer, environmental issues,\n            Exchange Rate, Financial Analysis, financial management,\n            financial resources, financial sustainability, financial\n            viability, Gender, income, Income Tax, informal settlements,\n            information on customer, infrastructure investments,\n            Insurance, Interest Payments, intervention, interventions,\n            Investing, Investment Program, investment programs,\n            Irrigation, local authorities, local communities, long-term\n            goal, management of water, metering, mobility, National\n            Water Policy, Performance Agreements, Performance\n            Indicators, piped water, Pipeline, pit latrines, pressure,\n            provision of services, provision of water, provision of\n            water supply, public awareness, quality of service, quality\n            of water, quantities of water, quantity of water,\n            questionnaire, questionnaires, regional utilities,\n            responsibilities, retirement benefits, revenue generation,\n            rural areas, rural communities, safety, Salaries,\n            Sanitation, Sanitation Service, sanitation services, Self\n            help, Senior, septic tanks, service delivery, Service\n            demand, Service Improvement, service improvements, Service\n            Provider, Service Provision, Service Quality, settlement,\n            Sewerage Company, Sewerage Corporation, sewerage operations,\n            sewerage service, sewerage services, sewerage system,\n            sewerage systems, Share Capital, slums, Social Protection,\n            Social Services, Spare parts, Stakeholder, stakeholders,\n            successful service delivery, supply of water, sustainable\n            service delivery, timely payment, urban centers, urban\n            development, utilities, valuation, waste disposal,\n            wastewater, Water Conservation, water consumption, water\n            infrastructure, water meters, Water Policy, water quantity,\n            Water Resources, Water Resources Management, water sector,\n            water sector reform, Water Service, water service delivery,\n            Water Service Providers, water service provision, Water\n            Services, Water Supply, water vendors, working capital"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Anglophone (AFTU1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026354-SIDA GRANT TO WSP FOR E. &\n            S.
