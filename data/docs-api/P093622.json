Some lessons learned includes: attempting a\n            radical transformation of agricultural services with the\n            attendant institutional reforms is risky, transaction\n            intensive, requires adequate staff and budget, and requires\n            long-term involvement by the World Bank. Within the\n            framework of an agricultural services project, support to\n            producer organizations is crucial. One key issue in\n            agricultural services projects is the level of funding that\n            beneficiaries should provide. Evaluating the effects of\n            agricultural services projects is a complex and\n            methodologically challenging task."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Second Agricultural Services and\n

      Producer Organizations Project for Senegal is a national\n            agricultural program on rural activities, mainly in the\n            field of agriculture and animal husbandry.  This\n            environmental and social management framework gives an\n            assessment of the environmental and social impacts, both\n            beneficial and adverse that the project may entail, when\n            implemented in whatever agro ecological area that may be\n            concerned. Expected negative impacts associated with\n            subprojects include: misuse of chemical pesticides and water\n            pollution in the irrigation system; loss of pasturage for\n            livestock and land degradation arising from overuse;\n            clogging of the drainage system from stored materials, and\n            interference with natural habitats if not ecosystem\n            destruction; flooding; disease spread because of stagnant\n            waters (including malaria and bilharzia) water contamination\n            leading to dysentery and other diseases due to non-use of\n            latrines and other unhygienic practices; conflicts over\n            water usage; noise during blasting; erosion; soil\n            salinization; the reduction of land able to be cultivated;\n            lack of veterinary medicines; over-exploitation of forests;\n            risk of contamination from pharmaceuticals improperly stored\n            within households; environmental pollution from wastewater\n            and solid waste from livestock; risk of marginalization of\n            small producers due to market segmentation, the rise in the\n            meat prices, infrastructure modernization and their\n            maintenance costs, and unemployment of informal sector\n            workers; loss of vegetal cover and increased erosion;\n            lowering of the water table; and contamination due to\n            pesticide use; air pollution and noxious odors;\n            contamination of food products; and risk of fire, among\n            other impacts. Mitigation measures may include: the rational\n            use of pesticides, reserving spaces for foraging, restoring\n            soil fertility, training farmers and farmer organizations to\n            maintain flood works and in animal hygiene and veterinary\n            techniques; latrine construction; conflict resolution used\n            to control water usage; building of troughs and wells;\n            installing of pumps far from residences; building irrigation\n            canals for the dry season; replacing excavated material;\n            providing compensation to displaced persons; using drainage\n            works; replanting trees; integrated management of water\n            resources; avoiding prolonged food storage; ensuring that\n            imported animals are disease-free (have a certificate of\n            health); encouraging traditional/local pastoral\n            practices/indigenous knowledge and technical innovation, and\n            improving traditional infrastructure; restoring the vegetal\n            cover; establishing a waste management plan; promoting the\n            use of organic fertilizer (manure); making selective site\n            choices; wearing protective gear to avoid pesticide\n            poisoning; avoiding the introduction of exotic species even\n            if the risk is low; treating wastewater according to\n            international norms; and raising sensitivity of sexually\n            transmitted diseases among workers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Actualisation du cadre de gestion\n            environnementale
