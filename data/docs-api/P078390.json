Two main lessons are\n            highlighted as follows. First, Serbia's Government had\n            set an ambitious reform agenda, and the Ministry of Finance\n            provided strong reform leadership across the social\n            protection and health agenda. Specifically, Serbia's\n            Ministry of Social Affairs was the main driver of reforms,\n            both in pensions and social welfare, and child protection,\n            and this is where the reform outcomes have been most\n            impressive. This clearly demonstrates that policy\n            development lending achieves most impressive outcomes in\n            situations where the Bank flexibly responds to a strong\n            reform-minded Government. It also shows the difference in\n            results and impact between cases where a counterpart is\n            actively shaping the process, and setting the agenda for\n            technical assistance and its follow-up, and those where\n            counterparts are not in the driver's seat, but wait for\n            the Bank's push. Second, with part of the task team\n            based in Europe at the time of preparation, the Bank was\n            able to effectively support the Government in the pursuit of\n            its ambitious reform agenda in the areas of pension, health\n            and social welfare reforms. This extended staff in-country\n            presence, and extensive and flexible availability of a\n            stable core team, helped the Bank in effectively responding\n            to Government requests for support, in a period of ambitious reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia and Montenegro - Social Sector\n            Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Serbia and
