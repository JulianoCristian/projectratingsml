The project had the following objectives: (i)\n            increasing the production of low-income housing; (ii)\n            adoption by Ecuadorian Housing Bank (BEV) of interest rate\n            policies and a new mortgage instrument designed to improve\n            resource mobilization and allocation in the housing sector;\n            (iii) further streamlining and strengthening of the\n            financial, administrative and productive efficiency of BEV/\n            National Housing Board (JNV) within a continued process of\n            rationalization of the Government's public housing\n            investment program; (iv) better targeting of BEV/JNV\n            production to make it more responsive to the needs of\n            low-income beneficiaries; and (v) fostering greater\n            participation of private contractors/developers in the\n            production of low-income housing. The results show that\n            while the physical goals were surpassed, the institutional\n            goals and more far-reaching efforts to establish an entity\n            with a largely self-sustaining system were not very\n            successful. Overall, the Borrower remained in compliance\n            with loan covenants. The following are some of the key\n            lessons learned from this project: 1) Use of a specialized\n            public-sector entity such as BEV to capture funds in the\n            market for long-term mortgage lending on a largely\n            commercial basis and for low-income groups is not feasible;\n            2) Trying to satisfy housing sector demand for low-income\n            groups through public-sector housing construction programs\n            is not sustainable; 3) To reach lower-income groups and\n            encourage greater activity in the sector, a greater emphasis\n            on demand analysis and the lowering of norms and standards\n            is required."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Second National Low-Income Housing
