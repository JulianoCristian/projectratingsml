Some lessons\n            learned included: Business administration and management\n            skills throughout the Patrimony of Protected Areas will\n            increase the ability to deal with pressures on protected\n            areas by extractive industries and other activities and to\n            increase the protected areas' economic and financial\n            potential. Since the initial operation of the global\n            environmental facility (GEF), biodiversity projects have\n            tried to demonstrate the important link between biodiversity\n            conservation and economic development, including improved\n            livelihoods and cost-effectiveness to mainstream\n            conservation in national development planning and economic\n            policies. Effort should continue to actually demonstrate\n            such a linkage through real, replicable initiatives\n            involving populations whose livelihoods mainly and directly\n            depend on the sustainable use of natural resources. The\n            protected areas management plans should become tools not\n            only for planning, but to actually increase overall\n            management efficiency. These plans should permit the\n            establishment of a structure synchronizing actions made\n            within the central ministry of environment (MAE) and within\n            the distinct regions of MAE with the end goal of ensuring an\n            efficient administration of the protected areas. A wider\n            dissemination of the knowledge accumulated though such\n            planning exercises will also help to ensure long-term\n            commitment by key actors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador -

This project is the first phase of a four-year\n            project. There are four project components. Component 1 aims\n            to consolidate the role of the Directorate of Biodiversity\n            and Protected Areas (DBPA) as the agency responsible for\n            administering the National System of Protected Areas (NSPA).\n            It will develop the regulatory framework to promote\n            participatory management and co-management of PAs in the\n            country.Sub-components include: 1) updating the NSPA\n            strategic plan to coordinate DBAP long-term actions; 2)\n            preparing a financial and managerial system for DBAP and\n            implementing it in nine protected areas; 3) developing a\n            sustainable financial strategy; 4) implementing pilot\n            concessions of services; 5) designing and implementing a\n            training program; 6) strengthening mechanisms for\n            institutional coordination, participation, technical advice,\n            and political support by civil society to manage and\n            consolidate the NSPA; and 7) developing legal instruments.\n            Component 2 promotes participatory management by developing\n            participatory models according to the specific social and\n            political conditions of each area. Component 3 is directed\n            to achieve the consolidation of the Protected Areas Fund\n            (FAP) that operates within the National Environmental Fund\n            of Ecuador.
