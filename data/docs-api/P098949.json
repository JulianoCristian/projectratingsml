Second Village Investment Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Second Village Investment Project\n            for the Kyrgyz Republic received a satisfactory outcome\n            rating with moderate risk to development outcome. The Bank\n            received a moderately satisfactory performance rating for\n            their role in the project while the Borrower\u2019s performance\n            was rated as satisfactory. Three restructuring took place\n            during the life of this project. The first restructuring:\n            (i) triggered Operational Policy (OP) 4.12 on involuntary\n            resettlement; (ii) clarified that the only PDO was the one\n            in the financing agreement and not as slightly differently\n            formulated in the project appraisal document; (iii) included\n            a new results indicator to capture increased employment in\n            beneficiary communities; (iv) adopted a set of new\n            International Development Agency (IDA) core sector\n            indicators to help capture results; and (v) extended the\n            closing date for the project and the additional financing by\n            six. The second restructuring (i) extended the closing date\n            and additional financing by one year; and (ii) reallocated\n            SDR 35,000 from category \"Unallocated\" to\n            \"Goods, Works, Training, and Operating Costs\". The\n            third restructuring extended the closing date by 22 months.\n            The additional financing was approved to (i) finance the\n            costs associated with an unanticipated financing gap\n            resulting from a cost overrun in the completion of village\n            investment micro-projects and (ii) retrofit a small number\n            of deficient structures constructed through micro-projects.\n            The second additional financing was used to fund the\n            technical design and retrofitting of additional 18\n            structures that could not be funded by the first additional\n            financing. Several lessons are recorded from this project\n            including the following: (1) the success of Village\n            Investment Project (VIP2) was attributable to a number of\n            good practices and measures that can be highlighted as\n            valuable lessons for other community driven development\n            (CDD) and local government projects, (2) a three-tiered\n            quality assurance mechanism was essential to improving the\n            quality of civil works, (3) repeating the micro-project\n            investment cycles helped gain trust, capacity, and\n            participation of community members, (4) evenly targeting all\n            rural communities with small micro-projects, instead of\n            focusing on selected poor communities, was an appropriate\n            approach to gaining the confidence of the population, (5)\n            the participatory selection process of micro-projects helped\n            to increase the sustainability of small scale enterprises\n            supported by VIP2, (6) establishing solid communication\n            channels was key to mobilizing villagers, facilitating\n            social inclusion, and increasing transparency, and (7)\n            village profiles and group-specific statements of needs and\n            priorities facilitated the inclusion of different social\n            groups in VIP2\u2019s micro-project activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Second Village Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic - Second Village\n
