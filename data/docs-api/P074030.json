Some\n            lessons learned included: the low quality of the final\n            engineering design and procurement documents that were\n            certified to be ready at approval for the first year's\n            activities of the project and that did not address\n            adequately the technical approach of road improvement\n            envisaged by the project, has led to important delays for\n            the project implementation. It would be appropriate to\n            ensure technical design studies and bidding documents\n            completely validated and approved before declaring them\n            ready when considering the project first year's\n            investment program. The introduction of the spot improvement\n            concept in rehabilitation works on roads with low traffic\n            requires careful preparation/advocacy/planning so it can\n            work locally. The tendency of road administrations,\n            contractors and consultants is to fully rehabilitate the\n            concerned roads. For TSP, technical studies did not\n            appropriately take this concept into account while designing\n            the needed works, and bids came in higher than expected.\n            Contractors misunderstood the concept introduced by the\n            project of road spot improvements at the start of the\n            project. This means that without full ownership of the spot\n            improvement rehabilitation concept and capacity to implement\n            it, it should not be attempted or should be redefined as a\n            classical bridges/culvert/drainage works\n            rehabilitation/construction approach. High Intensity\n            Labor-based Method (HILM) approach for small scale roads\n            should be promoted as a way to provide job opportunities for\n            local populations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Transport Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Transport Sector

It reports that the most affected\n            environmental and social aspects are: air quality due to\n            dust dispersion and atmospheric releases; water supply,\n            which could result in restricting availability; soils\n            affected by erosion and compacting, which lead to land loss;\n            degradation and fragmentation of animal habitat; protected\n            areas where work is carried out without supervision;\n            population directly affected by work which is not\n            compensated on time; women, who are generally excluded from\n            the consultation and compensation processes, although they\n            are affected by the works; a decreased standard of living\n            due to disruption of lifestyle or of economic activities;\n            and health risks to population because of accidents,\n            sexually transmitted diseases, and respiratory diseases.\n            Mitigation measures are of two types: those requiring minor\n            adjustments to current methods or practices, and those\n            requiring in-depth changes in the processes. Measures in the\n            first category include: identifying protected areas,\n            deciding areas for heavy machinery transport, scheduling\n            work, determining water supply potential, managing toxic\n            materials and potential contaminants, and equally employing\n            women and men. Measures requiring substantial changes\n            include: ensuring work area safety, training workers about\n            safety, developing better information and consultative\n            processes, protecting rivers, rehabilitating construction\n            sites once work has finished, and reducing pollutants\n            (noise, dust, and landscape)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Fiche des prescriptions environnementales et\n            social des travaux d'amenagement de dix sept (17)\n            ouvrages d'art dans les six regions du Burkina Faso"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Transport Sectoral\n            Project : social and environmental assessment (Vol. 6) :\n            Fiche des prescriptions environnementales et social des\n            travaux d'amenagement de dix sept (17) ouvrages\n            d'art dans les six regions du Burkina Faso"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/02/15643724/burkina-faso-transport-sectoral-project-social-environmental-assessment-vol-6-fiche-des-prescriptions-environnementales-social-des-travaux-damenagement-de-dix-sept-17-ouvrages-dart-dans-les-six-regions-du-burkina-faso","projn":"BF-Transport Sector Project-579873 -- P074030","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Municipal Financial Management,Roads & Highways,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Urban Development","count":"Burkina Faso","authors":{"authr":"Tecsult International Limitee, Quebec, Canada"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20120119005746"},"subsc":"General transportation sector,Roads and highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Urban Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Air quality management;
