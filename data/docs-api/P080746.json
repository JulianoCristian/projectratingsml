The multi-sectoral preparation team was\n            highly experienced in technical issues and operational\n            procedures, and the operation successfully built on the\n            Bank's substantial experience in the health, education\n            and social protection sectors, accumulated through lending,\n            and sector work, whereas the commitment of both the\n            outgoing, and incoming administrations, to human\n            development, ensuring the continuity of successful social\n            programs, was instrumental in the smooth process of design,\n            and implementation. This simplified Implementation\n            Completion Report (ICR) provides the following major factors\n            affecting both implementation, and outcome. The choice of\n            instrument, programmatic adjustment lending, was highly\n            relevant, reflecting an appropriate mix of actions, oriented\n            to achieving short-term macroeconomic and sectoral impacts,\n            as well as those aimed at sustaining the sectors'\n            long-term development goals. Furthermore, it ensured partial\n            financing of the nominal fiscal deficit, and the external\n            financial requirements of the public sector, while\n            protecting sound social programs. The complementarity with\n            other multi-lateral organizations, i.e., the assistance\n            provided by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to\n            Brazil in the social sectors, consistent with the ongoing\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF) standby arrangement,\n            supported enhancements to four successful cash transfer\n            programs (Bolsa Alimenta\ufffd\ufffdo, Bolsa Escola, Agente Jovem, and\n            Programa de Erradica\ufffd\ufffdo do Trabalho Infantil), ensuring the\n            protection of vulnerable groups, under a tight fiscal\n            environment, and the continuation of successful social\n            programs, while promoting greater efficiency in those\n            programs. Findings and implications for subsequent\n            Programmatic Human Development Sector Reform Loan (PSRL)\n            stages address: the improved efficiency in the use of public\n            resources in the social sectors, suggesting the Technical\n            Assistance Loan, currently under preparation, remains of\n            foremost importance to the subsequent phases of this\n            operation; the promotion of further alignment with state,\n            and municipal policies, and close monitoring at all levels\n            is strongly advised; continued benefiting from seasoned\n            multi-sector preparation, and supervision team who selected\n            the set of social programs, fully functional, and with a\n            solid track record; and, the successful integration of\n            activities, and reform programs for education, heath, and\n            social protection along cross-cutting programmatic and\n            reform themes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - First Programmatic Human\n            Development Sector Reform Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - First Programmatic Human\n            Development Sector Reform Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4840963/brazil-first-programmatic-human-development-sector-reform-loan-project","projn":"BR-Hd Prgm.
