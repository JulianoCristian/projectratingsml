Some\n            lessons learned included: the Bank should not expect too\n            much from consultations with stakeholders in a country\n            tightly controlled by the security apparatus. In the\n            interviews carried out for the preparation of the completion\n            report, most interlocutors complained that there had been\n            too little consultation in the development of the reform\n            program. In a society undermined by deep corruption and\n            cronyism, statements from the ruling elite should not be\n            taken at face value. In his electoral program for 2009-2014,\n            President Ben Ali made employment a national priority. He\n            promised reforms to address the unemployment and social\n            protection challenges. While he made his speeches, he was\n            strengthening the rent seeking system which was stifling\n            entrepreneurship and job creation. The previous regime,\n            which seemed to be well entrenched, was swept away in a\n            short period of time. Solid political economy analyses are\n            essential to better understand the constraints and\n            frustrations in a country where opportunities are scant\n            because of deeply embedded corruption."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Employment Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Employment Development\n            Policy Loan Project  :

Achieving a lower unemployment rate will require\n            demand side interventions, including private sector\n            development, increased competitiveness, and innovation;\n            supply side interventions, including education and\n            vocational training systems; and effective labor market\n            intermediation to match demand and supply.

The\n            identified policy matrix covers: (i) short-term measures\n            supported by this first DPL (DPL I), to be realized by May\n            2010, (ii) potential medium-term measures, to be realized in\n            a second DPL (DPL II) by mid 2011, and (iii) a shared vision\n            of achievements, to be realized by the end of this 5-year\n            program. It also contains performance indicators to be\n            achieved by May 2012 (one year after the end of DPL II)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisie - Un pret de politique de\n            developpement de
