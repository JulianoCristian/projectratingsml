Some lessons learned included: in\n            natural disaster-afflicted areas, it is important to build\n            for quality even if it requires that fewer schools be built.\n            Although Haiti suffered from devastating natural disasters\n            and fundamentally agreed on the need for greater safety in\n            schools, it has still proven difficult to develop a\n            comprehensive National Action Plan for Safer Schools. This\n            difficulty can be traced to the fact that ownership and\n            commitment from MENFP (Ministere de L'Education\n            Nationale et de la Formation Professionelle - Ministry of\n            Education) was lacking from the beginning. Although\n            implementing agencies had the capacity to build and\n            supervise the building of schools, there needed to be a\n            closer review of designs for schools. The Bank could make\n            greater use of its skills and resources in reviewing and\n            improving local designs. The MENFP did not maximize the\n            opportunity for the demonstration effect of the construction\n            of new schools. In particular, it was not clear to other\n            stakeholders whether the Project was presenting a new model\n            for construction of schools that would be financed by other\n            donors, or whether the new schools were simply a\n            demonstration of what could be built with local capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti -

However, the PURES activities could have social\n            negative impacts and require the application of\n            environmental and social protection operational\n            instructions. That is why the wording of this project\n            provided for the development of a Resettlement Policy\n            Framework (RPF) which is the purpose of this study. The\n            Resettlement Policy Framework describes the objectives,\n            principles and procedures which frame the means of obtaining\n            the lands for infrastructures utilities setting up. The RPF\n            clarifies the rules that are applicable to the\n            identification of the people who are likely to be involved\n            in the PURES activities implementation. There are no long\n            term impacts anticipated with the construction or\n            rehabilitation of schools. As the sites are already\n            identified, the risks to destroy buildings and houses are\n            practically nonexistent. Nevertheless, on the bare fields,\n            certain activities could have moderate or social negative\n            minor impacts, notably on the agrarian lands (destruction of\n            culture fields)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cadre de politique de reinstallation"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ha\u00efti - Projet d\u2019urgence de\n            reconstruction des \u00e9tablissements scolaires\u00a0: plan abr\u00e9g\u00e9 de\n            r\u00e9installation : Cadre de politique de r\u00e9installation"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/08/13188502/haiti-emergency-school-reconstruction-project-abbreviated-resettlement-plan-cadre-de-politique-de-reinstallation","projn":"HT-Emergency School Reconstruction Project\n            -- P115261","subtopic":"Information Security & Privacy,Environmental Economics & Policies,Housing & Human Habitats,Education For All,Population Policies","docty":"Resettlement Plan","teratopic":"Environment,Education,Information and Communication Technologies,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Haiti","authors":{"authr":"Ndiaye, Omar Karamoko"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20101202143346"},"subsc":"Other social services,Public administration- Education,Primary education","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Environment,Education,Information and Communication Technologies,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"arrangements, basic education, capacity\n            building, classroom, classrooms, communities, Description,\n            descriptions, disclosure, documents, educational\n            infrastructure, Emergencies, entry, Environmental,\n            environmental impacts, environmental management,\n            environmental risk, Habitats, hardware, Indigenous Peoples,\n            institutional capacity, National Action, National Action\n            Plan, natural disasters, Policy Framework, Primary\n            education, primary school, public primary schools,\n            rehabilitation of schools, Resettlement, respect, safety,\n            sanitation, school buildings, school construction, school\n            facilities, School Reconstruction, school sites, Secondary\n            education, site, social benefits, Social Development, social\n            infrastructure, student population, teacher, teachers,\n            temporary shelters, vulnerability"}},"owner":"Education Sector (LCSHE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"repnb":"RP1025","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Programme d\u0092Urgence de\n            Reconstruction des Etablissements Scolaires (PURES) : cadre\n            de politique de reinstallation<BR>"}}},"facets":{}}}
