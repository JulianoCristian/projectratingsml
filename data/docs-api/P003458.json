The\n            project's principal objective was to assist the\n            Government of the People's Republic of China (GOC) to\n            relieve congestion in the port of Tianjin and increase\n            handling capacity by providing additional facilities and\n            improving the planning, managerial and operational\n            capabilities of its staff. The objective of decentralizing\n            the port authority so it could operate as a financially\n            autonomous corporation was only partly achieved, since the\n            function of setting tariffs is still under Government\n            control. The project should be sustainable. The main\n            findings from the project's implementation was that\n            Tianjin Port Authority (TPA) and Tianjin Harbor Construction\n            and Development Company (THCDC) were quite capable of\n            handling the construction and procurement of equipment. A\n            key lesson was that the project's flexible design for\n            the wharf, which allowed it to be converted to a container\n            terminal, was a major factor in its success. Another lesson\n            was that procurement of goods took longer than expected\n            because of the dual evaluation process carried out. A third\n            lesson was that financial targets with respect to\n            decentralizing the setting of tariffs, should have been\n            identified more precisely in the SAR."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
