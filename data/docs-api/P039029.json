The qualitative data reveal\n            that the social fund process is elite-driven and decision\n            making tends to be dominated by a small group of motivated\n            individuals. However, by the end of the project there is\n            broad based satisfaction with the outcome. The quantitative\n            data from 500 households mirror these findings by showing\n            that ex-ante the social fund does not address the expressed\n            needs of the majority of individuals in the majority of\n            communities. By the end of the construction process,\n            however, 80 per cent of the community expresses satisfaction\n            with the outcome. An analysis of the determinants of\n            participation demonstrates that better educated and better\n            networked individuals dominate the process. Propensity score\n            analysis reveals that JSIF has had a causal impact on\n            improvements in trust and the capacity for collective\n            action, but these gains are greater for elites within the\n            community. Both JSIF and non-JSIF communities are more\n            likely now to make decisions that affect their lives which\n            is indicative of a broad based effort to promote\n            participatory development in the country, but JSIF\n            communities do not show higher levels of community driven\n            decisions than non-JSIF communities. The evidence in this\n            paper sheds light on the complex ways in which community\n            driven development works inside communities, a process that\n            is deeply imbedded within Jamaica\u0092s socio-cultural and\n            political context."},"docna":{"cdata!":"The social impact of social funds in Jamaica\n            : a mixed-methods analysis of participation, targeting and\n            collective action in community driven development"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"The social impact of social funds\n            in Jamaica : a mixed-methods analysis of participation,\n            targeting and collective action in community driven development"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/12/23946795/social-impact-social-funds-jamaica-mixed-methods-analysis-participation-targeting-collective-action-community-driven-development","count":"Jamaica","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to jobs, anthropologists, authority,\n            beneficiary assessments, Church, citizens, clinics,\n            Collective Action, communities, community activities,\n            community associations, community based organizations,\n            community centers, community consultation, community\n            decision making, Community Development, Community Driven\n            Development, community groups, community involvement,\n            community leaders, community learning, community life,\n            community meetings, community members, community\n            organizations, community participation, community\n            structures, community support, conflict, consultation,\n            crime, cultural life, development policies, economic\n            development, engineers, families, family structure, female,\n            female headed households, field visits, full participation,\n            gender, households, housing, human capital, intervention,\n            interventions, jobs, key actors, leadership, living\n            standards, movement, neighborhood, neighborhoods, parents,\n            participatory development, participatory process,\n            plantations, political patronage, public education, regional\n            differences, rehabilitation, rural community, rural\n            development, schools, self-help, settlement, slum, social\n            analysis, social capital, social cohesion, Social Funds,\n            social life, social problems, Social Protection, social\n            scientists, social structure, socialization, Society,\n            Teenagers, transportation, violence, writings, youth, youth unemployment"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","topic":"Education Finance m1327514 498,Social Cohesion m1327189 738,Education for All m1327049 1467,Education Districts m1327034 2141,Education m1327048 470","projn":"JM-Soc.

More specifically, the\n            Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) is designed to assist\n            the government in responding to the needs of the most\n            vulnerable groups currently underserved by existing programs\n            and institutional mechanisms by: (a) establishing an\n            efficient, demand-driven and complementary mechanism to\n            deliver basic services and infrastructure to the poor; (b)\n            mobilizing and channeling additional resources to the areas\n            of basic social and economic infrastructure and social\n            services; and (c) increasing national institutional capacity\n            to identify, design, implement, manage and sustain\n            small-scale community-based projects. The project consists\n            of two components.
