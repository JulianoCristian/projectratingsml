Some lessons\n            learned included: the strong focus of the Government on\n            outcomes was vital in driving implementation of the reform\n            agenda. The authorities were sharply focused on achieving\n            specific development outcomes and the Development Policy\n            Operations (DPO) team supported the authorities in\n            developing a detailed set of monitorable outcome indicators\n            to track results from implementation of the reform program.\n            The focus on results and outcomes not only helped track\n            implementation, but also helped to more sharply define and\n            formulate the reform triggers necessary for achievement of\n            the desired results. The set of monitorable indicators went\n            beyond specifying end-program status and value targets by\n            specifying intermediate target values for each operation.\n            This helped track the pace of achievement of results along\n            the course of the programmatic series. The programmatic\n            approach afforded important flexibility to advance and\n            deepen reform implementation in several areas and reduce the\n            scope of or provide additional time for implementation in\n            other areas. This approach allowed the program to maintain\n            its relevance to country circumstances, reinforced\n            government ownership, and contributed to a strong\n            relationship of trust between the Bank and the Government.\n            The flexibility was particularly appropriate in light of the\n            Government's sharp focus on achieving results, which\n            allowed the Bank to be flexible in supporting the path\n            followed in arriving at the desired results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - First, Second, and Third\n            Development Policy

social safety net, and\n            competitiveness in Georgia. In 2008\u201309, Georgia was hit with\n            the dual shocks of the August 2008 conflict with Russia and\n            the global financial crisis. The authorities were faced with\n            the dual challenges of mitigating the impact of the economic\n            downturn in the short term, and facilitating recovery and\n            preparing Georgia for post-crisis growth in the medium term.\n            The Development Policy Operations (DPO) series was formed by\n            World Bank which supported a macroeconomic and fiscal\n            framework to restore confidence and mitigate the downturn in\n            2009, followed by quality fiscal adjustment to safeguard\n            sustainability as economic recovery took hold in 2010\u201311.\n            The social safety net was strengthened to support poor and\n            vulnerable segments of the population during difficult\n            economic times. The DPO -supported reforms provided\n            financial and medical aid to thousands of poor and\n            vulnerable Georgians while the economy regained its footing.\n            Around 440,000 people received targeted social assistance in\n            2011 and roughly 900,000 people received targeted medical\n            insurance. The reforms have also bolstered investor\n            confidence and improved competitiveness by reducing business\n            costs and making it faster and easier to move goods in and\n            out of Georgia."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Strengthening public finances, the\n            social safety net, and competitiveness"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Georgia - Strengthening
