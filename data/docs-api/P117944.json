Some lessons learned included: Experience\n            points to the need for adopting a simple approach in most\n            fragile countries, in particular in a country with high risk\n            of occurrence of major natural disasters as Haiti. The\n            decision to do a single-tranche operation was adequate in\n            view of the possible risks affecting the operation, the\n            period required by the Government to implement the reforms,\n            and the need to test the Government's sustained\n            commitment to the reform program. However, in a country with\n            an extremely low capacity, there is the need for future\n            projects of this kind to specify better the responsibility\n            of every agency in achieving the stated objectives.  A key\n            immediate challenge for the government was to continue\n            strengthening the legal framework for public finance\n            management and public procurement to ensure proper\n            management of aid inflows. Public expenditure management and\n            procurement are of great importance as aid inflows are\n            expected for reconstruction programs. This is a lesson drawn\n            from experience in post-natural disaster countries. Close\n            coordination among development partners within a simple,\n            commonly agreed reform\u2019s framework is important. Such an\n            approach requires a prioritization of reforms with a\n            reasonable milestone framework based on commonly agreed targets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Third Economic Governance Reform Operation"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Haiti - Third Economic Governance\n            Reform Operation"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/05/18265451/haiti-third-economic-governance-reform-operation","projn":"HT-3rd Econ.

The single-tranche operation is\n            expected to be followed by a fourth EGRO within the context\n            of a programmatic series. The series of operations will\n            support policies and reforms aimed at: (i) creating fiscal\n            space for priority expenditures by reducing inefficiencies\n            in the electricity sector; (ii) improving public finance\n            management by prioritizing allocations to key sectors in\n            poverty reduction and growth, and improving information\n            system to enhance revenue mobilization capacity; and (iii)\n            strengthening the framework for public procurement. The\n            operation was designed in the context of improved donor\n            harmonization on budget support agreed with the Government\n            in April 2009. The success of EGRO III faces substantial\n            economic, political, natural disaster, and institutional\n            capacity risks. These risks reflect: (i) possible further\n            impact of the global economic slowdown; (ii) the\n            country's exposure to external shocks, including food\n            and oil price rises and natural disasters; (iii) a potential\n            weakening of support for key policy actions together with a\n            weakening of political stability in the context of\n            legislative elections set for 2010; and (iv) weak capacity\n            to implement and oversee reforms. Mitigating factors include\n            the Government's commitment to reforms through\n            satisfactory implementation of the predecessor operations\n            since 2006, fulfillment of the prior actions, and focus on\n            follow-on measures targeting critical areas of economic\n            management and governance as part of a medium-term vision,\n            which have started generating positive results in a limited\n            but important number of reform areas. Lastly, donors'\n            projects in the areas targeted by the operation will help\n            mitigate institutional capacity risk."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Third Economic Governance Reform\n            Operation Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Haiti - Third Economic Governance\n            Reform Operation Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/11/11370405/haiti-third-economic-governance-reform-operation-program","projn":"HT-3rd Econ.
