Several lessons are drawn form the\n            experience of the project. Most importantly, future Bank\n            assistance should focus more on improving the institutional\n            framework and governance structure within which the road\n            transport sector is managed and financed. Because road\n            transport investment is the largest capital expenditure in\n            the country, governance issues in the sector take on added\n            importance. The poor governance structure, high transaction\n            costs, and protracted delays during procurement and\n            implementation of works all contribute to the high overall\n            cost of road construction in Bangladesh, one of the most\n            expensive in the region. Governance problems also affect the\n            planning and budgeting of road investment, as well as the\n            performance of sector staff. Supporting procurement reform,\n            and improving competitive contracting procedures for\n            maintenance are likely to increase the transparency of road\n            works procurement. Other reforms aimed at instituting a\n            transparent planning and budget allocation process, and at\n            commercializing or privatizing the Road and Highways\n            Department (RHD)'s non-core activities, will also help\n            improve the overall governance environment in the road\n            sector. It is further suggested that successful\n            implementation of institutional and policy reforms in the\n            road transport sector requires more than capacity building.\n            It also requires strong and sustained commitment for reforms\n            by senior policy makers of the government; full coordination\n            and reinforcement from key donors; use of consultants with\n            local knowledge to assist with the implementation of complex\n            reforms; meaningful consultation with the public; clear\n            defined objectives or outcomes of the reforms, effective\n            project incentives, leverage and/or associated credit\n            conditionality; and, adequate supervision, monitoring, and\n            evaluation. It is highlighted that consultants acted only as\n            the \"Engineer's representative\" while RHD was\n            both the \"Employer\" and the \"Engineer.\"\n            This practice severely undermined the independence of the\n            \"Engineer\" which is the cornerstone of the\n            International Federation of Consulting Engineers'\n            (FIDIC) procedures, and, also affected the transparency of\n            contract administration. In fact, by restricting\n            international consultants from exercising their independent\n            rights, the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) is not fully\n            utilizing the consultants' services, in spite of paying\n            high fees for their services. For new projects in the\n            transport sector, Consultants should perform the role of\n            \"Engineer\" with all obligations including quality\n            and certification. Other lessons address the importance of\n            parallel reforms in GoB public administration; and, that\n            RHD's public procurement processes need significant\n            improvement to ensure transparency and accountability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -

reduce the total cost of road\n            transport on Bangladesh's most traveled roads. The\n            project will consist of construction of the Nalka-Bonpara\n            road, rehabilitation and improvement of the Dhaka-Sylhet\n            road, and construction of several small but important\n            bridges. During construction phase, soils and general waste\n            matters will be handled and deposited safely. The project\n            will create large waterbodies as a result of excavation of\n            sand borrowpits. These borrowpits will become permanent\n            lakes due to their depth and dimension. The lakes will be\n            rehabilitated after construction. Few dozens of clay\n            borrowpits will be created due to excavation for the\n            cladding of the slopes. The topsoil from the clearing and\n            grubbing will be used for this cladding. Air pollution will\n            be controlled by collecting dust with cloth filters, or\n            spraying water at construction sites. Transport equipment\n            will be furnished with silent boxes to reduce noise. The\n            road design includes large-scale plantation of the\n            embankment with trees and bushes, which will reduce the\n            lateral transmission of noise during operation. To mitigate\n            the risk of floods, culverts are required to be provided for\n            proper drainage. In places where erosion is to be expected,\n            wind grasses will be planted."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Third Road Rehabilitation and\n            Maintenance Project : environmental impact assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Third Road\n            Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project : environmental\n            impact assessment (Vol. 7)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/12/438980/bangladesh-third-road-rehabilitation-maintenance-project-environmental-impact-assessment-vol-7","projn":"BD-Third Road Rehabilitation &\n            Maintenance -- P037294","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Voluntary and Involuntary Resettlement,Housing & Human Habitats,Human Migrations & Resettlements,Urban Housing","teratopic":"Environment,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Social Development","count":"Bangladesh","authors":{"authr":"Engineering Science, Ltd."},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00011506050853"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Central government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Social Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Administrative procedures,Air\n            Pollution,communities,community\n            development,Compensation,compensation\n            criteria,Construction,cost effectiveness,displaced\n            persons,displacement,districts,drinking water,economic\n            development,employment,Environmental Management,Evaluation\n            Criteria,fish,habitat,households,human\n            settlements,impoverishment,Income,involuntary\n            resettlement,land acquisition,land compensation,Land\n            market,population growth,poverty alleviation,Project\n            Affected Persons,project areas,RAP,RESETTLEMENT,resettlement\n            activities,resettlement planning,Resettlement\n            policy,Resettlement programs,resettlement sites,resettlement\n            strategies,resettlers,rural\n            areas,savings,squatters,temporary\n            resettlement,traffic,villages,vulnerable groups"},"1":{"cdata!":"Administrative procedures,Air\n            Pollution,communities,community\n            development,Compensation,compensation\n            criteria,Construction,cost effectiveness,displaced\n            persons,displacement,districts,drinking water,economic\n            development,employment,Environmental Management,Evaluation\n            Criteria,fish,habitat,households,human\n            settlements,impoverishment,Income,involuntary\n            resettlement,land acquisition,land compensation,Land\n            market,population growth,poverty alleviation,Project\n            Affected Persons,project areas,RAP,RESETTLEMENT,resettlement\n            activities,resettlement planning,Resettlement\n            policy,Resettlement programs,resettlement sites,resettlement\n            strategies,resettlers,rural\n            areas,savings,squatters,temporary\n            resettlement,traffic,villages,vulnerable groups"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"E236"},"facets":{}}}
