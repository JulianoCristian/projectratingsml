Lessons learned address three main\n            issues. First, a critical issue during preparation centered\n            on the suitability of the instrument type to support the\n            Government during its period of fiscal pressure: a\n            multi-year investment loan was not adequate due to the need\n            for a fast-disbursing mechanism, similarly was the case of\n            an economic recovery loan, while the selected emergency\n            recovery loan provided greater flexibility to ensure that\n            social spending would not be reduced during the adjustment\n            period. Second, while the loan delineated a number of policy\n            reform actions sector wide - though appropriate - the\n            breadth of the reform program did somehow detract the\n            support to macroeconomic stability, and social efforts. It\n            is thus suggested to consider in the future, a less\n            comprehensive set of actions, particularly those not\n            considered requirements for Board presentation, or\n            effectiveness. Third, although the Government could have\n            obtained additional resources from the International\n            Monetary Fund (IMF), its entry at the time of the loan might\n            have signaled investors with a much worse macroeconomic, and\n            fiscal situation than anticipated; notwithstanding, the\n            IMF's extension of its Staff Monitoring Program,\n            favored more rigorous monitoring of the macroeconomic\n            framework, providing an adequate coordination."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Emergency Economic Rehabilitation\n            Loan

It will bridge part of the\n            fiscal gap generated by the shocks, help to maintain\n            spending in key social programs, and rebuild damaged\n            infrastructure; support private sector-led tourism and\n            related economic activities; and improve overall governance\n            in the country. The loan will help the Government avoid\n            cutbacks in critical expenditures, especially in social\n            programs. Improved public expenditure control,\n            rationalization, and governance and transparency will\n            increase administrative efficiency and improve the delivery\n            of public services. Reforms and actions to improve the\n            framework for private sector development, including a more\n            flexible labor market, will stimulate growth and create\n            employment
