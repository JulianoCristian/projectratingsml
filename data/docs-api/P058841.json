Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            include the following: in the future, the use of learning\n            instrument loans (LILs) or any instrument that circumvents\n            any of the usual safeguard investigation during preparation\n            should be subject not only to the normal tests of\n            eligibility, but also the test o f downside risks, be these\n            technical or the likelihood of adverse public opinion; where\n            the client is not familiar with Bank operations and\n            procedures or is confronting serious impediments to its\n            ability to act on that knowledge, continuous presence of\n            competent Bank representatives is a critical factor in\n            moving dialogue and operations forward; when ambiguity or\n            disagreements arise in implementation, particularly with the\n            evolving focus or importance of an activity, an agreed\n            strategy can become an effective management tool;\n            institutions generally respond more favorably to moderate or\n            gradual change than to radical innovation, particularly when\n            power or stature are being threatened; and finally, while\n            fiduciary accountability requires correct procedures and\n            oversight, the development impact o f the Bank's\n            approach to the issue is very much linked to the sensitivity\n            with which it introduces the qualities of transparency and\n            cost-effectiveness as desirable qualities in procurement transactions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Agricultural Productivity\n            Improvement ;

human resources and poverty reduction improvement, and,\n            institutional capacity strengthening. The two main\n            components of the project consist of: 1) participatory\n            planning and investment, which will include those investment\n            activities based on, and supported by, the development of\n            participatory planning systems. Beginning at the village\n            level, with the creation of the Village Development\n            Committees (VDC), different local government levels will\n            progressively be reached, in a process defined as the Local\n            Development Process (LDP). Through this process the project\n            will finance the costs of participatory rural appraisals,\n            selected on the basis set by the implementation guide\n            criteria. Furthermore, the LDP will assist VDCs in\n            determining the community's development priorities;\n            and, 2) institutional strengthening and project management,\n            i.e., the project will provide resources, both at the\n            provincial and district/commune/village levels, to carry out\n            the establishment of an information systems management;\n
