If approved, the loan would\n            be the Bank's first direct industrial operation since\n            lending was resumed in FY1973. The prime purpose of the Bank\n            loan lies not so much in its financial contribution of\n            somewhat more than 20 percent of estimated project costs as\n            in its effort at institution building in Algeria's\n            building material sector. The project attempts to help SNMC\n            cope with present and future organizational and financial\n            problems created by an ambitious investment program which,\n            between 1974 and 1980, is expected to require fixed asset\n            expenditures in excess of US$2.0 billion and which aims at\n            making Algeria independent in cement and some other building\n            materials by the end of this decade. To this end, cement\n            production is expected to increase from about 1.5 million\n            tons in 1975 to about 8.0 million tons by 1980."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Cement Expansion

Nationale des Materiaux de\n            Construction (SNMC), the Algerian state enterprise for\n            construction materials, through erection of a new 500,000\n            ton per year cement plant near Saida away trom the coast in\n            the rural south; (b) the expansion of the company's\n            distribution network; and (c) a technical assistance program\n            to the Societe Nationale de Comptabilite (SNC), the state\n            accounting and auditing company. If approved, the loan would\n            be the Bank's first direct industrial operation since\n            lending was resumed in FY1973. The prime purpose of the Bank\n            loan lies not so much in its financial contribution of\n            somewhat more than 20 percent of estimated project costs as\n            in its effort at institution building in Algeria's\n            building material sector. The project attempts to help SNMC\n            cope with present and future organizational and financial\n            problems created by an ambitious investment program which,\n            between 1974 and 1980, is expected to require fixed asset\n            expenditures in excess of US$2.0 billion and which aims at\n            making Algeria independent in cement and some other building\n            materials by the end of this decade. To this end, cement\n            production is expected to increase from about 1.5 million\n            tons in 1975 to about 8.0 million tons by 1980."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algerie - Projet d'expansion de la SNMC"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Alg\u00e9rie \u2013 Projet d\u2019expansion de\n            la SNMC : Alg\u00e9rie\u00a0- Projet d\u2019expansion de la SNMC"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1975/11/11773956/algeria-cement-expansion-project-algerie-projet-dexpansion-de-la-snmc","projn":"DZ-Industry I (Cement) -- P004883","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Business in Development,Business Environment","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Algeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100211023424"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other industry","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment,Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Auditing; Budgeting; Cement industry; Cost\n            accounting; Data processing; Market studies; Silos; Trucks,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Auditing; Budgeting; Cement industry; Cost\n            accounting; Data processing; Market studies; Silos; Trucks,"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"874","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Algerie - Projet d'expansion de la SNMC"}}},"facets":{}}}
