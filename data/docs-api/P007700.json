Ratings for the Second\n            Community Forestry Project for Mexico are as follows:\n            outcome was satisfactory; risk to the development outcome\n            was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            include: improved stewardship of natural resources is\n            probably the main contribution of community forestry in\n            Mexico. Community forestry will not wipe out rural poverty\n            in Mexico because the program is necessarily limited to\n            communities with abundant forests and no land conflicts; and\n            even in these communities incomes from forest activities\n            will always make up only a small share of total incomes. Nor\n            by itself will community forestry reverse the declining\n            supply and lack of competitiveness of timber in Mexico. But\n            it is an important part of the broader effort to protect the\n            natural resource base. There are no quick fixes for building\n            community capacity and institutional arrangements to manage\n            and conserve forests. Plugging technical and infrastructure\n            gaps is easy compared to the work of building trust in\n            communities that have been ill served by Mexican governments\n            for decades. The hefty contribution made by Procymaf\n            communities to training and investment initiatives, the\n            broad-based participation in land zoning exercises and the\n            significant survival rate of the forest enterprises\n            established by Procymaf is the best evidence yet that the\n            programs are building capacity and sustainable institutional\n            arrangements. It is important to embed support to individual\n            communities within a broader framework that strengthens\n            cooperation between communities and municipal and state\n            governments and develops a network of professional expertise\n            on forest-centered activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

Hence, a regional vision on the use of natural\n            resources should be fostered, seeking to achieve an economic\n            scale, through greater integration of productive chains.\n            However, the development of community forestry have not been\n            linear, and the cause of structural limitation to access to\n            markets, and lay natural capital, needs to be addressed, so\n            as to access investment funds. While project design was not\n            focused on communities engaged in land conflicts, (rather\n            excluding significant numbers of communities, and depriving\n            such communities from incentives to find a way out of\n            conflict), the opposing decision however, could create a gap\n            between communities engaged in conflict, and those that are\n            not. Moreover, the project did not directly benefit the\n            people living in, or near communities, that are not members,\n            nor own the resources, or share in the decisions, neither in\n            the form of employment and enhanced public services. This\n            issue also raises questions about exacerbating gaps between\n            richer and poorer, and leaving significant numbers of poor\n            behind in the development process. Likewise, the project\n            design did not directly assist women, or help them achieve\n            an active role in community decision making. Project\n            implementation lessons strongly support the frequent\n            interventions of promoters, and technical support in forums,\n            and other regional fora in community assemblies, including\n            individual efforts to disseminate, and analyze options on\n            performance of productive initiatives, which provided\n            invaluable benefits in community strengthening. The\n            viability of the community forestry enterprises, depend on\n            their capacity to compete in global markets. However, the\n            experience with private and parastatal companies has led to\n            many communities with an understandable reluctance to engage\n            in partnerships with the private sector. Hopefully, as\n            communities strengthen their capacity for governance and\n            technical skills, it will be possible to overcome this fear\n            and establish linkages to private sector strategies, and to\n            establish commercial alliances with productive agents,\n            allowing access to new local, and regional markets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

Government's redefined natural resource\n            management strategy. Specific objectives are to: (1) improve\n            natural resource management and conservation by community\n            and ejido forestry resource owners; and (2) increase the\n            range of forestry-based income generating options available\n            to them. The project will have four components: (1)To assist\n            Oaxaca's communities and ejidos (land grants for legal\n            use and enjoyment that, prior to 1992 constitutional\n            reforms, were state-owned and could not be sold) by\n            financing activities, assistance, and training to prepare\n            and update management plans for timber extraction; to\n            prepare conservation plans for forested areas; to integrate\n            resource management and forestry research; to develop\n            silvicultural skills, and control fire and insects; to\n            understand boundary conflict issues; to access credit,\n            markets, and technologies; to increase the efficiency of\n            forestry activities and enterprises, and to improve business\n            and management, especially financial management skills. (2)\n            To strengthen the capacity of Oaxaca's private service\n            providers to assist communities and ejidos, and finance\n            consultants and equipment needed to review and strengthen\n            the government's certification and evaluation program\n            for private sector providers. (3) To promote non-timber\n            forest products in the six priority states with pine-oak\n            forest by financing studies, grants, salaries, consultants,\n            equipment, materials, and publications. (4) providing\n            finance to strengthen state forestry institutions in five\n            priority states with pine-oak forest."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Community Forestry
