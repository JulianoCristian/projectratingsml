The\n            existing concentrator will be dismantled, with some of the\n            equipment to be used in the new concentrator, to be\n            constructed on a more stable site. (b) the Cerro de Pasco\n            Mine Water Treatment Plant: This project would improve the\n            economics of copper recovery by replacing an existing\n            cementation plant with a more efficient solvent extraction\n            and electro-winning plant producing refined copper in place\n            of cement copper, and eliminating CENTROMIN's pollution\n            of the San Juan and Mantaro rivers. Production of copper\n            would be 7,000 STPY by 1979."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - CENTROMIN Expansion Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - CENTROMIN Expansion Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1976/05/1557412/peru-centromin-expansion-project","projn":"PE-Industry Mining -- P007956","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Peru","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101902263272"},"subsc":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,aggregate demand,agricultural\n            output,agricultural production,agriculture,balance of\n            payments,Bank lending,Bank loans,bonds,borrowing,commercial\n            banks,consolidation,cost savings,current assets,current\n            expenditures,current prices,debt,debt financing,debt\n            service,deficits,deposits,devaluation,development\n            projects,development strategy,dividends,ecological\n            conditions,Economic Analysis,economic growth,economic\n            policies,economic rate of return,economic\n            recovery,economics,employment,expenditures,Exploitation,export\n            growth,exports,Financial Analysis,Financial\n            Covenants,financial performance,financial planning,financial\n            stability,financial structure,fish,fisheries,fishing,food\n            production,foreign exchange,GDP,gross national\n            savings,Housing,imports,income,income\n            distribution,inflation,inflation rates,interest\n            rate,interest rates,international reserves,labor\n            productivity,legislation,liquidity,maturities,metals,mines,net\n            sales,oil,operating costs,operating\n            efficiency,organizational structure,pollution,private\n            sector,private sector investment,production\n            inputs,profitability,Property Law,public debt,public\n            enterprises,public Investment,public sector,public sector\n            deficit,RATE OF EXCHANGE,savings,state\n            enterprises,subsidiary,tax,tax revenues,terms of\n            trade,transport,Treasury,wages,water supply,wealth,Working Capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,aggregate demand,agricultural\n            output,agricultural production,agriculture,balance of\n            payments,Bank lending,Bank loans,bonds,borrowing,commercial\n            banks,consolidation,cost savings,current assets,current\n            expenditures,current prices,debt,debt financing,debt\n            service,deficits,deposits,devaluation,development\n            projects,development strategy,dividends,ecological\n            conditions,Economic Analysis,economic growth,economic\n            policies,economic rate of return,economic\n            recovery,economics,employment,expenditures,Exploitation,export\n            growth,exports,Financial Analysis,Financial\n            Covenants,financial performance,financial planning,financial\n            stability,financial structure,fish,fisheries,fishing,food\n            production,foreign exchange,GDP,gross national\n            savings,Housing,imports,income,income\n            distribution,inflation,inflation rates,interest\n            rate,interest rates,international reserves,labor\n            productivity,legislation,liquidity,maturities,metals,mines,net\n            sales,oil,operating costs,operating\n            efficiency,organizational structure,pollution,private\n            sector,private sector investment,production\n            inputs,profitability,Property Law,public debt,public\n            enterprises,public Investment,public sector,public sector\n            deficit,RATE OF EXCHANGE,savings,state\n            enterprises,subsidiary,tax,tax revenues,terms of\n            trade,transport,Treasury,wages,water supply,wealth,Working Capital"}},"owner":"WB Off:Lima-Andean Countries CMU (LCC6C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"P1855"},"facets":{}}}
