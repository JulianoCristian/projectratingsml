Disbursements will be designed so as to\n            provide non-inflationary budget financing. The program\n            supported by the Loan comprises a set of key measures needed\n            to induce a quick response in the real economy to\n            macroeconomic tightening and sharp relative price movements.\n            The program is thus designed to produce the reallocation of\n            resources needed to promote a recovery in sustainable\n            export-led growth, while providing for the most vulnerable\n            groups. The main foci of the program are: privatization;\n            hardening the budget constraint on enterprises; creating a\n            competitive environment; and better targeting of social\n            benefits within fiscal constraints. The program supported by\n            the loan is also intended as a catalyst for balance of\n            payments support and provision of technical assistance by\n            other donors.
