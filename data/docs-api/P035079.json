Lessons outline the expensive cost of\n            environmental protection management, as evidenced in both\n            Kunsan and Pusan. Instead, by thoroughly evaluating the\n            technical alternatives, and their impacts, based on\n            discussions with the environment protection agent, and the\n            initiating investor on the least-cost solution for the\n            society, could excessive costs be avoided. As for private\n            operators of environmental facilities (and contrary to\n            popular belief), these are less likely to be exposed to\n            pressures from local civic groups than the Government,\n            demonstrated by the case of Kunsan, currently the only\n            incinerator for specified waste owned by the Government, but\n            exposed to systematic demands from civic groups. This is\n            likely because the Government is much more sensitive to\n            negative exposure than the private sector. Furthermore, the\n            legal-commercial aspects of the sewerage service requiring a\n            contract between the service provider, and the beneficiary,\n            was not pursued in Pusan. This contractual relationship\n            should be enforced to enable more efficient, and better\n            quality treatment. Additionally, a municipal land use\n            policy, and urban planning blueprint, should be completed\n            prior to the design of wastewater treatment plants,\n            particularly for mixed residential and industrial areas, to\n            include zoning enforcement, and environmental regulations\n            concerning the use, and discharge of

Disposal Project seeks to\n            address environmental concerns regarding wastewater and\n            specified waste disposal in Pusan City and Chunbuk Province.\n            This report consists mainly of the environmental impact\n            assessment for i) the Pusan City Janglim Sewage Treatment\n            Plant; and ii) the Specified Wastes Incineration Plant in\n            Chunbuk Province. To mitigate the impact of air pollution\n            during construction, dust will be reduced by paving road\n            surfaces, spraying water, and controlling the speed limit of\n            vehicles. Sludge generated during operation will be burnt.\n            Sewage and waste water will be treated on the project sites\n            to meet the requirement of water quality. The impact of\n            noise pollution will be mitigated by controlling night work\n            during construction. Sound-proof equipment will be used to\n            reduce noise level during operation. Odor generated by the\n            wastes will be mitigated by isolating the location of the\n            storage facility and by cleaning it periodically. Trucks for\n            waste transportation will be covered. Gas generated from the\n            land fill will be collected and incinerated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Waste Disposal Project :\n            environmental impact assessment and modification plan for\n            Janglim Sewage Treatment Plant Construction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Korea - Waste Disposal Project :\n            environmental impact assessment and modification plan for\n            Janglim Sewage Treatment Plant Construction Project (Vol. 2)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/08/440351/korea-waste-disposal-project-environmental-impact-assessment-modification-plan-janglim-sewage-treatment-plant-construction-project-vol-2","projn":"KR-Waste Disposal Project -- P035079","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Country Strategy & Performance,Energy and Environment,Sustainable Land and Crop Management,Information Technology,General Technology","teratopic":"Rural Development,Energy,Information and Communication Technologies","count":"Korea, Republic of","authors":{"authr":"EnvironmentalManagement Corporation"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101902041944"},"subsc":"Sewerage,Solid waste management","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"Korean","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Energy,Information and Communication Technologies","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Edi,Em,environmental\n            impact,GAS,MII,Oil,Sewage Treatment,tA,tM,Waste,Waste Disposal"},"1":{"cdata!":"Edi,Em,environmental\n            impact,GAS,MII,Oil,Sewage Treatment,tA,tM,Waste,Waste Disposal"}},"owner":"Urban Development Sector Unit (EASUR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"E201"},"facets":{}}}
