Despite\n            there being frequent staff turnover and the country's\n            generally poor security situation, the overall performance\n            of the World Bank is rated as satisfactory. Overall Borrower\n            performance is rated satisfactory: the poor performance of\n            the line ministries was more than compensated by the good\n            perfomance of the implementation agency and by the support\n            provided to FAS (the Social Action Fund). Some of the\n            lessons learned from the project comprise the following: The\n            experiments supported by the project preparation facility\n            helped shape many strategic choices for FAS; by the same\n            token, components which are not properly prepred should be\n            avoided, in this case in the complex field of micro-credit.\n            Social funds with clear and transparent policies and\n            methodologies can work well even in a difficult environment\n            such as Angola. It is important to ensure the early\n            establishment of a comprehensive program of community\n            training in the full cycle of sub-project identification,\n            preparation, contracting, operation, and maintenance, in\n            order to improve sustainability. Organizational arrangements\n            that cause friction and resentment should be avoided, since\n            they harm the delivery of the project: too much harmony and\n            too high salaries for the Office for Monitoring LIving\n            Conditions of the Population (GMCVP) were in part the reason\n            why the project component could not relate and integrated\n            well with INE."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola -

impoverished by the military and\n            economic crises. The objectives of the project are to: 1)\n            improve access to basic services through the provision or\n            rehabilitation of community infrastructure; 2) improve the\n            capacity of communities and nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs) to plan, appraise, manage and maintain investment\n            activities, through experience gained in the project; 3)\n            generate additional income and employment in rural and urban\n            areas through revenue-generating sub-projects; 4) enhance\n            the capacity of Angolan institutions to collect and analyze\n            poverty-related data; and 5) provide a better understanding\n            of the main causes of poverty in order to help formulate\n            effective poverty alleviation strategies and generate\n            adequate policies for socioeconomic development. The project\n            consists of the following two components: 1) a social action\n            fund component which will finance sub-projects identified,\n            prepared and implemented by local communities; and 2) a\n            poverty monitoring component which will finance\n            policy-relevant research on poverty and social issues, and\n            systematic poverty monitoring through household surveys."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola -
