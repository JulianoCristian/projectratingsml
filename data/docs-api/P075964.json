Some lessons learned include: the\n            preparation of a risks and mitigation framework to accompany\n            the political economy assessment is important. The\n            rationale, timing, and the imperative to restructure rather\n            than close a project need to be more closely examined. The\n            World Bank needs to find ways to deal with the challenges of\n            implementing projects in contexts where multiple ministries\n            are involved, like those that will be found in sector wide\n            approaches. A permanent technical unit equipped with a\n            minimum amount of resources and appropriate human resources\n            needs to be put in place in country for the implementation\n            of similar projects. Task team leaders (TTLs) should be\n            commended for designing projects but also in equal measure\n            for staying with a project and seeing that its\n            implementation is successful. Institutional\n            capacity-building requires a coherent plan with measurable\n            indicators. Appropriate governance and anti-corruption\n            measures to accompany the lending instruments will enable\n            timely and efficient monitoring of fiduciary challenges."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon -
