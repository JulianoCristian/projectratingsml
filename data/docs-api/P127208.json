Project for Haiti were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was high risk, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included:  programmatic approach may have been more\n            appropriate in the context of Haiti to ensure greater\n            commitment and stronger implementation; stand-alone\n            operations fail to provide sufficient incentive to meet\n            program objectives. Program design for post-disaster\n            development policy loans should pay great attention to\n            capacity limitations. It would be desirable to perform a\n            stock-taking of available capacity to implement an\n            adjustment program and the nature of the major constraints,\n            to avoid poor implementation. At the same time, concern over\n            the continuing impact of the disaster on the government and\n            implementing agencies should limit the ambition of the\n            program. It is preferable to redesign the operation at\n            appraisal, if necessary, rather than present a high-risk,\n            complex operation to the Board. The importance of\n            cooperation between the units managing technical assistance\n            operations and those managing an adjustment operation is\n            critical for the success of future program. Perhaps some\n            stronger linkages between these functions may be considered\n            in countries where the risks facing adjustment operations\n            are particularly high. Evaluation and monitoring of the\n            program should be a shared responsibility. The design of the\n            evaluation and monitoring mechanism should be discussed and\n            agreed with the government before the appraisal. Supervising\n            the implementation should be a shared responsibility between\n            the Bank and the government; and important changes in the\n            government monitoring team (and vice versa) should be\n            discussed with the Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti -

accountability and transparency and efficient public\n            resource use. Directors endorsed the operation's focus\n            on strengthening public financial management, public\n            procurement, and electricity sector performance. They\n            welcomed the operation's alignment with the\n            Government's recovery and economic programs and with\n            the World Bank Group interim strategy for FY13-14 and its\n            cross-cutting theme of strengthening governance. Directors\n            noted that the proposed grant builds on previous operations\n            and draws on the Energy Sector White Paper developed jointly\n            with Government and donors. Executive Directors underlined\n            the importance of the improvements in economic governance\n            supported by this grant in enhancing Haiti's capacity\n            to transition from reconstruction and recovery to\n            longer-term development, poverty reduction, and economic\n            growth. Directors noted Haiti's considerable energy\n            challenges and urged the expansion of services to\n            under-served populations. They also urged the Bank to use\n            its convening power to help the country secure much-needed\n            aid flows. Directors recognized the risks of Haiti's\n            weak governance and institutional capacity but expressed\n            satisfaction with the risk mitigation framework proposed and\n            expressed their strong support for substantial World Bank\n            Group involvement in continued support to Haiti's\n            reconstruction and development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Economic Reconstruction and Growth\n            Development Policy Grant Project : summary of discussion"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Haiti - Economic Reconstruction\n            and Growth Development Policy Grant Project : summary of discussion"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2013/06/17938397/haiti-economic-reconstruction-growth-development-policy-grant-project-summary-discussion","projn":"HT-Economic Reconstruction And Growth\n            Development Policy Credit -- P127208","docty":"Board Summary","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Post Conflict Reconstruction,Social Accountability,Corporate Law,Achieving Shared Growth","teratopic":"Social Development,Conflict and Development,Law and Development,Poverty Reduction,Public Sector Development","count":"Haiti","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20130628104303"},"theme":"Other public sector governance,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","subsc":"General energy sector,Public administration- Financial Sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Social Development,Conflict and Development,Law and Development,Poverty Reduction,Public Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Board Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, aid flows, Development\n            Policy, economic governance, economic growth, financial\n            management, institutional capacity, Meeting, poverty\n            reduction, procurement, Reconstruction, transparency, White Paper"}},"owner":"Economic Policy Sector (LCSPE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Development Policy Lending"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance","repnb":"78962"},"17776089":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/05/17776089/haiti-economic-reconstruction-growth-development-policy-grant-program","available_in":"French,English,English","fullavailablein":[{"lang":"French","entityid":"000333037_20140211105526","node_id":"17776089"},{"lang":"English","entityid":"000445729_20130702104342","node_id":"17776089"}],"url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/05/17776089/haiti-economic-reconstruction-growth-development-policy-grant-program","new_url":"2013/05/17776089/haiti-economic-reconstruction-growth-development-policy-grant-program","disclosure_date":"2013-05-31T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"Simultaneous Disclosure","disclosure_type_date":"2013-05-31T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2013-05-31T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/05/30/000445729_20130530100927/Rendered/INDEX/672190PGD0P127010Box377322B00OUO090.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/05/30/000445729_20130530100927/Rendered/PDF/672190PGD0P127010Box377322B00OUO090.pdf","docdt":"2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","bdmdt":"2013-06-18T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2013-05-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Economic Reconstruction and Growth\n            Development Policy Grant Program"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Economic\n            Reconstruction and Growth Development Policy Grant Project\n            for Haiti is to support the Government of Haiti's\n            program of sustainable reconstruction and growth.
