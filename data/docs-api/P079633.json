Some lessons learned includes:\n            despite many competing needs in the energy sector, projects\n            should remain selective in their objectives and simple in\n            their design. The combination of power sector reforms,\n            transmission/distribution investments, and biomass energy\n            activities reflected an overly ambitious and diffuse\n            approach that could have benefited from further reflection\n            on sector priorities and risks. Expectations for private\n            sector participation need to be realistic and necessary\n            preconditions should be clearly identified and achievable.\n            It is important to note that the privatization of a state\n            owned electricity utility, such as SBEE (Societe Beninoise\n            d'Energie Electrique - Benin Distribution Power\n            Utility), should therefore be based on its specific\n            condition rather than on a structural liberalization or\n            privatization program. Project objectives and targets should\n            account for endogenous and exogenous risks potentially\n            impacting outcomes and recognize inherent interdependency in\n            the value chain. Institutional development is a\n            transaction-intensive and time-consuming process and such\n            activities should be advanced as much as possible during\n            project

Despite progress in\n            improving access to basic services, achieving the Millennium\n            Development Goals (MDGs) remains a significant challenge.\n            Benin is on track to meet the MDGs for access to potable\n            water in rural areas, eradicating hunger, and reduced\n            HIV/AIDS prevalence.

In June\n            2010, the IMF approved a three-year Extended Credit Facility\n            (ECF) arrangement for Benin, and called for urgent action to\n            reduce the fiscal deficit, restore macroeconomic stability,\n            and make progress on economic reforms. Benin is one of the\n            heavily indebted countries that have graduated from the\n            Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, receiving 100\n            percent cancellation of eligible debt under the Multilateral\n            Debt Relief Initiative. Under the ongoing Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS), the Bank has relied on a combination of\n            development policy and investment operations in order to\n            encourage a coherent approach to supporting structural\n            reforms.
