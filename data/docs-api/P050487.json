First, the coordinating of the\n            multiple facets of IT modernization, e.g. equipment\n            delivery, software testing, network installation, and civil\n            works for computing centers, especially in the diverse all\n            Russia regional frameworks as Federal State Statistical\n            Service (RosStat) has is complex, requires closer monitoring\n            and allowances for unforeseen delays. Relatedly, software\n            contracts require more realistic contractual periods. In\n            general, time allowances should be provided for\n            unforeseeable delays and project risks related to the\n            untimely fulfillment of interrelated operations should be\n            considered during project preparation. A second and positive\n            lesson from the IT experience under STASYS was the prudence\n            of both a systems-design, and a participatory and\n            step-by-step approach taken by RosStat. Finally, the use of\n            an external agency as the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)\n            can still be an appropriate model provided the main\n            beneficiary is fully committed and engaged in project activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russia - Development of the State\n            Statistical System Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russia - Development of
