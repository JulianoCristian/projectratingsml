Lessons learned\n            include: use of pilot activities - the iterative approach of\n            the municipal development component's pilot activities\n            was critical as it allowed sufficient time and resource\n            inputs to develop the capacity of local partners, while fine\n            tuning the methodologies applied to the diverse and rapidly\n            changing local conditions. It also helped to build trust\n            among stakeholders and keep expectations realistic. The\n            guidance provided by a highly qualified local development\n            expert to FAS management was critical to the successful\n            design, implementation, and monitoring of the project's\n            municipal development component pilots. Commitment by local\n            leaders to civic engagement - building working relations of\n            trust and confidence in public officials at the provincial\n            and municipal levels was essential to FAS efforts in\n            promoting effective civic participation in local\n            development. Clear communication of the distinct roles and\n            functions of government and civil society and the way in\n            which they are brought together in a participatory process\n            is essential to bring about recognition and legitimacy of\n            the adopted bottom-up approach of development process.\n            Investment sustainability - community participation through\n            FAS-supported Nucleus Groups were necessary but not\n            sufficient to ensure sustainability of improved\n            infrastructure. FAS III emphasized the importance of\n            operation and maintenance and of linking it with investments\n            by coordinating planning with provincial and municipal\n            authorities as well as to harmonize these with municipal\n            maintenance programs and budgets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola -

The\n            following are components to the project: Component I (a):\n            Community Development (CD). Applying a CDD approach, this\n            component would finance local initiatives to build and\n            restore social and economic infrastructure based on\n            communities' own identification, prioritization,\n            implementation and maintenance of small-scale sub-projects.\n            It will expand and improve access, management and\n            sustainable use of basic social and economic infrastructure,\n            improve governance and build social capital. The CD\n            component will give increasing control over decisions and\n            resources to community groups and local level institutions,\n            including local government; build organizational capacity,\n            and develop accountability mechanisms between communities\n            and formal support institutions. Component I(b): Conflict\n            Impact and Vulnerability Assessment (CIVA). Component I (a)\n            fosters human capital building by bringing communities\n            together to design and implement physical capital\n            rehabilitation, and by building community capacity. However,\n            at the time of project preparation, it is uncertain how the\n            particularity of the post-conflict context constrains or\n            fosters social capital building, which is one of the\n            principal project development objectives.

municipal administrations and municipal councils)\n            with capacity development and financial resources to become\n            proficient in the provision of social and economic services\n

improved, expanded and\n            sustainable utilization of basic social and economic\n            services and to support a governance system where local\n            government and communities can gradually become mutually\n            accountable. There will be limited range of environmental\n            impacts occurring during construction (local pollution).\n            Contractual obligations must include clauses regarding\n            environmental protection focusing specifically on site clean\n            up after construction, waste management during construction,\n            and possibly the rehabilitation of land disturbed during\n            construction. Construction activities such as the\n            circulation of heavy machinery and the chopping down of\n            trees by the workforce for fuel can result in the\n            destruction of intact vegetation such as shade or fruit\n            trees, stream bank vegetation, etc. Localized soil and water\n            (if a small stream is nearby) pollution from incorrect\n            storage and handling of diesel fuel and used engine oil may\n            occur. The accumulation of solid wastes due to construction\n            activities and workforce during construction creates health\n            risks and negative aesthetic impacts. Associated mitigating\n            measures include: Wherever possible avoid removal of trees\n            or other intact vegetation by workforce or circulation of\n            heavy machinery. Carefully select storage area for diesel\n            and ensure proper storage and handling of fuels to prevent\n            localized pollution of soils. Used engine oil should be\n            properly stored in drums and returned to the supplier for\n            recycling or should be disposed of in disposal in proper\n            disposal sites. Remove and dispose of solid wastes in\n            suitable sites. Non-hazardous wastes can be disposed of in a\n            locally dug pit and covered with top soil on closure.

The FAS II project involves multiple\n            sub-projects, some of which may require land and asset\n            takings. Specific investment decisions are usually made\n            during the life of the project. A resettlement policy\n            framework (RPF) which guides and governs the project as\n            sub-projects are selected for inclusion. An RPF is prepared\n            in situations where specific investment sites and details\n            (i.e. individual sub-projects) are not known. It is a\n            statement of the policy, principles, institutional\n            arrangements and procedures that will be followed for each\n            sub-project involving compensation and/or resettlement. It\n            sets out the elements common to all the sub-projects and\n            allows for the principles and processes to be agreed. The\n            second element involves individual resettlement action plans\n            (RAPs), based on the common policies, principles and\n            arrangements contained in the RPF; the RPF and the RAPs\n            being fully complementary to one another. They are\n            undertaken for each sub-project where displacement will\n            occur, once more specific details of the location and nature\n            of the sub-project is known.
