The project provides various lessons: 1) The\n            project financing plan should carefully evaluate the\n            government's ability to meet counterpart funding\n            requirements, and macroeconomic factors and conditions must\n            be taken into consideration during preparation. 2) External\n            financing usually pays more attention to infrastructure and\n            environmental mitigation over agricultural development. 3)\n            Delays in project implementation could have been avoided or\n            shortened. 4) Risks should be properly identified, and\n            mitigating measures adopted. 5) An independent and\n            self-sustaining entity for project administration, operation\n            and maintenance is essential to ensure long-term\n            sustainability. 6) Good baseline data and an early\n            implementation of effective monitoring system are essential.\n            7) Successful diversification of crop production depends on\n            obtaining small farmers' confidence. 8) Agricultural\n            credits are always a decisive factor in becoming a\n            successful farmer. 9) Selection of beneficiaries in an\n            important element in assuring long-term sustainability. 10)\n            It is important to maintain a well-balanced mix of\n            small/medium farmers as beneficiaries to maximize the\n            development impact. 11) Rules should be thoroughly thought\n            out and then applied."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Jaiba Irrigation
