Some lessons learned included: it\n            is recommended that the grant-based financing scheme be\n            piloted in new schools to test its attractiveness and\n            merits, its potential impact on school performance as well\n            as to appreciate the degree of buy-in by teachers and School\n            Management Committees (SMCs). Ministry of Education (MOE) is\n            shifting to grants-based financing system, where resources\n            going to institutions will be linked more closely to\n            students on a per capita basis, rather than to teachers as\n            it is currently the case. A draft grants-based financing\n            system has been finalized but not yet adopted and a decision\n            was taken to suspend Monthly Pay Order (MPO) for new non\n            government schools. As a result, newly registered schools\n            are likely to experience financial constraints which may\n            have adverse effect on their performance. There is a need to\n            improve the capacity of Bangladesh Bureau of Education\n            Information and Statistics (BANBEIS) to provide regular\n            updates on schools and better monitor education outcomes\n            since the last school census was conducted in 1999 and an\n            update was undertaken in 2005. BANBEIS is expecting to start\n            by June 2008 the next census as it is already approved and\n            the process of releasing the funds has begun. There may also\n            be a need to develop a platform for integrating multiple\n            databases that fall under MOE as was already evidenced by\n            the uniformization of school codes between Education Boards\n            and BANBEIS. This integration process, across various units\n            of MOE, would, for instance, help to institutionalize\n            student learning assessment as Secondary Education Quality\n            and Access Enhancement Project (SEQAEP) project intends to\n            do by benchmarking learning levels in Bangladesh to\n            international standards such as Trends in International\n            Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) or Program for\n            International Student Assessment (PISA)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Education Sector Development\n            Support

This Simplified\n            Implementation Completion Report provides the findings and\n            implications for subsequent operations, indicating this\n            Programmatic Education Sector Adjustment Credit, as the\n            first in a series of proposed policy reform credits in the\n            education sector, has strong links to the overall\n            Development Support Credits of the Bank, and to the Poverty\n            Reduction Growth Facility supported by the International\n            Monetary Fund (IMF). Notwithstanding, it is however\n            realistic to assume that future reform initiatives might\n            face resistance: the primary focus of this project was to\n            establish institutional arrangements, and policy measures to\n            ease governance problems - the focus of future proposed\n            operations will be to deepen those reforms. Key among\n            reforms will be the establishment of the autonomous NTRCA,\n            and increased emphasis on teacher training, continuation of\n            the process of privatization of textbook production at the\n            secondary level, and potential extension of this process to\n            the primary level, continued emphasis on linking financing\n            of institutions to performance, and ensuring a significant\n            role of communities in school management. For these reforms\n            to succeed, it is critical that there is continued political\n            commitment of the Government to reforms, of its ownership of\n            the results, and of public receptivity of the reform\n            initiatives. It is important to note that the first\n            programmatic credit was discussed, negotiated and\n            implemented at a time when the Government, overcoming its\n            initial reservations, increasingly fortified its position to\n            carry forward the reform actions. The timing was also\n            appropriate, reasonably soon after the elections."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Programmatic Education Sector\n            Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Programmatic\n            Education Sector Adjustment Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6030918/bangladesh-programmatic-education-sector-adjustment-credit-project","projn":"BD-Education Sector Development Support\n            Credit -- P077789","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050628104955"},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Secondary education,Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absenteeism, academic achievement, academic\n            year, Achievement, Achievements, addition, apprehension,\n            class sizes, climate, colleges, community involvement,\n            community participation, curricula, curriculum development,\n            decision making, Development Goals, Development program,\n            Drawing, Dropout rates, economic growth, education\n            administration, education level, Education Policy, education\n            quality, EDUCATION SECTOR, Education Statistics, education\n            system, educational access, educational institutions,\n            educational outcomes, employment, Engineering, enrollment,\n            enrollment rates, Gender parity, girls, Gross enrollment,\n            Gross enrollment rates, Human Development, Improved Service\n            Delivery, Institutional Development, intervention,\n            leadership, local level, managers, motivation, National\n            Curriculum, National Education, Net enrollment, parents,\n            partnership, policy reform, Poverty Reduction, Primary\n            Education, primary focus, printing, private sector, Public\n            Expenditure, qualified teachers, quality education, quality\n            of education, rural areas, school facilities, School\n            Management, School Management Committees, school\n            performance, school quality, Secondary Education, secondary\n            level, secondary schools, Stipends, teacher, teacher\n            certification, teacher effectiveness, Teacher Quality,\n            teacher recruitment, teacher training, teachers, Teachers\n            Associations, teaching, teaching quality, Technical\n            Education, textbook production, textbooks, Vocational Training"}},"owner":"S.A.

An\n            autonomous Teacher registration and certification agency\n            will be established, responsible for developing a roster of\n            pre-qualified, and certified teachers. An apex institution\n            will also be established to manage teacher training, and\n            regulate training institutions, and, set standards for new,\n            and in-service teachers. Finally, an enhanced transparency\n            in textbook production and relevant, demand-driven\n            curriculum will focus on privatizing textbook production,\n            through the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Programmatic Education Sector\n            Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Programmatic\n            Education Sector Adjustment Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/07/4998399/bangladesh-programmatic-education-sector-adjustment-credit-project","projn":"BD-Education Sector Development Support\n            Credit -- P077789","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Curriculum & Instruction,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040804112711"},"subsc":"Other social services,Vocational training,Secondary education","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absenteeism,accreditation,achievement,Achievements,addition,attending\n            school,classrooms,climate,community involvement,community\n            participation,composition,curriculum,decentralization,Development\n            Goals,Development Program,economic\n            growth,education,Education expenditures,education\n            institutions,education level,education outcomes,education\n            quality,Education Sector,education system,educational\n            access,effective teachers,employment,enrollment,Enrollment\n            Rate,Enrollment rates,equitable access,families,female\n            enrollment,Gender\n            Parity,girls,governance,instruction,international\n            standards,interventions,labor force,labor\n            market,learning,learning materials,levels of education,local\n            level,managers,motivation,National Curriculum,Net\n            Enrollment,parents,policy reform,poverty reduction,Primary\n            Education,primary enrollment,primary school,primary\n            schools,private sector,public expenditure,quality\n            assurance,school construction,school hours,School\n            Management,School Management Committees,school\n            performance,school quality,schooling,screening,Secondary\n            Education,secondary enrollment,secondary level,secondary\n            schools,significant challenges,stipends,strengthening school\n            management,teacher,Teacher Effectiveness,teacher\n            qualifications,teacher quality,teacher recruitment,teacher\n            training,teachers,teachers salaries,teaching,teaching\n            quality,teaching staff,tertiary education,Textbook production,Textbooks,universities"},"1":{"cdata!":"absenteeism,accreditation,achievement,Achievements,addition,attending\n            school,classrooms,climate,community involvement,community\n            participation,composition,curriculum,decentralization,Development\n            Goals,Development Program,economic\n            growth,education,Education expenditures,education\n            institutions,education level,education outcomes,education\n            quality,Education Sector,education system,educational\n            access,effective teachers,employment,enrollment,Enrollment\n            Rate,Enrollment rates,equitable access,families,female\n            enrollment,Gender\n            Parity,girls,governance,instruction,international\n            standards,interventions,labor force,labor\n            market,learning,learning materials,levels of education,local\n            level,managers,motivation,National Curriculum,Net\n            Enrollment,parents,policy reform,poverty reduction,Primary\n            Education,primary enrollment,primary school,primary\n            schools,private sector,public expenditure,quality\n            assurance,school construction,school hours,School\n            Management,School Management Committees,school\n            performance,school quality,schooling,screening,Secondary\n            Education,secondary enrollment,secondary level,secondary\n            schools,significant challenges,stipends,strengthening school\n            management,teacher,Teacher Effectiveness,teacher\n            qualifications,teacher quality,teacher recruitment,teacher\n            training,teachers,teachers salaries,teaching,teaching\n            quality,teaching staff,tertiary education,Textbook production,Textbooks,universities"}},"owner":"S.A.
