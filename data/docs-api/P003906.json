The project provides a\n            demonstration of the benefits of energy conservation in\n            industry through the implementation of energy efficiency\n            schemes in large fertilizer plants. With that in mind, the\n            proposed project includes: (a) the establishment of an\n            Energy Conservation Center to assist the industrial sector\n            to realize the substantial potential for reducing energy\n            costs through conservation and rationalization activities;\n            and (b) the implementation of specific energy efficiency\n            investments aimed at reducing current energy use and\n            optimizing production capacity. The establishment of the\n            Center would help Indonesia to tap the substantial potential\n            demand for energy conservation services in the industrial\n            sector and would complement the Government's efforts to\n            promote energy conservation through appropriate incentives,\n            including a realistic energy pricing policy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Industrial Energy Conservation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Industrial Energy\n            Conservation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/09/739605/indonesia-industrial-energy-conservation-project","projn":"ID-Industrial Energy Conservation -- P003906","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Environment,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Urban Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925234534"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other industry","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"boilers,coal,Coal Mining,commercial\n            energy,Crude Oil,demand for energy,domestic\n            energy,efficiency of energy,efficiency of energy\n            use,efficient energy use,electric power,electric power\n            generation,Electronics,energy auditing,Energy audits,Energy\n            Conservation,energy conservation measures,energy\n            consumption,energy costs,energy efficiency,energy efficiency\n            investments,energy prices,energy pricing,energy\n            resources,energy savings,energy sector,energy\n            strategy,energy supplies,energy\n            users,Engineering,Engineering\n            services,fuels,furnaces,geothermal\n            energy,heat,Housing,increasing energy\n            efficiency,Irrigation,kerosene,natural gas,oil\n            energy,Operating costs,petroleum,petroleum products,power\n            generation,pressure,production capacity,Public\n            Works,Sanitation,Transport,Urban Development,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"boilers,coal,Coal Mining,commercial\n            energy,Crude Oil,demand for energy,domestic\n            energy,efficiency of energy,efficiency of energy\n            use,efficient energy use,electric power,electric power\n            generation,Electronics,energy auditing,Energy audits,Energy\n            Conservation,energy conservation measures,energy\n            consumption,energy costs,energy efficiency,energy efficiency\n            investments,energy prices,energy pricing,energy\n            resources,energy savings,energy sector,energy\n            strategy,energy supplies,energy\n            users,Engineering,Engineering\n            services,fuels,furnaces,geothermal\n            energy,heat,Housing,increasing energy\n            efficiency,Irrigation,kerosene,natural gas,oil\n            energy,Operating costs,petroleum,petroleum products,power\n            generation,pressure,production capacity,Public\n            Works,Sanitation,Transport,Urban Development,Water Supply"}},"owner":"Indonesia Headquarters Unit (EACIQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"P4643"},"facets":{}}}
