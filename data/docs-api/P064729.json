These practices, developed and applied for the\n            protection and sustainable management of natural forest\n            resources in pilot areas in China, will provide models for\n            wider replication under the government's Natural Forest\n            Protection Program (NFPP). There are three main project\n            components, which will be financed over a period of seven\n            years. The first component includes the following\n            subcomponents: 1) Natural forest management; yield\n            regulation and control policy studies; implementation of\n            forest management plans through demonstrations, non-timber\n            forest products domestication, and establishment of yield\n            plots to model growth and yield and assess biodiversity\n            change; and monitoring and evaluation; 2) forest management\n            training and vocational training; and community development\n            activities. The Protected areas Management component\n            supports conservation and improved management of\n            biodiversity of global importance in selected, high priority\n            nature reserves.

Negative\n            environmental and social impacts and their mitigations are\n            addressed. The risk of serious social risks will be\n            minimized by setting up conflict resolution and appeal\n            mechanisms; and establishing principles and procedures for\n            awarding fair compensation for involuntary loss of land.

Development Project, which supports\n            protected areas management, natural forest management, and\n            the establishes wood plantations and tree orchards. Negative\n            environmental and social impacts and their mitigations are\n            addressed. The risk of serious social risks will be\n            minimized by setting up conflict resolution and appeal\n            mechanisms; and establishing principles and procedures for\n            awarding fair compensation for involuntary loss of land. The\n            possibility of friction between participating villages and\n            non-participating villages in and adjacent to nature\n            reserves has been raised in the social assessment. Initial\n            assistance will be given to those communities most affected\n            by management programs or, conversely, those who have the\n            most direct impact on natural resources within the nature\n            reserve. To avoid conflicts, decisions will be transparent\n            and the reasons explained to all interested communities.\n            Planning services and community conservation funding may be\n            extended in time to other priority communities according to\n            understood selection criteria. To reduce the susceptibility\n            of horticultural crops to insect and microbiological attack\n            and the concomitant excess use of pesticides, fungicides,\n            etc., a diversity of crops will be offered; crop selection\n            will consider farmer preferences, site conditions and market\n            prospects; farmer training and extension services will be\n
