The\n            Economic Recovery Credit Project had the following ratings:\n            outcome was highly satisfactory; sustainability was likely;\n            institutional development impact was not evaluable; Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The Economic Management Credit Project had the\n            following ratings: outcome was moderately satisfactory;\n            sustainability was likely; institutional development impact\n            was modest; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. The Third Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project had the following ratings: outcome\n            was moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability was likely;\n            institutional development impact was modest; Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The main lessons learned from this review are:\n            1) Country ownership matters very much. The components of\n            the loans that were owned by the country, such as the public\n            resource management and some of the structural adjustment\n            components were generally successfully implemented; 2) As a\n            general rule, it would be very useful for the Bank to listen\n            better and to go to extra lengths to explain it s positions,\n            and to solicit views and seek genuine agreement with country\n            authorities. This could improve country ownership of\n            programs; 3) It is important to keep a good and substantive\n            dialogue with the main development partners; again by\n            listening better to their view points, keeping them better\n            informed about those of the Bank, and seeking to reach\n            agreements when possible; and 4) As has happened already\n            with the Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit, it would be\n            preferable to keep the design of adjustment operations\n            simple and focused on a limited number of key policy areas,\n            whose implementation can be realistically expected within\n            the short disbursement period dictated by an adjustment operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - First

- Economic Recovery Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall achievement of the program\n            objectives is rated as substantial. The main reason for\n            success was the strong ownership of reform agenda and\n            sustained commitment by the Malian Government to strengthen\n            its policy reforms and its open dialogue with the Bank. The\n            following factors, subject to Government control, positively\n            affected the program implementation: (i) strong commitment\n            of the Government and its open dialogue with the Bank-; (ii)\n            the Government's clear vision of the objectives of the\n            economic reform program and its willingness to adopt the\n            appropriate means to achieve the objectives; (iii) an\n            effective mass media campaign to inform and educate the\n            public about the merits and consequences of the devaluation\n            and the accompanying policy reforms; and (iv) effective\n            utilization of available funds from other donors which were\n            used to help design and implement economic reforms. Overall,\n            IDA's experience with the ERC has been positive. The\n            following observations emerge from the ERC's\n            implementation record and outcome: (i) Strong Government\n            Commitment. A sine qua non for success in the design and\n            implementation of an emergency financing program is strong\n            and sustained Government commitment to the policy reform\n            package, as well as dynamic leadership and full ownership of\n            the program by the Government. (ii) Up-front\n            Conditionalities and Single Tranche Disbursement. As a\n            short-term financing instrument, the ERC was well designed\n            to respond on time to the immediate constraints faced by\n            Mali after the devaluation. (iii) Retroactive Financing. In\n            light of the urgent and extraordinary nature of the ERC, the\n            Bank decided on an exceptional basis to extend the period of\n            retroactive financing to August 2, 1993, about nine months\n            prior to credit effectiveness, in lieu of the normal four\n            months guidelines.  This decision led to faster disbursement\n            arrangements and facilitated quick and easy availability of\n            the credit proceeds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Cr\u00e9dit d'Appui

- Economic Recovery Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall achievement of the program\n            objectives is rated as substantial. The main reason for\n            success was the strong ownership of reform agenda and\n            sustained commitment by the Malian Government to strengthen\n            its policy reforms and its open dialogue with the Bank. The\n            following factors, subject to Government control, positively\n            affected the program implementation: (i) strong commitment\n            of the Government and its open dialogue with the Bank-; (ii)\n            the Government's clear vision of the objectives of the\n            economic reform program and its willingness to adopt the\n            appropriate means to achieve the objectives; (iii) an\n            effective mass media campaign to inform and educate the\n            public about the merits and consequences of the devaluation\n            and the accompanying policy reforms; and (iv) effective\n            utilization of available funds from other donors which were\n            used to help design and implement economic reforms. Overall,\n            IDA's experience with the ERC has been positive. The\n            following observations emerge from the ERC's\n            implementation record and outcome: (i) Strong Government\n            Commitment. A sine qua non for success in the design and\n            implementation of an emergency financing program is strong\n            and sustained Government commitment to the policy reform\n            package, as well as dynamic leadership and full ownership of\n            the program by the Government. (ii) Up-front\n            Conditionalities and Single Tranche Disbursement. As a\n            short-term financing instrument, the ERC was well designed\n            to respond on time to the immediate constraints faced by\n            Mali after the devaluation. (iii) Retroactive Financing. In\n            light of the urgent and extraordinary nature of the ERC, the\n            Bank decided on an exceptional basis to extend the period of\n            retroactive financing to August 2, 1993, about nine months\n            prior to credit effectiveness, in lieu of the normal four\n            months guidelines.  This decision led to faster disbursement\n            arrangements and facilitated quick and easy availability of\n            the credit proceeds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Economic Recovery Credit

12, 1994. The Economic Recovery Credit\n            Project will support the post-devaluation reform program as\n            outlined in the government's Statement of Economic and\n            Social Policy whose main objectives are private sector led\n            growth and the alleviation of poverty. The Malian government\n            has already taken a series of key macroeconomic and\n            structural measures to regain and consolidate\n            competitiveness. The credit is designed to support the\n            implementation of these measures in 1994. The major measures\n            are: (a) the devaluation of the CFA franc from 50 CFAF to\n            100 CFAF/1 FF; (b) increase in the producer price of prime\n            quality cotton by at least 35%; (c) a program of social\n            measures to attenuate the effects of the devaluation on\n            vulnerable groups; (d) prudent demand management policies to\n            reduce absorption by the public sector and limit wage\n            increases; (e) reduction and simplification of tariffs and\n            domestic taxation; and (f) protection of social sector expenditures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Economic Recovery Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - Economic Recovery Credit
