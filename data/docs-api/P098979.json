Of\n            the five project development objectives indicators, three\n            were achieved, one was partially achieved, and one was not\n            achieved. Of the nine intermediate outcome indicators, two\n            were not achieved, while the remaining indicators were\n            achieved. Significant lessons learned during the course of\n            project implementation were: 1) a fragile government working\n            in an unstable environment cannot be expected to produce\n            results quickly, particularly when public institutions are\n            weak; 2) having a Bank executed trust fund paired with a\n            recipient executed trust fund proved to be an extremely\n            constructive approach which might be replicated elsewhere;\n            3) building government capacity to collect data and do\n            policy analysis does not necessarily mean there are\n            meaningful results in terms of policy reform and poverty\n            reduction; and 4) if risks to development outcomes are very\n            high, having a long list of mitigation measures should not\n            be used to create an illusion that risks no longer exist."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iraq -

The extension\n            of the closing date is necessary to ensure that the World\n            Bank has sufficient time to deliver technical assistance\n            (TA) activities and build capacity for relevant policy\n            analysis of data and production of the poverty estimates and\n            their determinants, which will feed into the formulation of\n            the second Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) in 2013. The\n            need for extension arises from the delays in forming a\n            government after the 2010 election, which slowed down the\n            functioning of the government, as well as security concerns\n            impacting on the ability to conduct field activities. This\n            will be the fourth and final extension of the closing date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Iraq - Household Survey and\n            Policies for Poverty Reduction Project : restructuring :\n            Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/09/16907912/iraq-household-survey-policies-poverty-reduction-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"IQ-Iraq: Household Survey And Policies For\n            Poverty Reduction -- P098979","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Urban Partnerships & Poverty,Housing & Human Habitats,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Iraq","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20121102003943"},"theme":"Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting,Social safety nets,Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring,Other economic management,Improving labor markets","subsc":"General public administration sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"analytical methods, audits, Bank policies,\n            Borrower, Disbursement, expenditure, female, gender,\n            household income, Household Surveys, investment projects,\n            living standards, political uncertainty, poverty analysis,\n            poverty assessment, Poverty Assessments, poverty estimates,\n            poverty line, POVERTY REDUCTION, POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT,\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy, Poverty Reduction Strategy\n            Paper, Project beneficiaries, Project Management, project\n            objectives, Safeguard Policies, safety, safety nets, Social\n            Impact Assessments, targeting, Trust Fund, TRUST FUNDS"}},"owner":"Econ.
