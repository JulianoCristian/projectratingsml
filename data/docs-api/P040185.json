Lessons\n            learned from the project: Transfer of Bank procurement\n            administration to the Country Office specialists was\n            efficient and cost-effective, as it facilitated project\n            implementation through prompt reviews, improved\n            communication and follow-up. Achievement of project\n            objectives was greatly facilitated by the degree of\n            ownership demonstrated by the client. Fees charged for\n            wastewater services need to be converted to a wastewater\n            tariff so that the funds collected become legal revenue of\n            the wastewater company. As in other China urban\n            infrastructure projects of similar vintage, costs are\n            overestimated through mandatory use of government schedules\n            of rates (which have proved to be 20 percent to 30 percent\n            higher than contract awards). Public-private partnerships in\n            the form of management contracts and financial participation\n            through sale of stock is becoming increasingly popular in\n            the water supply and wastewater sectors. The experience with\n            the expansion of the Jinan water distribution network not\n            being completed per the dated covenant points to the fact\n            that works integral to the project should be included in the\n            project, at least as reserve procurement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Shandong Environment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Shandong Environment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/6953733/china-shandong-environment-project","projn":"CN-Shandong Environment Project -- P040185","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20060727134628"},"subsc":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"air pollution, air pollution control, air\n            quality, aquifers, audits, augmentation, available water,\n            Basin Commission, benefit streams, BOD, coal, COD,\n            collection networks, Competitive Bidding, Construction,\n            contract management, cost analysis, cost recovery,\n            counterpart funding, debt, demand management, discharge,\n            economic development, economic factors, economists,\n            electricity demand, emissions, energy efficiency,\n            Environmental, environmental degradation, environmental\n            health, environmental impacts, environmental issues,\n            environmental management, Environmental policies,\n            environmental problems, Environmental Protection,\n            environmental regulations, Exchange Rate, expenditures,\n            flood protection, groundwater, groundwater resources, heat\n            exchanger, heating, industrial growth, municipal\n            authorities, Municipal Government, municipal governments,\n            municipal wastewater, municipal water, municipalities,\n            Natural springs, Nitrous Oxide, operational management,\n            performance indicators, pipeline, pipelines, Pollution,\n            pollution abatement, pollution control, pollution control\n            functions, power generation, power plants, private operator,\n            private participation, programs, Project Management,\n            Provincial Government, pumping, pumping station, pumping\n            stations, raw water, recycling, regulatory agencies,\n            reservoirs, resources management, River Basin, River Water,\n            sanitation, savings, Sea, service area, service delivery,\n            service improvements, Sewage Treatment, sewer system,\n            surface water, surface water supply, sustainable management,\n            tariff revisions, thermal power, towns, urban areas, urban\n            environment, utilities, utility operations, utility\n            operators, Wastewater, wastewater collection, Wastewater\n            Management, wastewater operations, wastewater pollution,\n            wastewater sector, Wastewater Treatment, wastewater\n            treatment capacity, Wastewater Treatment Plant, water, water\n            distribution, water meters, water quality, Water quality\n            data, Water resource, water resources management, water\n            reuse, water scarcity, water source, water sources, water\n            Supply, water Supply Company, Water Supply Management, water\n            use, wells, WTP"}},"owner":"Urban Development Sector Unit (EASUR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF029277-PHRD-SHANDONG ENVIRONMENT PROJ.

Reservoir\n            Project mitigation measures include: (1) preventing seepage\n            from salinization by: (a) placing a soil film on the slope\n            of the box dam and connecting it with another soil film\n            vertically buried under the ground of the dam base; and (b)\n            redesigning and re-planning the discharge system for\n            adjacent farmland; (2) protecting water quality by: (a)\n            burying water delivery pipes underground; and (b) using\n            plowing to prevent the sedimentation basins and sand\n            stockyards from desertification. Mitigation measures taken\n            for the Wastewater Project include using advanced machines,\n            rationally arranging construction time, high construction\n            efficiency, spraying water and covering the soil to reduce\n            the impacts of noise and dust to minimum level. The Heating\n            Project will mitigate the environmental impacts during the\n            construction phase by: (1) burying the pipeline network\n            under land which does not have natural resources; (2)\n            strengthening traffic management so that construction does\n            not interfere with the main traffic arteries and commercial\n            streets; (3) using advanced low-noise machines to reduce\n            noise disturbances; and (4) spraying water on the sands and\n            soils at the roadsides to reduce raising dust. After\n            operation, the Heating Project will use the following\n            measures: (1) removing dust by water film, adding limestone\n            for desulfurization, and equipping the coalyard with a water\n            spraying instrument to reduce air pollution; (2) using low\n            noise machines and soundproof facilities; (3) transporting\n            ash and cinder to a brick factory; and (4) discharging\n            wastewater to a treatment plant. Mitigation during the\n            construction and operation phases in the CHP Project\n            comprise measures similar to those to be used in the Heating Project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
