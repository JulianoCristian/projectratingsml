This restructuring\n            is in response to a request received from the Government of\n            Yemen (GoY) dated March 14, 2012, and a request for partial\n            cancellation in the Aide Memoire dated June 5, 2012. The\n            restructuring is within the broader context of the\n            Bank's renewed engagement in Yemen and follows a\n            sustained period of civil unrest; a deteriorating political\n            and security situation, and the resulting suspension of\n            disbursement across the Yemen portfolio from July 28, 2011\n            to January 20, 2012.  The closing date requires an extension\n            of 15 months in order to compensate for additional delays\n            resulting from the recent socio-political unrest in the\n            country since early 2011, and the ensuing Bank suspension of\n            disbursements. Extension of the closing date will enable\n            both the completion of key civil works including\n            rehabilitation of fisheries ports and construction of access\n            roads, and the undertaking of training for target\n            stakeholders on their roles and responsibilities relating to\n            fisheries resource management and conservation. The borrower\n            has notified the Bank of a partial cancellation of credit\n            proceeds. Balance funds after cancellation will be\n            reallocated among project categories. The results framework\n            and monitoring have been revised to accurately reflect\n            changes needed to enhance the monitoring indicators and\n            corresponding end-of-project target values, in line with the\n            stated project development objectives that will remain\n            unchanged and the new closing date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen, Republic of - Fisheries\n            Resource Management and Conservation Project : restructuring\n            (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/08/16630140/yemen-republic-fisheries-resource-management-conservation-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"RY-Fisheries Resource Management And\n            Conservation -- P086886","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Fisheries and Aquaculture,Fishing Industry,Housing & Human Habitats,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Coastal and Marine Environment","teratopic":"Environment,Rural Development,Industry,Agriculture,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20120822235929"},"theme":"Other rural development,Rural non-farm income generation","subsc":"Animal production,Ports, waterways and shipping,Central government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Rural Development,Industry,Agriculture,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aquaculture, Cities, coast, communities,\n            Cooperatives, description, equipment, extension, extension\n            services, female, fish, fish quality, Fisheries, fisheries\n            management, Fisheries Resource, fisheries resources,\n            fisheries sector, fishermen, Fishers, fishing, fishing port,\n            fleet, high sea, households, hygiene, interventions,\n            laboratories, Landing, marine fish, portfolio, sardines"}},"owner":"Agriculture and Rural (MNSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"majtheme":"Rural development","repnb":"68496"},"facets":{}}}
