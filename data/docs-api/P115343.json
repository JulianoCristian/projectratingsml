Some lessons learned included: project's\n            results framework was feasible, centered on basic output\n            indicators that could have been measured realistically, and\n            that the project could impact, with some stretch, during its\n            short implementation period. For an investment operation,\n            the design of a project's results framework should be\n            based on readily available and easy to measure data; the\n            ability of the implementing agency to monitor; and on\n            indicators that measure impacts that can be (directly)\n            attributed to the project. While for a project of medium- to\n            longer-term implementation it is desirable to measure\n            intermediate or final outcomes, a project of shorter\n            duration cannot be expected to influence these. Similarly,\n            while it may be desirable to have more complex indicators,\n            improperly established monitoring systems could result in\n            challenges when measuring progress. Therefore, it will be\n            preferable to create indicators that are simple, and easy to\n            quantify and measure. Similarly, programmatic-type\n            operations provide an appropriate instrument for\n            implementing, learning, adjusting, and improving. But, for\n            these benefits, follow-on operations need to evaluate,\n            learn, and revise adjusting activities to account for\n            capacities and realities. Significant attention is directed\n            toward incorporating 'lessons learned,' but\n            projects often summarize lessons of similar or other\n            operations without sufficiently adjusting them to\n            incorporate past lessons. This project's design and\n            implementation are examples of best practices in terms of\n            reflecting learning, and adjusting adequately to improve results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan -
