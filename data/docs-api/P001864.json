Project\n            sustainability is rated unlikely in the long term. both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances were assessed as\n            unsatisfactory because project objectives were overly\n            ambitious, disbursement conditions for research delayed\n            component start-up, no guidelines for participatory on-farm\n            research were provided, economic analysis was rudimentary,\n            project management was not intensely supervised, the\n            Borrower did not provide timely counterpart funds,\n            correction actions were too slow in addressing project fund\n            mismanagement. Lessons learned included the following:\n            Farmer training should also involve functional literacy\n            programs and the training of village specialists in critical\n            areas of equipment maintenance. In situations where input\n            and output markets are weak or non-existent, agricultural\n            services cannot limit themselves to generating and diffusing\n            technologies--they must either directly or indirectly assist\n            producers to develop strong organizations at the local and\n            higher levels that can address these issues. To extend the\n            reach of extension agents and to improve cost-effectiveness\n            and sustainability of interventions, the use of\n            para-professionals is an ideal tool. In general, training,\n            technology generation, and transfer systems should be set up\n            nationwide on a demand-driven basis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Agricultural
