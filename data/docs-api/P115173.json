expenditures; and (ii) improve\n            competitiveness by enhancing secondary education attainment,\n            facilitating market entry in the telecommunications and\n            insurance

Finally, the DPL-DDO will provide a contingent line\n            of credit to the Ministry of Finance in case a worsening in\n            the economic environment makes the financing of the deficit\n
