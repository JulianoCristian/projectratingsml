However, in order to maintain the momentum of the\n            institutional and policy reforms for the sector initiated\n            over the past few years, this technical assistance project\n            would promote and support the sound regulatory,\n            institutional and financial development of the\n            telecommunications sector.  The project thus provides\n            consultancy services and equipment for: (a) strenghthening\n            NTC within the MOTC; (b) a tariff study; (c) radio frequency\n            management; (d) network planning; and (e) reviewing training\n            needs, plus fellowships.  The project would provide MOTC/NTC\n            with the means to adequately regulate existing sector\n            operations, lay the groundwork for future major physical\n            investments once the macro-economic situation improves, and\n            ensure viable private sector operation, consistent with the\n            public interest."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -
