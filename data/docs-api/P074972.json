The ratings for the Financial Sector Adjustment\n            Loan (FSAL) Project for Ukraine were as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was negligible\n            to low; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Major lessons from FSAL\n            are the importance of a sound legislative and regulatory\n            framework in the financial system, and the greater role of\n            the country's overall economic performance, as well as\n            market forces, than of formal technical assistance, in\n            achieving improvements in specific financial institutions.\n            In particular:, (i) establishing a sound legislative and\n            regulatory framework for the financial sector is a\n            necessary, but not sufficient, condition for financial\n            sector development; (ii) strengthening the supervisory and\n            enforcement capacity of the supervisory agency is essential\n            to achieve the benefits of a sound legal and regulatory\n            frame; (iii) technical assistance to strengthen poor\n            performing institutions has poor results without a strong\n            demand-pull, mainly from market forces; and (iv)\n            restructuring and improving the performance of state-owned\n            financial institutions is a slow and risky proposition in a\n            poor governance environment. The ratings for the First and\n            Second Programmatic Adjust Loan projects (PAL I and PAL II)\n            are as follows: outcome sustainability was satisfactory,\n            risk to development outcome was negligible to low, Bank\n            performance for PAL I was satisfactory while it was\n            moderately satisfactory for PAL II.  Three major categories\n            of lessons emerge from this assessment of the PAL program:\n            links and complementarity between the PAL program and\n            investment lending need reinforcing, politically difficult\n            issues are noticeable during the early stages of program\n            implementation and when crucial to the success of the\n            program should be addressed early and tranching was to fully\n            consistent with the PAL program approach (and brought no\n            obvious advantages)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - First Programmatic,

    achievements, in the five thematic areas of the first PAL\n            operation: fiscal and financial Discipline; regulatory\n            reform; creating and protecting property rights; public\n            sector accountability; and, management of social and\n            environmental risks. The project will encourage policy\n            coordination - PAL provides an anchor for the pro-reform\n            constituency in the Government and the Verkhovna Rada, it\n            acts as a catalyst for change, and it is able to direct\n            technical assistance to areas so requiring. Wider\n            participation of civil society in the design, and\n            implementation of reforms will be supported, as will the\n            continued macroeconomic stability, through the establishment\n            of structural reforms, crucial for growth over the medium\n            term. Additionally, improvement of the social situation will\n            be pursued to by reduce poverty by improving social\n            services, and providing more opportunities for middle, and\n            lower income households, so as to share in the benefits of\n            economic development, both in urban, and rural areas.\n            Consequently, the project will provide significant resources\n            to help finance the ongoing reform program. However,\n            political uncertainty, the pace of structural reform, and\n            vulnerability to as yet unforeseen external economic shocks,\n            are risks the project faces. Nevertheless, the flexibility\n            built into the PAL design will allow focusing on\n            opportunities, and help ensure the program's\n            sustainability, while in addition, experience has already\n            shown that institutional reforms tend to create demand for\n            other institutional reforms which may be lagging. The\n            continued relationship with the International Monetary Fund,\n            Bank support, and that of other donors, remains extremely\n            important for Ukraine's medium to long
