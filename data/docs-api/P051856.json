Lessons learned\n            include: it is vital to ensure that the project\n            implementation unit (PIU) be provided with adequate budget\n            and resources to carry out its responsibilities effectively.\n            The PIU was anchored in the Beijing National Accounting\n            Institute (BNAI). At the project outset, this made sense as\n            the PIU was responsible for financial management reporting,\n            procurement and monitoring only for the one training\n            institute and consolidating the information from the\n            accounting reform component. However, as the project\n            progressed and disbursements increased, two new NAIs were\n            established, the procurement and reporting responsibilities\n            increased significantly as a result. It is essential to have\n            the project structure flexible enough to adapt to changes in\n            the environment. In 2006, Ministry of Finance (MOF) issued\n            Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (ASBE). The\n            new accounting and auditing principles required several\n            courses to be adjusted accordingly. The importance of\n            project ownership and technical knowledge of the accounting\n            profession should not be underestimated. At the beginning of\n            the project, the most senior government counterparts had\n            fairly limited knowledge of the international accounting\n            profession. However, when leadership changed, and the\n            government put in place individuals with a more broad vision\n            of accounting, the project impact accelerated dramatically.\n            Project staff needs to be rewarded professionally for\n            responsibilities under the project. Throughout the project\n            the staff of the NAIs was directly involved in course\n            development and procurement of the related consulting\n            services. At times these activities proved complex and time\n            consuming and staff were often not rewarded for additional work."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Accounting Reform and Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Accounting Reform and\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/05/12485227/china-accounting-reform-development-project","projn":"CN-Accounting Reform & Development -- P051856","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Business Environment,Banks & Banking Reform,Labor Policies,Competitiveness and Competition Policy,Business in Development","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20100629004043"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account, accountancy, accountants,\n            ACCOUNTING, accounting consistency, accounting firms,\n            Accounting Policies, accounting practices, ACCOUNTING\n            REFORM, Accounting Standards, accounting systems, accounts,\n            Asset Management, auditing, auditing principles, auditing\n            standards, auditors, audits, banking system, banks,\n            bookkeeping, Borrowing, Borrowing Costs, Budgeting, business\n            administration, Business Combinations, business management,\n            capital flows, Cash Flow Statements, Certified Public\n            Accountants, commercial banks, cooperatives, cost\n            effectiveness, cost savings, data quality, Debt, Debt\n            Restructuring, Earnings per Share, economic growth, economic\n            reform, expenditures, financial institutions, financial\n            management, financial performance, Financial Reporting,\n            Financial Reporting Standards, Financial Reports, financial\n            statements, image, income, Income Taxes, institutional\n            development, Insurance, Intangible Assets, internal\n            controls, International Accounting Standards, job creation,\n            Key performance indicators, macroeconomic stability,\n            mandates, market economies, market economy, Outputs,\n            participatory processes, present value, procurement, public\n            enterprises, resource allocation, resources allocation,\n            Sales, social development, taxation, Technical Assistance"}},"owner":"Financial & Private Sector Dept.

The project comprises\n            two related components. The component supports the\n            continuing professional education of China's certified\n            public accountants, and other finance managers and\n            professionals, to familiarize them, on a large scale, with\n            new accounting, auditing, and business administration\n            principles and practices that are generally accepted in\n            market economics. The project helps establish a large\n            residential continuing education facility in Beijing, which\n            offers a wide selection of short courses on specific\n            accounting and business topics and issues. Bank assistance\n            focuses on providing educational and training equipment and\n            materials, designing the curricula, financing of high level\n            trainers who can help build local training capacity, and\n            providing overseas training for trainers. The second\n            component continues support for the government's\n            ongoing effort to develop and promulgate accounting\n            standards that conform to internationally accepted\n            accounting standards. Bank assistance comprises issuing and\n            disseminating standards, developing and publishing new\n            accounting standards and their dissemination to high-level\n            officials, monitoring the application of standards and\n            developing an on-line best practices service for users, and\n            developing a study tour and training program with supporting\n            equipment and training materials."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
