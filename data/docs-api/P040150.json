The following lessons are derived from the\n            project: (i) inadequate attention to local institutions and\n            their governance arrangements may jeopardize achievement of\n            urban development objectives. While it is tempting to think\n            of infrastructure projects as being focused on engineering,\n            the reality in Belize is that little of the infrastructure\n            will be able to function because sound institutions and good\n            governance are weak or absent; (ii) technical assistance in\n            the form of strategies and plans for infrastructure\n            investment may be ineffectual in the absence of government\n            ownership and a defined medium-term fiscal framework within\n            which to situate them. As this framework was missing in\n            Belize the technical assistance was effectively wasted;\n            (iii) simple engineering solutions can deliver substantial\n            development impacts even when there are adverse\n            institutional and political circumstances. In this project\n            the Burrell Boom Bridge greatly enhanced the capacity of\n            Belize's road infrastructure, particularly for disaster\n            management following hurricanes; (iv) drainage and roads are\n            component parts of town planning and cannot be planned\n            independently or randomly. Although strong and\n            well-coordinated planning institutions are prerequisites for\n            planning infrastructure investment for urban areas these\n            were not available in Belize; and (v) drainage systems\n            cannot be designed piecemeal. They have to be designed\n            within the context of a watershed, taking into account the\n            future plans for that watershed in terms of land use, and be\n            structured in such a way that they incrementally improve the\n            drainage. The lack of comprehensive planning and poor\n            sequencing of municipal drainage works in Belize\n            demonstrated that an ad hoc approach will not work."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Belize -

The\n            implementation of the Project has been successful, and it is\n            currently rated satisfactory. The works, and institutional\n            strengthening activities financed by the Project, are either\n            under way, or have been completed. However, with respect to\n            the Road Maintenance Pilot Project Component, whose\n            objective was to assess the possibility of increasing the\n            participation of the private sector in road maintenance\n            activities, the Government requested that it be cancelled,\n            and that the Loan proceeds allocated to this component (USD\n            650,000) be used to finance additional drainage works, and\n            the corresponding consultant services in the municipalities\n            of Orange Walk and Corozal. The requested cancellation was\n            based on a decision of the Government to include, in a loan\n            financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), a\n            pilot project with essentially the same characteristics, and\n            objectives as the one included under this project. The\n            report documenting the results of the IDB-financed work was\n            reviewed by the Bank, stating it meets satisfactorily the\n            project objectives as envisaged by this project, and, that\n            the proposed reallocation of resources would improve the\n            drainage needs of the two municipalities. The amendment\n            reflects this change, and includes the revised Schedule 1 to\n            the Loan Agreement, showing the reallocation of the Loan\n            proceeds, and, will reflect the extension to the\n            Project's Closing Date granted on February 5,2004."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Belize -

roads, and water drainage\n            in six towns in Belize. During the first phase of\n            construction, most of the adverse impacts will be associated\n            to noise, dust, accessibility, traffic disruption, including\n            potentially high adverse impacts on archaeological sites. In\n            addition, during the second, and third phases of\n            construction, adverse impacts on critical habitats will\n            occur. The Environmental Assessment (EA) presents\n            recommendations for mitigation measures to reduce adversity,\n            and ensure adequate environmental practices. Measures for\n            the first phase of construction suggest the establishment of\n            alternate routes, noise abatement, and careful drainage\n            design planning, in accordance with established construction\n            practices, and, during excavation, and construction,\n            archaeological sites should be specifically monitored for\n            preservation purposes. The provision of training to the Town\n            Boards' staff in planning, and maintenance, is\n            recommended, as well as small-scale assistance in urban, and\n            land-use planning. Monitoring of the effects of dredging on\n            the beaches is highly recommended, to protect coastal\n            stability.

In\n            addition, during the second, and third phases of\n            construction, adverse impacts on critical habitats will\n            occur.
