The proposed Bank loan would finance a\n            part of the three-year time slice FY82-84 of EGAT's\n            expenditures and commitments for expenditures for the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Power Subsector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Power Subsector Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/04/726175/thailand-power-subsector-project","projn":"TH-Power Sub-Sector -- P004719","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Poverty Alleviation,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912514310"},"subsc":"(Historic)Thermal","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access to Electricity,bulk power,bulk\n            supply,charcoal,Coal,commercial\n            energy,Construction,cooking,costs of power,dam\n            safety,Design,diesel engines,diesel fuel,distribution\n            entities,Distribution losses,drilling,efficient\n            use,elasticity,electric energy,electric\n            power,Electricity,electricity consumption,Electricity\n            Generating Authority,electricity sector,electricity\n            supply,electrification programs,energy charges,Energy\n            Conservation,Energy conservation measures,Energy\n            Consumption,energy ministry,energy output,energy\n            policy,Energy Pricing,Energy Resources,energy sector,energy\n            sector review,energy\n            sources,Engineering,Engineering,Environmental\n            Aspects,ethanol,forms of energy,fuel,fuel oil,fuel\n            prices,gas fields,gas reserves,Gas turbine,gas\n            turbines,grid,heat,Income,Insurance,kerosene,lighting,lignite,lignite\n            production,mini-hydro,Natural Gas,natural gas\n            pricing,natural resources,Oil,oil equivalent,oil price,oil\n            prices,oil shale,peak demand,Petroleum,Petroleum\n            products,pipeline,pipeline system,power generation,power\n            plants,power projects,POWER SECTOR,power stations,power\n            supply,price of gas,primary energy,Provision of\n            power,residential consumers,rivers,Rural\n            Electrification,rural electrification program,shale\n            oil,state-owned utilities,structures,thermal plants,Thermal\n            Power,thermal power stations,total electricity\n            consumption,Total energy consumption,use of gas,utilities,wood"},"1":{"cdata!":"Access to Electricity,bulk power,bulk\n            supply,charcoal,Coal,commercial\n            energy,Construction,cooking,costs of power,dam\n            safety,Design,diesel engines,diesel fuel,distribution\n            entities,Distribution losses,drilling,efficient\n            use,elasticity,electric energy,electric\n            power,Electricity,electricity consumption,Electricity\n            Generating Authority,electricity sector,electricity\n            supply,electrification programs,energy charges,Energy\n            Conservation,Energy conservation measures,Energy\n            Consumption,energy ministry,energy output,energy\n            policy,Energy Pricing,Energy Resources,energy sector,energy\n            sector review,energy\n            sources,Engineering,Engineering,Environmental\n            Aspects,ethanol,forms of energy,fuel,fuel oil,fuel\n            prices,gas fields,gas reserves,Gas turbine,gas\n            turbines,grid,heat,Income,Insurance,kerosene,lighting,lignite,lignite\n            production,mini-hydro,Natural Gas,natural gas\n            pricing,natural resources,Oil,oil equivalent,oil price,oil\n            prices,oil shale,peak demand,Petroleum,Petroleum\n            products,pipeline,pipeline system,power generation,power\n            plants,power projects,POWER SECTOR,power stations,power\n            supply,price of gas,primary energy,Provision of\n            power,residential consumers,rivers,Rural\n            Electrification,rural electrification program,shale\n            oil,state-owned utilities,structures,thermal plants,Thermal\n            Power,thermal power stations,total electricity\n            consumption,Total energy consumption,use of gas,utilities,wood"}},"owner":"Southeast Asia Headquarters Unit (EACSQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"3158"},"facets":{}}}
