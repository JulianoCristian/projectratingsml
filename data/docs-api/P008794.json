The lessons learned indicate that\n            restructuring the power sector is a time-consuming process.\n            Romanian Energy Regulatory Agency's (ANRE's)\n            evolution into a well functioning regulatory agency was very\n            instrumental in supporting the reform of the sector.\n            ANRE's staff, who are of high caliber and well\n            respected in the profession, helped develop the broader\n            consensus for resolving many sectoral issues, especially on\n            tariffs. European union (EU) accession goal provided\n            significant momentum to reforms in the power sector, and\n            when the Bank's sector assistance to create the\n            enabling framework is combined with macro and policy reforms\n            supported by the Bank and/or IMF, the synergy can ensure\n            better and timely results.
