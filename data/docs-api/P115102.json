Some lessons learned included:\n            policy reforms are implemented and therefore driven by the\n            middle level government officials across the range of\n            ministries. Reforms should therefore incorporate the\n            tactical and political sense of these key government\n            counterparts when designing the pace and scope of a program.\n            Where consensus is uncertain, a deliberation process along\n            with modest expectations should be established up front to\n            allow policy options to be explored and breakthroughs to\n            emerge. To support such a process, constant dialogue between\n            the Government and the Bank is fundamental and is best\n            facilitated by a strong field presence across a wide range\n            of sectors which views policy discussions as a natural part\n            of ongoing support. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            system for IDPL lacked in places, quantitative indicators,\n            baseline data, strong targets and a system for monitoring\n            and recalibration of variables. For the system to be a\n            useful management tool for Government, it is important for\n            outcomes to be monitored and attributed to design and\n            implementation issues, so that the latter can receive\n            attention. For this to occur, integration of the M&E\n            framework with the results framework is needed so: (i)\n            objectives are explicitly stated, (ii) associated outcomes\n            are targeted with numerical indicators, (iii) policy actions\n            are specified which will credibly influence the targeted\n            indicators, and (iv) on-going calibration of policy changes,\n            external changes and targeted indicators are carried out as\n            part of Government functions to support implementation of a\n            multi-year, multi-sector program of the complexity of the\n            IDPL series."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - First, Second, Third, and Fourth\n            Infrastructure Development Policy Loans

Development\n            Policy Loan Program for Indonesia is intended to: (i)\n            increase the quantity and efficiency of central Government\n            spending on infrastructure through improved public service\n            obligation (subsidy) policy, and expenditure planning and\n            budgeting; (ii) improve sub-national infrastructure services\n            through increased sub-national government spending and an\n            improved incentives framework; (iii)in crease private\n            investment in infrastructure through the establishment of a\n            fiscally sound, credible and transparent Public-Private\n            Partnership (PPP) framework; and (iv) enhance governance for\n            infrastructure through improved land acquisition,\n            environmental protection, and procurement and audit\n            processes within the Ministry of Public Works. The current\n            operation focuses on the most important infrastructure\n            reform achievements of 2009,'prior actions' which\n            are critical for the objectives of the program: 1) the\n            Government is developing a scheme of output-based grants to\n            sub-national governments when evidence is provided of new\n            working piped water connections for poor households; 2) the\n            level of infrastructure investment by key Government\n            ministries has been substantially increased, providing an\n            important foundation for higher economic growth; 3) the\n            Government has prepared revisions to Perpres 67, the law\n            which governs infrastructure PPPs, extending its operation\n            to PPPs of sub-national governments; 4) the Government i s\n            improving the accuracy and transparency of electricity\n            subsidy forecasts, providing greater impetus towards\n            ultimately reducing the subsidy; 5) the Government is\n            establishing new institutions to improve the availability of\n            long-term financing for infrastructure PPPs; 6) recent legal\n            reforms are now facilitating land acquisition for\n            infrastructure projects; and 7) the Ministry of Public Works\n            Director General of Highways (Bina Marga) has established an\n            internal taskforce to provide advice and assistance to the\n            procurement committees that are responsible for individual\n            procurement
