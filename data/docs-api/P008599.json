Both the\n            Bank, and Borrower performances were satisfactory, allowing\n            high institutional development impacts. Nonetheless, project\n            experiences reinforce the following lessons. The competency\n            demonstrated by counterparts, was the result of highly\n            trained staff, who benefited from additional financial\n            resources, and exposure to new technical, and managerial\n            methods. However, it is emphasized that: a) road\n            administrations should plan the use of resources, based on\n            an economic analysis that identifies optimal choices for\n            road improvements, through established computer programs; b)\n            contracting should be on a competitive basis, to decrease\n            costs, and improve efficiency; c) expropriation issues\n            should be conducted prior to civil works, to avoid\n            unexpected implementation delays; and, likewise,\n            environmental assessments' endorsements should be\n            carefully issued to avoid costly work disruptions; and, d)\n            contractor performance should undergo strong supervision,\n            ensuring that payments are tied to fulfilling quality\n            requirements. Furthermore, the design, and implementation of\n            a road safety policy requires increased awareness of traffic\n            safety issues, as well as strong ownership, coordination,\n            and adequate funding.
