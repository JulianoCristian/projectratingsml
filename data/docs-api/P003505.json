The project outcome is rated as highly\n            satisfactory. The objectives of the project were consistent\n            with those of the Chinese Government and the Bank. The\n            project achieved its major objectives and the beneficiary\n            has shown a strong sense of ownership. Key lessons can be\n            summarized as follows: (a) A very careful analysis of the\n            expected coal quality is of paramount importance; (b) Design\n            and procurement of auxiliary equipment should be given the\n            same attention as for major equipment. (c) The firefighting\n            system should not be designed and procured on an island-by\n            island basis; (d) Procurement packages should be determined\n            such that excessive interfacing will be avoided; (e)\n            Accounting standards should be brought in line with\n            international standards. (f) Most provinces of China have\n            seen a substantial increase in generation capacity over the\n            recent years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Yanshi Thermal Power

Yanshi thermal power plant by\n            adding two generating units of 300 MW each at a site being\n            developed; (ii) construction of five 220 kV transmission\n            lines with associated substations; (iii) provision of\n            technical assistance for a tariff study for the Henan power\n            grid; and (iv) a training program for upgrading the\n            technical, financial, and management skills of the Henan\n            Provincial Electric Power Bureau (HPEPB) staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Yanshi Thermal Power
