The\n            most fundamental lesson learned is that private sector\n            investment projects - including enclave undertakings such as\n            the Industrial Free Zone (IFZs) -- cannot develop to their\n            full potential in the absence of sound sector policies.\n            Private investors in this Project suffered -- and will\n            continue to suffer -- because of the underdeveloped state of\n            the local financial system, and the reliance on a poorly\n            capitalized banking system to finance \"lumpy\",\n            capital-intensive investments. Indeed, a broader set of\n            debt, quasi-equity, and equity instruments may be required\n            for the optimal financing of such projects. Moreover,\n            notwithstanding the successes of the IFZ model to date, the\n            potential for using IFZ growth to support more widespread\n            productive development continues unrealized because\n            industrial sector policies constrain the integration of\n            domestic factors into the export sector. As a result,\n            industrial and service sector employment (including\n            employment for the poor) and national export earnings are\n            lower than they could be. The need for financial and\n            industrial sector reform has become even more urgent with\n            the advent of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\n            and increased global competition for IFZ investment based\n            upon low-cost labor. These developments imply that the\n            continued success of the IFZs in the Dominican Republic will\n            be contingent upon successful measures to raise value added\n            in the production chain, inter alia through worker education\n            and training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic -
