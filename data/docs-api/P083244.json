This\n            objective will be achieved by strengthening the\n            communities' local capacity to build sustainable\n            organizations, development projects and cultural identity.\n            To this end, the project will actively promote interaction\n            between the ethnic communities, local governments and\n            central government agencies and programs. During the\n            three-year project, Nuestras Raices will seek to strengthen\n            the participation and influence of Honduras' ethnic\n            groups in local development processes. The project has three\n            components. Component 1 supports a process of participatory\n            development planning among the indigenous and Afro-Honduran\n            communities and the federations in order to: (a) train and\n            prepare ethnic communities and their ethnic representations\n            to actively participate in the local development planning\n            process; (b) identify subprojects to be financed under\n            Nuestras Raices and other programs; and (c) encourage ethnic\n            federations to work more closely with municipalities to\n            leverage funds. Component 2 allocates grants for\n            subprojects. Component 3  finances capacity building of\n            ethnic communities to lead their own development process,\n            institutional strengthening of the Nuestras Raices team,\n            located within al Fondo Hondureno de Inversion Social\n            (FHIS), and monitoring and evaluation. The main capacity\n            building activities include training and technical\n            assistance to the communities in participatory development\n            planning, project identification,
