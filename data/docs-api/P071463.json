Subsequent debt\n            rescheduling and improvements in macro management have also\n            reduced the threat of default. Even though debt service\n            levels remain high, sustainability of these net benefits is\n            rated likely. Institutional development is negligible.\n            Overall, both Bank and Borrower performance are rated\n            unsatisfactory.  SAL's outcome is rated as moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Improvements in loan repayment have been\n            sustained and are likely to continue. Even though debt\n            service levels remain high, sustainability of these net\n            benefits is rated likely. Institutional reform was\n            negligible. Because of the failure to implement the reform\n            program, Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory. The\n            problems with SAL reflect a lack of broad-based commitment\n            in Pakistan, not the program design; Bank performance is\n            rated satisfactory.  Overall, outcome of SAC I is rated\n            satisfactory, and sustainability of project achievements is\n            likely. Overall institutional development impact is rated\n            modest. Performance o f both the Bank and the Borrower are\n            rated satisfactory. The overall outcome of SAC II is rated\n            as moderately satisfactory, and sustainability of net\n            project benefits is rated likely. SAC II had important\n            institutional objectives in tax administration, public\n            financial management, civil service reform, procurement, and\n            utility restructuring and regulation. Overall institutional\n            development impact is rated modest. Both Bank and Borrower\n            performance are rated satisfactory.  The main lessons from\n            these loans are: 1) Effectiveness of a series of one-tranche\n            loans depends on a willingness to withhold lending until a\n            critical mass of previously-agreed prior actions have been\n            undertaken. The delay between the SAL and the first SAC was\n            particularly effective in this respect.2) Complex or\n            politically difficult sector reforms are best supported\n            through dedicated sector operations. A multi-sector\n            operation can play only a secondary or facilitating role\n            when dealing with institutional development (as in tax\n            reform or civil service reform), deep-rooted reluctance to\n            reform (as in power), need for specific funding to offset\n            costs of adjustment (as in banking), or weak service\n            delivery (as in health and education)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Public Sector Adjustment\n            Loan/Credit Project (PSAL), Structural Adjustment Loan\n            Project (SAL), and the First and Second Structural\n            Adjustment Credit (SAC I and SAC II) Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Public Sector\n            Adjustment Loan/Credit Project (PSAL), Structural Adjustment\n            Loan Project (SAL), and the First and Second Structural\n            Adjustment Credit (SAC I and SAC II) Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/12/6500732/pakistan-public-sector-adjustment-loancredit-project-psal-structural-adjustment-loan-project-sal-first-second-structural-adjustment-credit-sac-sac-ii-projects","projn":"PK-Structural Adjustment Credit II -- P074968,PK-Public Sector Adjust -- P010447,PK-Pakistan-Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln.\n            4435) -- P090474,PK-Structural Adjustment Credit -- P071463","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Country Strategy & Performance,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Public Sector Economics,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20051228094447"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Power,Oil and gas,Primary education,Health,General energy sector,Banking,Petrochemicals and fertilizers,Other social services,Irrigation and drainage,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA,Project Evaluations","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Energy and mining,Finance,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB, adjustment loans, Auditing, Banking\n            Sector, banking system, borrower, borrowing, civil service,\n            commitment, conditionality, Consumer Price Index, cost of\n            capital, creditworthiness, debt, debt management, debt\n            service, deficit spending, deregulation, devaluation,\n            Development Finance, Economic Cooperation, economic growth,\n            economic recovery, economic reform, employment, Enhanced\n            Structural Adjustment Facility, exports, Extended Fund\n            Facility, Financial Institutions, financial management,\n            fiscal deficits, fiscal management, fiscal reform, foreign\n            exchange, foreign exchange reserves, GDP, Gross Domestic\n            Product, growth rate, Institutional Development, interest\n            payments, interest rates, lending operations, LOAN,\n            LOAN/CREDIT, London Club, macroeconomic policies,\n            macroeconomic stability, natural resources, opportunity\n            cost, peer review, price increases, price setting, private\n            sector, Privatization, PUBLIC, public expenditure, public\n            finance, PUBLIC SECTOR, public sector management, Public\n            Service, public spending, resource mobilization, revenue\n            collection, SAL, Second tranche release, social services,\n            STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT, surcharges, takeover, Tax, tax\n            administration, tax collection, tax reform, taxation, trade\n            liberalization, Tranche, transparency"}},"owner":"Econ.

Despite being too early\n            to draw firm lessons on the project's operation, and\n            strategy, some tentative lessons convey experiences to\n            consider, as follows. The approach of using a one-tranche\n            operation, has seemingly worked, particularly as it relates\n            to the operation within the context of the Country\n            Assistance Strategy (CAS). Likewise, the strategic approach,\n            seems particularly suited for a government, where its\n            ability to implement a reform program, needs a further\n            confident reestablishment, and, this in turn suggests that\n            it might be useful to conduct an Intensive Learning\n            Implementation Completion Report, following the next one, or\n            two one-tranche adjustment operations. Nonetheless, it will\n            be important to maintain a medium-to-long term focus on the\n            actions supported, if such one-tranche operations are to be\n            implemented in the context of the CAS, so as to ensure a\n            timely start on measures requiring a longer lead time.\n            Similarly, implementation of actions already taken, should\n            be ensured, to sustain the effective momentum of their\n            intended outcomes. However, it is important to review the\n            government's bold devolution program, since both\n            opportunities, and risks have been identified: opportunities\n            include a greater voice for the country's people;\n            conversely, risks include a potential disconnect between\n            national, and local priorities, particularly where\n            traditional elites have not fully appreciated the benefits\n            of social actions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

However, several risks exist, namely,\n            Pakistan's debt situation; political changes as of\n            October 2002, which may hinder reforms; and, fiduciary, and\n            implementation risks associated to devolution. Thus, risk\n            management will require strong reform implementation to\n            facilitate domestic adjustment, market responses, and\n            external support; the establishment of institutional\n            mechanisms for policy continuity, such as the elected\n            district governments; and, a phased approach in devolving\n            the responsibilities of civil
