One of the main lessons learned from the loan\n            is that a key element for the success of any major\n            adjustment program is strong ownership on the part of the\n            government. In this regard, the program of reform should\n            build strongly on the Policy Framework agreed with the\n            government. Strong ownership ensures strong commitment to\n            the reform and minimizes the risk of reversal, particularly\n            in the face of politically unpopular reforms. Another key\n            lesson learned is that the Bank should appraise carefully\n            not only a Government's commitment to a reform program,\n            but also its institutional capacity to implement it. This\n            will assist the Bank and borrowers to identify weaknesses\n            early on and facilitate either the prerequisite or companion\n            technical assistance to build implementation capacity. In\n            particular, the Bank should assess very carefully the scope\n            of actions to be carried out under a project to establish a\n            realistic time-frame for the completion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Private Sector Development\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica - Private Sector\n            Development

Macroeconomic policies will\n            primarily focus on strengthening fiscal adjustment.  Trade\n            reform will reduce tariff protection in stages in accordance\n            with the recently agreed Caribbean Community Common External\n            Tariff, increasing international competitiveness and\n            efficiency of enterprises.  The privatization program, which\n            cuts across many sectors, will open new activities for the\n            private sector, shift the government's role from\n            commercial and industrial activities to the social sectors\n            and reduce the fiscal burden of inefficient public\n            enterprises.  Complementary legal, regulatory and\n            administrative reforms will improve the business environment\n            to accelerate output and export response. The loan will\n            finance general imports, subject to certain restrictions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Private Sector Development\n            Adjustment Loan
