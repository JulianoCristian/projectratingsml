For the Health and\n            Population Program Project (HPPP) it differed in the rating\n            of modest institutional development impact and an\n            unsatisfactory performance of the Bank.

Lessons learned include the\n            following: aid-financed health infrastructure can work in\n            improving health outcomes provided other conditions are in\n            place; public and private provision are complements not\n            substitutes; a sector wide approach (SWAP) takes time to\n            implement and is an evolutionary process; wide stakeholder\n            participation in preparation helps ownership but can weaken\n            design; think through the implications of the new system;\n            draw on the appropriate skills mix; failure to assess fully\n            the political economy of reform and to prepare both a\n            proactive plan for addressing/mitigating risks and a\n            contingency plan will considerably diminish prospects for\n            successful reform; too much donor/Bank intervention can\n            undermine government capacity and ownership of a SWAP\n            approach; and finally, be realistic in tackling major reform objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -  Fourth Population & Health\n            and Health & Population Program Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh -  Fourth Population\n            & Health and Health & Population Program Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/6933304/bangladesh-fourth-population-health-health-population-program-projects","projn":"BD-Pop. & Health IV -- P009529,BD-Health And Population Program Project -- P037857","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Population Policies,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Health, Nutrition and Population,Rural Development","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000112742_20060719100629"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Health,General education sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Health, Nutrition and Population,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"behaviour change, child health, child health\n            care, Child Welfare, clinics, Community Participation,\n            contraceptive prevalence, contraceptive supplies,\n            contraceptives, cost effectiveness, decentralization,\n            decline in fertility, development objectives, disability,\n            disease control, diseases, Dispensaries, dissemination,\n            Economics, Emergency Obstetric Care, Epidemiological\n            Surveillance, Essential Services Package, Family Health,\n            Family Planning, family planning service, family planning\n            services, Family Welfare, fertility, fertility decline,\n            fertility rate, Fertility Survey, FWA, Health, Health Care,\n            Health Economics, health facilities, health infrastructure,\n            health outcomes, health programs, health reform, health\n            sector, health services, Health Training, hospital, hospital\n            autonomy, hospital services, Hospitals, immunization,\n            infant, infant mortality, Information System, Information\n            Systems, integration, intervention, leprosy, live births,\n            Marketing, Mass Media, maternal care, Maternal Health,\n            Medical Education, Medical Research, medicines, minority,\n            morbidity, mortality, Mother, National Drug, national level,\n            natural resources, Neonatal Health, NGOs, Nursing,\n            Nutrition, Nutrition Programs, nutritional status,\n            occupational health, participatory process, poor women,\n            Population, population density, population growth,\n            Population Research, Population Sector, Population Sector\n            Strategy, Poverty Reduction, Poverty Reduction Strategy,\n            primary care, Private Sector, progress, Public Health,\n            public health services, Quality Assurance, reducing maternal\n            mortality, rehabilitation, reproductive health, reproductive\n            health care, School Health, service delivery, service\n            provision, social sector, Technical assistance, Training\n            Centers, Tuberculosis, UNFPA, unions, urban areas,\n            vulnerable groups, workers"}},"owner":"S.A.

Key\n            lessons learned are: 1) Although long-term commitment to the\n            sector on the part of International Development Association\n            (IDA) and other development partners will continue to be\n            essential to the progress of the sector, the project did not\n            effectively address program sustainability or the reduction\n            of continued dependence on external financing. 2) The\n            IDA-led donor consortium largely achieved its aid\n            coordination objectives, thereby reducing Ministry of Health\n            and Family Welfare's management burden in terms of\n            donor relations and facilitating relatively flexible\n            financing arrangements. 3) The projectized approach to the\n            utilization of donor resources was inefficient in a variety\n            of ways and undermined the Ministry's ability to manage\n            its program. 4) The delivery of health and family welfare\n            services through separate Directorates continued to be\n            inefficient and in important respects limited effectiveness.\n            5) Despite extremely limited public resources, pressures on\n            Government to fund expensive tertiary facilities and\n            curative care proved difficult to resist. A public sector\n            focus on priority funding for the most cost-effective basic\n            services is needed. 6) The successful delivery of services\n            by nongovernmental organizations in cooperation with\n            Government suggests that this approach could usefully be expanded."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
