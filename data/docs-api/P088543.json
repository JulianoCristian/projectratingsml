Some\n            lessons learned included: strong client ownership of the\n            reform program was critical in its effective design and\n            implementation. The Government took a proactive role in\n            defining the policy matrix with measures that were both high\n            impact and feasible within the time frame of the operation.\n            Furthermore, the State Government strongly supported the\n            two-tranche design, as opposed to a single-tranche design,\n            clearly cognizant of the implication that the release of the\n            second tranche would be conditional on their fulfilling the\n            agreed conditions. Strong leadership at the highest levels\n            of Government was also important for significant fiscal\n            adjustment and deep public sector reforms to succeed. As\n            attested to by a track record of over five full years in\n            government, the Government of Minas Gerais benefits from the\n            necessary strength of leadership throughout the higher\n            levels of government. The Governor was dedicated to the\n            reform proposals, but also built around him a qualified and\n            dedicated team to assure success of the program. This\n            leadership was critical to the success of the project. The\n            project emphasized fiscal adjustment, innovation in public\n            sector management and private sector development. The\n            emphasis given to fiscal adjustment was a key because it\n            provided an impetus for finding better ways of doing things\n            in both the private and public sectors. These new approaches\n            assisted with reducing costs, thus contributing to the\n            fiscal adjustment. A virtuous circle was created whereby the\n            set of reforms, although each very difficult, contributed to\n            increasing growth, poverty reduction and an economic\n            turn-around that improved the fiscal situation, growth and\n            conditions for the citizens of Minas Gerais."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Minas Gerais Partnership for\n            Development
