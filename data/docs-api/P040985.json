The first\n            project, begun in 1996, channeled funds an innovative\n            quasi-government poverty foundation that lends to promising\n            small and medium non-government organizations (NGOs) to\n            expand microcredit programs. It helped reduce poverty by\n            stabilizing income and consumption as well as by increasing\n            access to clean water and better health. The project also\n            increased school enrollment rates and boosted family assets.\n            In addition, by supporting partner-NGOs that retail\n            microcredit, it enabled them to seek part of their funding\n            needs from the financial market, and allowing their gradual\n            integration into the formal financial sector. Inspired by\n            this success, the World Bank approved the second poverty\n            alleviation micro-finance project in January 2001. The\n            Bank-sponsored project alone is projected to reach an\n            estimated 1.2 million new borrowers and support 19,500 micro-entrepreneurs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Empowering poor through microcredit"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Empowering poor\n            through microcredit"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/07/23826763/bangladesh-empowering-poor-through-microcredit","count":"Bangladesh","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"assets, clean water, credits, employment,\n            entrepreneurs, expansion, financial market, formal financial\n            sector, income, micro-credit, Micro-finance, Micro-finance\n            project, Microcredit, microcredit programs, Poverty\n            Alleviation, self-employment, small loans"}},"majtheme":"Financial and private sector development","projn":"BD-Poverty Alleviation Microfinance -- P040985","topic":"Microfinance m1327227 367,Employability, Skills and Jobs m1327054 2131,Income-Generating Activities m1327205 1611,Micro-Credit m1327228 1764,Micro-enterprises m1327657 1169","subtopic":"Microfinance,Debt Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Rural Poverty Reduction,Emerging Markets","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Private Sector Development,Poverty Reduction","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150119132519"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"General industry and trade sector,Micro- and SME finance","theme":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Private Sector Development,Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Microfinance m1327227 367,Employability, Skills and Jobs m1327054 2131,Income-Generating Activities m1327205 1611,Micro-Credit m1327228 1764,Micro-enterprises m1327657 1169","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C"],"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"91748"},"1346444":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2001/06/1346444/bangladesh-poverty-alleviation-microfinance-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2001/06/1346444/bangladesh-poverty-alleviation-microfinance-project","new_url":"2001/06/1346444/bangladesh-poverty-alleviation-microfinance-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/07/13/000094946_01070404141144/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/07/13/000094946_01070404141144/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","credit_no":"2922","datestored":"2001-07-13T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2001-06-15T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Poverty Alleviation\n            Microfinance Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The outcome of the Poverty Alleviation\n            Microfinance Project is rated as satisfactory.

Intensive supervision and monitoring\n            of POs by skilled staff of APEX institutions such as Palli\n            Karma Sahayak Foundation(PKSF) with sensitivity to clients\n            is essential for maintaining portfolio quality.

A \"business\n            plan\" showing its strategic goals, expansion plans,\n            institutional development needs, and measures to attain\n            them, is a useful management tool for apex institutions and\n            its POs.

Review of\n            the POs' interest rate policy to absorb the cost of\n            funds and to raise capital in financial markets is essential\n            to achieve sustainability. A human resource development\n            (HRD) policy for apex institutions and POs is required to\n            promote staff motivation and ensure their career paths for\n            efficiency and
