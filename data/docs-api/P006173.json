Some of the key lessons include: 1)\n            Ownership and commitment are essential for the success of a\n            reform program. 2) The feedback of a public information\n            campaign needs to be included in the design of the program.\n            3) The sustainability of the reform is greatly enhanced by\n            putting emphasis on the transparency of the transactions and\n            by putting in place a worker's share program that\n            provides a strong constituency for the reform. 4)\n            Privatization through capitalization provides a good\n            alternative in scenarios where direct privatization is not\n            feasible or costly in terms of process or political capital.\n            5) In privatization programs, the focus tends to be on the\n            efficiency effects of reform. But the programs also have\n            important distributional effects. 6) Adjustment operations\n            are best designed to end well before elections are due. 7)\n            Although adjustment operations are normally designed to be\n            fully implemented by a single administration, the leverage\n            afforded by such an operation can be put to good use during\n            a change of government. 8) It is optimal to have not only\n            laws but also regulations and regulators in place before\n            proceeding with divestiture transactions. 9) In pension\n            reform a more radical approach to reform is not necessarily\n            more costly than a gradualist approach. 10) Pension reform\n            will take longer than planned. 11) Technical assistance\n            through parallel but separate credits allows more flexibility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Capitalization Program Adjustment\n            Credit
