Some\n            lessons learned includes: The flexibility of the Project\n            design was especially critical-for it allowed IABIN to adapt\n            to the rapidly changing information technology over the last\n            decade. The governance of regional projects has inherent\n            challenges. Therefore, institutional roles and\n            responsibilities of such Project which involves multiple\n            institutions in multiple countries should be clearly laid\n            out and understood by all the key players prior to project\n            effectiveness. Country ownership is critical to success.\n            Building the IABIN was an ambitious undertaking, relying on\n            the commitment of 34 governments and the involvement of\n            numerous institutions across the region. Emphasis on\n            capacity building helps sustainability. Clarification of\n            appropriate implementation arrangements for activities can\n            help identify possible incompatibilities in fiduciary\n            processes among agencies.

To support the development of IABIN, this\n            Global Environment Facility (GEF) project seeks to develop\n            an Internet-based, decentralized network that provides wider\n            access to scientifically credible, biodiversity information\n            currently existing in individual institutions, and agencies\n            in the Americas, provide tools to draw knowledge from that\n            wealth of resources, and in turn support sound\n            decision-making concerning the conservation, and sustainable\n            use of biodiversity. The project components will: 1) create\n            the information infrastructure necessary to search, and\n            access biodiversity data and information. To this end, IABIN\n            will seek to develop a regional consensus on standards, and,\n            promote interagency operations with other regional and\n            global efforts, especially the Global Biodiversity\n            Information Facility (GBIF). Under this component, the\n            project will seek agreement on the use of standards and\n            protocols to ensure compatibility of diverse data sources\n            within the region. Areas requiring consensus on standards\n            include: communications, taxonomic information, metadata,\n            controlled vocabularies, other authorities, and record\n            structures; 2) develop a formal Content Development Program,\n            so as to support multilingual training, and provide\n            technical leadership to IABIN countries, as they develop\n            critical data and metadata; 3) improve connectivity between\n            biological, and non-biological data, useful to\n            decision-makers in the public and private sectors. The\n            integration of natural, and social science data and\n            information is increasingly recognized as vital to\n            scientific research and societal decision making; 4) provide\n            financial sustainability, but first, sources of recurring\n            funding for the operation of the Secretariat and other\n            periodic activities must be identified. Second,\n            participating agencies and institutions must be assured of\n            continued internal funding for IABIN-related activities that\n            are their in-kind contributions to the development of the\n            project. GEF funds will facilitate the fund-seeking process\n            by identifying potential funding sources, and partners to\n            leverage available resources; and, 5) cover the\n            administrative costs of the Executing Agency, i.e.,\n            contracting, procurement, disbursements, audits, and,\n            monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and the Caribbean -\n            Organization of American States (OAS) :  Building the\n            Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network (IABIN) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Latin America and the Caribbean -\n            Organization of American States (OAS) :  Building the\n            Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network (IABIN) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4238509/latin-america-caribbean-organization-american-states-oas-building-inter-american-biodiversity-information-network-iabin-project","projn":"6L-Building The Inter-American Biodiversity\n            Information Network (I -- P077187","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Health Economics & Finance,Information and Records Management,ICT Policy and Strategies","count":"Latin America","entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040614142347"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Information technology","lang":"English","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Information and communications","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ABBREVIATIONS,access to\n            information,ACRONYMS,Articles,auditing,audits,biodiversity\n            community,Biological Diversity,content creation,Cost\n            Analysis,Data Providers,data sharing,decision\n            makers,decision\n            making,decision-making,Description,disasters,Environmental\n            Information,environmental issues,Exchange\n            Rate,Expenditures,forestry,information\n            infrastructure,information needs,Information\n            Sharing,Information Systems,information users,Knowledge\n            networks,Partner Organizations,partnership,policy\n            decisions,poverty alleviation,private\n            sector,Programs,protocols,research agenda,scientific\n            community,scientific cooperation,Sustainable\n            Development,Sustainable Management,sustainable\n            use,taxation,technical assistance,usability,use of information,users,Wetlands"},"1":{"cdata!":"ABBREVIATIONS,access to\n            information,ACRONYMS,Articles,auditing,audits,biodiversity\n            community,Biological Diversity,content creation,Cost\n            Analysis,Data Providers,data sharing,decision\n            makers,decision\n            making,decision-making,Description,disasters,Environmental\n            Information,environmental issues,Exchange\n            Rate,Expenditures,forestry,information\n            infrastructure,information needs,Information\n            Sharing,Information Systems,information users,Knowledge\n            networks,Partner Organizations,partnership,policy\n            decisions,poverty alleviation,private\n            sector,Programs,protocols,research agenda,scientific\n            community,scientific cooperation,Sustainable\n            Development,Sustainable Management,sustainable\n            use,taxation,technical assistance,usability,use of information,users,Wetlands"}},"owner":"Environment (LCSEN)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF030486-JAPAN CTF -
