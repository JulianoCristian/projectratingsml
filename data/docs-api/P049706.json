Some lessons learned includes: World Bank\n            Montreal Protocol (MP) operations has followed the phased\n            reductions of various groups of Ozone Depleting Substances\n            (ODS) per the MP and in accordance with Multilateral Fund\n            for the Implementation of the MP (MLF) policy and as such\n            required an extensive period of time to eliminate relevant\n            ODS while putting into place institutional arrangements and\n            regulatory measures to control and monitor ODS use and\n            elimination in relevant sectors. Active national involvement\n            at the related international forums proved an important\n            success factor. The special features of MP operations, which\n            work with specific industries while contributing to global\n            environmental benefits, often strand MP projects without a\n            clear sectoral home and commensurate management priority.\n            Given the very specialized skills needed for this type of\n            operation, it is necessary to cultivate appropriate national\n            and/or regional consultant skills for repeated use. The\n            safeguards review process for the World Bank Group is\n            expected to will align Bank safeguard policies with\n            International Finance Corporation (IFC) performance\n            standards, which will subsequently strengthen Bank Group\n            safeguards design and supervision with respect to worker\n            health and safety as well as working with private industries\n            as beneficiaries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Second Phase of the Ozone-Depleting\n            Substances
