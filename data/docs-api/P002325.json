teacher effectiveness as well as the relevancy and\n            availability of textbooks.  To achieve these objectives, the\n            project involves several components.  They include such\n            items as rehabilitating and construction of classrooms,\n            teacher training, curriculum development, improved resource\n            management, textbook production and the increase and\n            redeployment of primary school teachers into the classrooms.\n            The operation would improve access to primary education\n            nationwide.  Through the application of adjustment policy\n            measures, enrollments are expected to increase by about 32\n            percent by the 1994/95 school year without increasing the\n            share of education in the Government budget from its 1985/86\n            level.  The operation would also improve the quality of\n            primary education through the provision of textbooks,\n            development of revised curricula, and teacher upgrading programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Projet de developpement de\n            l'enseignement elementaire"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"S\u00e9n\u00e9gal \u2013 Projet de d\u00e9veloppement\n            de l\u2019enseignement \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire : S\u00e9n\u00e9gal\u00a0- Projet de\n            d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019enseignement \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1986/09/12160741/senegal-primary-education-development-project-senegal-projet-de-developpement-de-lenseignement-elementaire","projn":"SN-Primary Educ Dev -- P002325","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population,Education","count":"Senegal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100428051158"},"subsc":"Primary education","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population,Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Classrooms; Primary school teachers; Primary\n            education; Teacher training; Curriculum development;\n            Institution building; Textbook publication; Allocation of resources,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Classrooms; Primary school teachers; Primary\n            education; Teacher training; Curriculum development;\n            Institution building; Textbook publication; Allocation of resources,,"}},"owner":"WB:Dakar-FmcAFR1:SN/CV/CM/GW/MR (AFCF1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"6179","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Projet de developpement de\n            l'enseignement elementaire"}}},"facets":{}}}
