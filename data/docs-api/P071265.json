The lessons learned indicate that\n            Government's strong commitment to the reforms supported\n            by a technical assistance project is a decisive factor in\n            its success. Technical assistance operations are likely to\n            be more successful if clearly linked to adjustment\n            operations. Project implementation and outcomes benefit from\n            a simple project design and a limited number of components.\n            The implementation of a project involving different\n            counterparts increases supervision and coordination efforts.\n            Institutional capacity building programs carried out by\n            developing and/or strengthening local skills result in\n            increased ownership and sustainability of the project\n            outcomes. Close donor coordination and good policy dialogue\n            with the authorities help newly established institutions\n            build their market reputation as independent and\n            professional entities. The efficient and effective use of\n            the project funding requires trainees' strong\n            participation in and ownership of training programs.\n            Effectiveness of training programs can be fully assessed\n            only sometime after their completion. In Kosovo as well as\n            in other transitional realities, the hierarchical structure\n            of the society and its systems (e.g., judiciary system,\n            education system) is particularly strong and rigid, and\n            relatively hermetic. Locally-based World Bank support plays\n            a crucial role in ensuring good project design, effective\n            supervision, and good policy dialogue with relevant\n            stakeholders, including donors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro - Private\n            Sector Development Technical Assistance Grant"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro -\n            Private Sector Development Technical Assistance Grant"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/11/5501764/kosovo-serbia-montenegro-private-sector-development-technical-assistance-grant","projn":"XK-Private Sector Development Technical\n            Assistance Project -- P071265","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Judicial System Reform,Business Environment,Business in Development,ICT Policy and Strategies,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Kosovo","entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20041214090552"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Vocational training,Law and justice","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"Special Financing","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account, Accountancy, Accountants,\n            accounting, accounting curricula, accounting principles,\n            accounting reform, accounting standards, Auditing, auditing\n            profession, Auditing Standards, Auditors, autonomy, Bank\n            Performance, Bank supervision, bankruptcy, best practices,\n            bookkeeping, case management, commercial banks, commercial\n            legislation, economic activity, Economics, financial\n            management, Financial Reporting, Financial Reporting\n            Standards, FISCAL YEAR, foreign exchange, Institutional\n            Development, International Auditing Standards, international\n            organizations, laws, legal framework, Lessons Learned,\n            liquidation, management capacity, management information,\n            management requirements, mis, motivation, operating costs,\n            Partnership, performance indicators, personality, policy\n            framework, PRIVATE SECTOR, procurement, professional\n            training, project implementation, project preparation,\n            public sector, Quality Assurance, Quality Assurance Group,\n            quality control, small enterprises, Supervision, tax\n            administration, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, Trade Names,\n            Vocational training, working environment"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF027806-KOSOVO-PRIVATE SECTOR\n            DEVELOPMENT - TECHNICAL ASISTANCE,TF030359-ITALIAN CTF (EE) FY03 - ECA,TF030452-ITALIAN CTF (EE) FY04 - ECA\n            (ALBANIA, AZERBAIJAN, BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, B","repnb":"29844"},"1047341":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2001/03/1047341/kosovo-federal-republic-yugoslavia-private-sector-development-technical-assistance-grant-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2001/03/1047341/kosovo-federal-republic-yugoslavia-private-sector-development-technical-assistance-grant-project","new_url":"2001/03/1047341/kosovo-federal-republic-yugoslavia-private-sector-development-technical-assistance-grant-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/03/30/000094946_01031705494267/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/03/30/000094946_01031705494267/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","datestored":"2002-10-11T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2001-03-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -\n            Private Sector Development Technical Assistance Grant Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Private Sector Development Technical\n            Assistance Grant Project, will enable, and improve the\n            business environment for private sector growth in Kosovo.\n            Its components will: 1) support the establishment, and\n            operation of a modern business registry system, which will\n            allow enterprises to acquire legal personality, as described\n            in the new business organization regulation.
