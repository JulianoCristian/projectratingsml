Highway 1A\n            is Vietnam's most important transport artery\n            facilitating the movement of goods and people and underpins\n            its economy. HRP 1, through restoring significant sections\n            of that highway, was highly relevant to the country's\n            economic priorities. The project also represented an\n            opportunity to lay the groundwork for longer-term\n            collaboration between Vietnam and IDA in the transport\n            sector. Transport sector strategy at appraisal agreed\n            between Government of Vietnam (GOV) and the Bank was to\n            focus assistance on the rehabilitation of existing\n            infrastructure rather than new construction projects. This\n            strategy was justified at the time because it was clear that\n            the economy in the early 1990s was radically changing for\n            the better, but uncertainties about the sustainability of\n            the economic transformation made it difficult to predict\n            future transport demand. Nevertheless, worldwide experience\n            of countries transitioning toward a market economy has shown\n            that one of the first pressure points due to pent-up demand\n            is usually to rapidly expand capacity for road transport\n            through increasing the capacity of under-developed road\n            systems. Therefore it could be argued that the conservative\n            approach adopted in this project may not have been the most\n            relevant or appropriate investment strategy. In the view of\n            the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) team the\n            failure to anticipate the future capacity constraints\n            suggests a high rating would be inappropriate and it is on\n            this basis that substantial was selected."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam -

Lessons highlight the hands-on-training\n            approach undertaken by the project, as an effective capacity\n            building method, but points that clear objectives, and\n            institutional arrangements are needed. Such method was\n            implicit in the project design, which resulted in a high\n            level of capacity, and knowledge being exchanged during\n            implementation, and, allowed focusing on a limited number of\n            high return investments, rather than spreading larger\n            numbers over wider areas, thus avoiding complex project\n            elements, and implementation arrangements. Contributing\n            factors to this approach were an open dialogue, selective\n            technical assistance, and high-level of project supervision.\n            However, and particularly in transition economies, careful\n            consideration is required to build capacity, and supervision\n            arrangements, especially so, in the absence of experience\n            with international financial management practices,\n            contracting, or procurement procedures. It is worth noting,\n            that since the public sector may still be dominant in Viet\n            Nam, clear guidelines, and qualification criteria should be\n            established for state-owned enterprises, at the early stages\n            of the project. And, to avoid undermining the benefits of\n            road improvements, road safety must be given sufficient\n            visibility at all levels of project design, supervision, and operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Viet Nam -
