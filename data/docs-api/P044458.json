Two main lessons\n            emerge from this project experience: 1) In an emergency\n            reconstruction program, it is essential to have a workable\n            coordination system in place to avoid duplication of effort\n            and inconsistent applications of policy that lead to\n            different treatment.  regimes. The objectives of this\n            project were not attained at the planned level, as most\n            funding aid-agencies opted to work on their own (instead of\n            contributing to the agreed upon Sector Recovery Program\n            (SRP)). The use of differing sets of policy and procedures\n            caused confusion during project implementation, and\n            unplanned overlaps in donor activities led to a reduction in\n            the overall program scope. In the end, lack of coordination\n            weakened sector reform activities, and prevented the phased\n            implementation of the rest of the SRP operations within the\n            anticipated timeframe. 2) The rapid post-emergency appraisal\n            of operations sometimes requires flexibility, but it is\n            still necessary that key components be fully defined within\n            the project implementation period. In this case,\n            institutional strengthening should have included\n            well-specified and realistic activities that would have\n            assisted sector agencies to improve operational efficiency\n            in incremental steps. In the midst of hectic repair and\n            rehabilitation efforts, institutional development measures\n            such as reducing unaccounted water, improving efficiency and\n            skills of staff and improving collection of bills, received\n            lower priority. A stepwise package of the most urgent\n            measures should have been defined in the project documents\n            to ensure that the various entities could take needed first\n            steps to return to normal operations after the crisis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Water, Sanitation\n            and Solid Waste Urgent Works

overall\n            outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory. However,\n            the project's overall sustainability is rated as\n            unlikely. This is due, in part, to country conditions beyond\n            the control of the sector as well as because much of the\n            reform agenda still remains to be implemented. Overall, Bank\n            performance is adjudged satisfactory although it could have\n            been more effective regarding institutional strengthening\n            and donor coordination. Similarly, Borrower performance is\n            rated as satisfactory. Lessons relevant for other emergency\n            reconstruction projects are: Although projects of this type\n            tend to focus on the more urgent physical investment\n            interventions, their eventual sustainability is affected by\n            achieving the necessary institutional and policy\n            improvements. Project design should therefore include\n            explicit objectives to be achieved in a phased manner,\n            including improving the financial state of the utilities and\n            strengthening management and operations. The Bank should\n            take the lead in seeking and achieving donor coordination\n            and consistency in key project matters, including the design\n            and implementation of the policy and institutional\n            framework. The project's content and impact should be\n            assessed conservatively, close to the core of Bank financing\n            allocated. Implementation arrangements should build on\n            locally available expertise, and expatriate technical\n            assistance should be limited."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia-Herzegovina -

are to: (i) restore\n            water, sanitation and solid waste services to the population\n            depending on pipe water supply and water borne sewerage\n            systems to a level that would mitigate public health risk in\n            priority areas; (ii) develop a long term sector strategy and\n            the details of an emergency project consistent with the\n            strategy; (iii) rebuild and strengthen sector institutions\n            so that the improvements will be sustainable; and (iv)\n            prepare final designs and bidding documents for the\n            rehabilitation project. The project consists of five parts:\n            (a) the supply of equipment and materials, including pipe,\n            fittings, spare parts and rolling stock for water, sewerage\n            and solid waste disposal operating organizations to meet\n            urgent requirements for systems operations; (b) urgent works\n            for the provision of water supply, sanitation and solid\n            waste services for municipalities, including rehabilitation\n            and repair of water sources and distribution networks; (c)\n            emergency development plan for the water management sector;\n            (d) institutional strengthening, focusing on strategic\n            planning and sector organization, project, financial and\n            maintenance management,
