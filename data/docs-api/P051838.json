Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) a standards-based approach in education\n            has much to recommend it in terms of clear expectations for\n            outcomes, objective evidence of achievement, planning for\n            growth or development, and rewarding progress; 2) changes in\n            teaching methods are best achieved through combining theory\n            and practice, as happened when teachers undertook training\n            modules while involved in teaching the new curriculum; 3)\n            teachers appreciated the Professional Profile because it\n            defined their work, set targets for improvement, and offered\n            rewards for better performance; and 4) the motivation for\n            teachers to engage in self improvement could be impeded\n            unless performance appraisal is included in the criteria for\n            teachers' titles, along with qualifications."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Primary Teacher

The project has four main components. The\n            first develops teacher professional standards (profile) by\n            supporting a Profile Coordination Team, applies the profile\n            to training courses and to teacher assessment, and finances\n            action research to refine the profile. The second component\n            funds a training program for teachers and education\n            managers. It specifically finances a needs assessment and\n            specification of the contents of the training packages and\n            preparation of trial training packages, improves the\n            capacity of teacher training institutes, supports the\n            appraisal of training packages, and publishes and delivers\n            training modules. The third component provides suppots for a\n            Quality Assurance Team, improves the personnel management\n            information system, develops accreditation and teacher\n            classification procedures, and provides communications and\n            training for school improvement.
