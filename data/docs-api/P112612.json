A lesson learned\n            included the government following a traditional and cautious\n            reform approach focused on the development of new\n            instruments and their pilot-testing in a growing number of\n            ministries. The reform was pursued without changing the\n            legal and regulatory framework, a part from the reform on\n            internal controls. While limiting risks, this approach has\n            led to a reform fatigue, with many ministries now in a\n            waiting mode. The visibility of the reform needs to be\n            strengthened both within the administration and with members\n            of the public, taxpayers, and users of public services. The\n            time scale for this kind of complex structural reforms (ten\n            years on average) makes it hard to achieve visible results\n            in the short to medium term. The crosscutting and very\n            technical nature of these reforms make it difficult to\n            establish a link with visible government services. It is\n            therefore necessary to increase information and\n            communication on the reform, based on clear short-term\n            results and planned according to the rapid results approach.\n            Giving increased attention to public service provision and\n            providers and strengthening synergies with related reforms,\n            such as the quality of public services approach and the\n            fight against corruption, will increase the reform's\n            visibility and short-term benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Third and Fourth Public\n

The objectives of the series\n            aim at: (a) improving Government efficiency in the\n            management of budget resources through greater transparency\n            and accountability, and by introducing performance\n            measurement; (b) improving government efficiency in the\n            management of human resources through the preparation of a\n            new management system for staffing and remuneration with\n            performance measurement, while streamlining current human\n            resources management; (c) consolidating and controlling\n            public payroll; and (d) improving public services and\n            simplifying procedures through e-government. Public\n            administration reform is viewed as a core component of\n            improving governance and is central to the economic and\n            social reforms that the Government is carrying out to\n            improve economic performance and enhance its capacity to\n            achieve sustained growth. The reform program is aimed at\n            ensuring the viability of the macroeconomic framework by\n            improving the efficiency of public expenditure and optimally\n            allocating budgetary resources. The key components of the\n            reform program include: results-oriented budget reform;\n            increased internal and external audit; improved human\n            resource management; increased quality of public services by\n            introducing localized management; consolidated public sector\n            payroll management; and, since 2007, simplified\n            administrative procedures including through the development\n            of e-government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Fourth Public Administration\n            Reform Development Policy Loan

The objectives of the series\n            aim at: (a) improving Government efficiency in the\n            management of budget resources through greater transparency\n            and accountability, and by introducing performance\n            measurement; (b) improving government efficiency in the\n            management of human resources through the preparation of a\n            new management system for staffing and remuneration with\n            performance measurement, while streamlining current human\n            resources management; (c) consolidating and controlling\n            public payroll; and (d) improving public services and\n            simplifying procedures through e-government. Public\n            administration reform is viewed as a core component of\n            improving governance and is central to the economic and\n            social reforms that the Government is carrying out to\n            improve economic performance and enhance its capacity to\n            achieve sustained growth. The reform program is aimed at\n            ensuring the viability of the macroeconomic framework by\n            improving the efficiency of public expenditure and optimally\n            allocating budgetary resources. The key components of the\n            reform program include: results-oriented budget reform;\n            increased internal and external audit; improved human\n            resource management; increased quality of public services by\n            introducing localized management; consolidated public sector\n            payroll management; and, since 2007, simplified\n            administrative procedures including through the development\n            of e-government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Maroc - Quatrieme pret a l'Appui des\n            Politiques de Developpement pour la

Improving public administration\n            performance : Morocco's civil service boosts\n            efficiency, adopts e-government"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"In Morocco the International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the government are\n            working to improve public administration, making it leaner,\n            more focused, and more efficient in the delivery of social\n            services. Through the program, Morocco's administrative\n            tradition is evolving from strict and bureaucratic legal\n            compliance to a search for better performance and more\n            effective public service. Since 2002, the government has\n            implemented a comprehensive Public Administration Reform\n            Support Program (PARP). To support the PARP the Bank has\n            prepared a series of programmatic development policy loans\n            with four medium-term objectives: a) improve government\n            efficiency in budget management; b) improve government\n            efficiency in human resources management; c) consolidate and\n            control the public payroll; and d) improve service delivery\n            and simplify public procedures through e-government. This\n            last component was added in the second PARP series following\n            government introduction in 2007 of e-governance as a core\n            element of its reform agenda. The main characteristic of\n            Bank support to the PARP has been the continuous combination\n            of programmatic development policy loans and programmatic\n            advisory and analytical activities. Both actions have been\n            reinforcing each other and have provided the momentum for\n            continuous progress. Through the loans provided under the\n            PARP, IBRD has provided: US$100 million under the first\n            phase, US$120 million under the second, US$100 million\n            through the third phase, and US$100 million under the fourth."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Maroc -
