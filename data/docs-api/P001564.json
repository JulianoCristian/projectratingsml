Rural communities can contribute\n            significantly towards the capital cost of the project,\n            mostly in kind, as well as 100 percent of operation and\n            maintenance cash costs. Economies of scale can be achieved\n            by grouping construction activities to be carried out in\n            small rural communities under large multi-year umbrella\n            contracts. It is necessary to include sanitation and\n            improved hygiene behavior in the design of a rural water\n            supply and sanitation project design from the very\n            beginning, as it appears very difficult to catch up during\n            project implementation. Hand washing with soap should be\n            part of any rural water supply and sanitation national\n            strategy as it is a key element for reducing the risk of\n            contracting intestinal diseases and thus improving health\n            outcomes of the project. Regular water quality testing and\n            measures to improve and maintain drinking quality water,\n            especially bacteriological standards, are necessary and must\n            be closely monitored."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar -

The project components are: 1) policy\n            and legal framework for the sector, assisting in: i)\n            reformulation of the water and sanitation sector policy and\n            implementation arrangements; ii) preparation of a water law;\n            and iii) promoting enforcement of water policy and\n            regulations; 2) sector reorganization and capacity building\n            to ensure that sector organization is relevant to the policy\n            framework; and 3) community based water and sanitation\n            services (pilot), to be implemented in two parts -part A:\n            assisting the Government in preparing a community needs\n            assessment, education and support studies in order to reach\n            a better knowledge of sector; and part B: assistance in\n            water and sanitation services extension, including\n            boreholes, gravity systems and civil works to support the\n            sector capacity building efforts.
