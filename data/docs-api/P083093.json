The most important lessons learnt from this\n            operation show that successful change does not come easily.\n            Clearly, progress with respect to privatization has moved\n            slower than what was originally envisaged. One of the\n            reasons given to the World Bank Coal Team is the general\n            negative opinion that the public has regarding privatization\n            of other industries: like steel and shipyards. There is\n            concern over potential job losses and the transfer of\n            profits outside of the country. It seems apparent to the\n            World Bank Coal Team that so far there has not been a fully\n            adequate explanation to the mining companies workers of the\n            potential benefits of privatization to them. Both Spolka\n            Restrukturyzacji Kopaln S.A. (Mine Restructuring Company)\n            (SRK) and Bytomska Spolka Restrukturyzacji Kopaln Sp. z o.o.\n            (BSRK) underlined that the beginning of the Projects\n            implementation has been a challenge for them since they were\n            not familiar with the World Banks procurement procedures,\n            however thanks to the regular trainings organized by the\n            Banks staff and frequent updates of the Operations Manual,\n            these procedures were eventually internalized. The\n            implication is that the use of Sector Wide Approach (SWAps)\n            may be most effective where differences in Banks procurement\n            and national procurement procedures are minimal, easily\n            resolved and conveyed to implementing agencies prior to\n            implementation, in cases where country systems are\n            undeveloped or inadequate and full harmonization of\n            procedures is not possible."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland -

The Hard Coal Mine Closure Project will directly\n            support the physical closure, and environmental reclamation\n            of excess coal mine capacity from CY 2004-2006. It envisages\n            main economic and social objectives, that improve\n            profitability, and the financial liquidity of the sector,\n            i.e., allows regular payments of its liabilities, including\n            payments of environmental fees, and, mitigates the social\n            consequences of the program's implementation. The\n            objectives are to be achieved through reform, in the areas\n            of industry structure, mine closure, employment and\n            financial restructuring, and, privatization. Through its\n            five components the project will, first, liquidate\n            underground workings and shafts, remove equipment, and\n            secure underground areas. This will entail closure of\n            underground roadways through dams, and if necessary,\n            dewatering should prevent water hazards to neighboring\n            operating mines, keeping the underground partly functional.\n            Following liquidation, demolition and clearing surface\n            structures will take place. Activities include shafts\n            liquidation, by isolating materials such as clay, closing\n            with a cement cap; demolition of existing buildings, or, if\n            possible, for sale option; dismantling of installations,\n            structures, and equipment; stabilization of waste dumps,\n            and, closure of tailings ponds. Preparation of a\n            comprehensive dewatering master plan, environmental\n            management plans, and mine closure plans, including\n            engineering design studies and supporting documentation will\n            be conducted. Land reclamation will be implemented in two\n            phases: a) preparation of land for industrial activity,\n            which will include clean up and ground leveling, and, b)\n            preparation of land for recreational purposes, to include\n            remediation actions, such as vegetation propagation.\n            Finally, following the mine closure, monitoring and\n

It is required to ensure participation of\n            the society in the process regarding environmental impacts\n            leading to the environmental assessment, and, to disseminate\n            information on mines closures to local communities and\n            nongovernmental organizations. To this end, the environment\n            management framework (v. 1) stipulates the following\n            mitigation measures. A waste management plan shall be in\n            place for appropriate disposal of wastes generated by the\n            debris from building structures, machine, and equipment.\n            Particular attention will be given to the final waste\n            disposal of dangerous materials, i.e., asbestos, oils and\n            lubricants, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), to comply\n            with international standard regulation. Contractors will be\n            responsible of waste collection, transportation, and\n            disposal, through a binding precautionary clause contained\n            in the bid documents, in strict compliance with\n            environmental regulations. In addition, contractors will\n            also be responsible for the use of new technologies that\n            ensure minimum noise and dust emissions, as well as\n            appropriate casings or protective barriers, and spraying\n            surfaces regularly.
