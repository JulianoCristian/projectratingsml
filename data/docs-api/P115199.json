Some lessons learned includes: as with the DPL\n            series, strong government ownership and the Bank's\n            extensive engagement on the ground were key contributing\n            aspects of a successfully executed operation. Still, the use\n            of a DDO was a new experience for the Indonesia office and\n            some key lessons came to light. When uncertainty is high,\n            but a country's fundamentals are strong, the Bank can\n            be an effective partner in helping to reassure the markets.\n            As it was the first time since the 1997-98 Asian crisis that\n            market volatility was so severe, there was a great fear that\n            the country would be ensnared in the global financial\n            crisis, despite the sounder macroeconomic fundamentals it\n            held this time around. Access to financing was not\n            sufficient on its own to calm markets. As several investors\n            in the survey pointed out, Indonesia's strong macro\n            fundamentals, such as the government's decision to a\n            limited budget deficit despite potential revenue short\n            falls, were key to reassuring markets that Indonesia was\n            stable. Sending a strong signaling effect can be as\n            effective as providing straight financial support. The\n            sustainability of results in such emergency operations\n            depends on post-crisis priorities. The Government of\n            Indonesia and all parties involved in the preparation of\n            this operation devoted much attention at the time of the\n            crisis. Economic surveillance and monitoring was\n            significantly increased by Government of Indonesia (GoI) and\n            partners during supervision. Refining the DDO package.\n            Unlike other DDO operations, the purpose of this DDO was not\n            to serve as a lower cost financing option, but rather as\n            insurance against prohibitively high financing costs which\n            would jeopardize Indonesia's development efforts.\n            Securing financing at accessible prices for a rainy day was\n            more beneficial to GoI than securing financing at cheaper\n            prices in a relatively benign market environment, as it was\n            in mid 2009 and until the closing of the operation.\n            Dissemination of the merits of a contingency-based operation\n            is important to ensure stakeholders have a good\n            understanding of its costs and benefits. People that were\n            closely involved in discussions during the preparation of\n            the PESF are well aware of the benefits of the operation,\n            particularly relative to the very low costs incurred by GoI."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Public Expenditure Support\n            Facility Development Policy Loan with Deferred Drawdown\n            Option

Like many other\n            developing economies, Indonesia has had to cope with the\n            immediate ripple effects of the turmoil and crisis of\n            confidence that has disrupted the global financial system in\n            the last few months, while at the same time preparing for an\n            anticipated growth slowdown and continued tight liquidity in\n            2009. The government has responded proactively to the\n            rapidly evolving situation and the Bank and other partners\n            have assisted in and continue to support these efforts. The\n            PESF represents an opportunity to provide enhanced support\n            to an important client with a sustained record of prudent\n            macroeconomic management and fiscal discipline at a time of\n            increased stresses in global financial markets. The\n            government has clearly indicated that it feels that the\n            Bank's engagement on the policy dialogue is critical,\n            both in terms of the substantive support provided as well as\n            in terms of the signal it sends to the market and to\n            Indonesia's bilateral and multilateral partners. At the\n            same time, by helping Indonesia to meet its gross financing\n            needs in the event that liquidity conditions do not ease,\n            the PESF would ensure that Indonesia is able to maintain and\n            even scale up public spending on critical infrastructure and\n            human capital investments and social protection at a time\n            when they are most
