Nonetheless, under the circumstances, the\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower were\n            rated satisfactory. Experiences with this new instrument\n            demonstrated the following: The Bank successfully developed\n            a \"rapid response capability\" to help borrowers\n            deal quickly and effectively with unexpected, turbulent\n            international financial and economic difficulties. The Bank\n            could provide an important element of long-term finance when\n            it is not available for timely support of urgent reforms.\n            These lessons also point out that recent\n            \"graduates\" could still be supported by the Bank\n            during an economic crisis--even middle income countries with\n            prior access to private capital markets. Although this SSAL\n            allowed the Bank to respond flexibly and in an exceptional\n            manner to Argentina's 1998 crisis, it raised some\n            questions about the new instrument such as assumptions about\n            political risk, and the ability to provide liquidity and\n            manage grave external finance shortages while enacting\n            structural reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Special Structural Adjustment\n            Loan (SSAL) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Special Structural\n            Adjustment
