Starting from 1993, the World Bank\n            provided 6 loans totaling United States (U.S.) 1083.4\n            million dollars for the development of Ukraine's main\n            state institutions. 1993-1999, the institutional loan\n            project was implemented (the total cost of the project was\n            U.S. 44 million dollars; the World Bank loan is 27 million).\n            In 1994-1996, the rehabilitation loan project was\n            implemented (U.S. 500 million dollars).

This loan is aimed at\n            resolving some problem issues of Ukrainian reforms and,\n            specifically in the area of fiscal and financial discipline,\n            regulatory policy, forming and protecting of ownership\n            rights, and achieving of social stability. For project\n            implementation, a series of programmatic adjustment loans\n            are to be provided, aimed at achieving the efficiency of the\n            government performance. The project supports the Ukrainian\n            government's efforts to build up the functional and\n            computerized treasury system which is expected to increase\n            the efficiency of the budget execution and ensure its\n            implementation in full scope and more controllable cash\n            flow. The project supports the state tax\n            administration's efforts to develop and introduce a\n            single system of state registration of tax payers at\n            Ukraine's tax bodies, and a system of supervising the\n            calculation and receipt of payments, as well as\n            reorganization of the tax service by the functional principle."},"docna":{"cdata!":"World Bank projects related to public sector reform"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"World Bank projects related to\n            public sector reform"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2004/04/23955129/world-bank-projects-related-public-sector-reform","count":"Ukraine","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adjustment, Adjustment Loan, Adjustment\n            Loans, Bank loan, cash flow, corruption, deposit, deposit\n            accounts, economic development, Economic Reforms, equipment,\n            financial discipline, foreign currency, funds management,\n            Institutional Loan, institutional reforms, international\n            standards, National Bank, ownership rights, Rehabilitation\n            Loan, reorganization, salaries, social protection, Tax, Tax\n            Administration, tax base, tax burden, tax legislation, tax\n            system, taxation, technical assistance, treasury, wages,\n            World Bank loan"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Rehabilitation Loan"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Economic management,Financial and private sector development","topic":"Public Sector Downsizing m1327494 2085,Public Finance m1326315 713,Public Administration m1327723 723,Public Sector Management m1326314 696,Public Service Delivery m1326771 728","projn":"UA-Rehabilitation -- P009108,UA-Institution Building -- P009106","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Economic Adjustment and Lending,Taxation & Subsidies,Emerging Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Private Sector Development","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150204144051"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Banking,Power,General industry and trade sector,Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance,Sub-national government administration,Payments, settlements, and remittance systems,Central government administration","theme":"Infrastructure services for private sector development,Macroeconomic management,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Regulation and competition policy,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Debt management and fiscal sustainability,Other economic management,Tax policy and administration","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Private Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Public Sector Downsizing m1327494 2085,Public Finance m1326315 713,Public Administration m1327723 723,Public Sector Management m1326314 696,Public Service Delivery m1326771 728","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C","U"],"trustfund":"TF023660-DUTCH CTF FOR EASTERN EUROPE,TF027980-SWISS CONSULTANT TRUST FUND FOR\n            EASTERN EUROPE AND THE CIS,TF020232-REHABILITATION LOAN,TFM20232-REHABILITATION LOAN,TFS20232-REHABILITATION LOAN","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"repnb":"92195"},"694276":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1997/09/694276/ukraine-ukraine-rehabilitation-loan","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1997/09/694276/ukraine-ukraine-rehabilitation-loan","new_url":"1997/09/694276/ukraine-ukraine-rehabilitation-loan","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1997/09/05/000009265_3980420172053/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1997/09/05/000009265_3980420172053/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","loan_no":"3831","datestored":"1997-09-05T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1997-09-05T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Ukraine -

Rehabilitation Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Rehabilitation Loan\n            Project for Ukraine were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, project sustainability was uncertain, Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            there is a strong tendency in the Bank to be over-optimistic\n            about the outcomes of adjustment operations, both in terms\n            of macroeconomic objectives as well as structural changes.\n            To the extent possible, the Bank should seek to involve in\n            policy discussions those in government who are skeptical\n            about reforms, especially when they pertain to agriculture\n            and the social sectors. This may be time consuming and\n            difficult, but ultimately beneficial. Given the uncertain\n            political support for reforms, the limited institutional\n            capacity and the uncertainties of predicting the nature and\n            size of supply response, it would be prudent to maintain\n            realistic expectations and to be flexible in response to\n            slippages in policy and projected outcomes. The phased\n            disbursement design of the Ukraine Rehabilitation Loan was a\n            useful innovation in this regard. A suitably empowered\n            authority within the Government to coordinate and oversee\n            progress in reforms is vital not only for the indigenous\n            development of the reform program, but also to prevent\n            implementation of sectoral policies that go against the\n            spirit of the economy-wide reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Rehabilitation Loan
