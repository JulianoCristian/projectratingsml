The objects of the credit are\n            to enhance private sector-based growth, redeploy budgetary\n            expenditures towards key social sectors and small holder\n            agriculture and provide support for drought-relief. The\n            credit has four main components. First, it will improve\n            foreign exchange allocation and export incentives by\n            developing a consolidated market for foreign exchange,\n            liberalizing prices of manufactured products and reforming\n            agricultural marketing. Second, it will strengthen the role\n            of the Central Bank, improve access to credit by the private\n            sector and develop commercial banking services. Third, the\n            credit will accelerate the restructuring and privatization\n            of the state enterprise sector and establish a transparent\n            system for privatization. Fourth, the credit will reorient\n            budgetary expenditures to protect a set of high-priority\n            activities in primary health, primary and secondary\n            education, smallholders in agriculture, and provide support\n            for the implementation of limited targeted direct income\n            transfers to poor households. The proceeds of the credit\n            will be used by Mozambique to support the enlargement of the\n            secondary market and finance technical assistance to\n            strengthen the government's capacity to extend the\n            privatization process to large enterprises and reform the\n            banking sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Economic Recovery Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Economic Recovery\n            Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/05/736822/mozambique-economic-recovery-program-project","projn":"MZ-Econ.
