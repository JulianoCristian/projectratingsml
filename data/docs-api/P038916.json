The positive lessons learned are: 1) Social\n            Investment Emergency Fund's (FISE's) institutional\n            capacity made it possible to effect a systematic change,\n            which was facilitated by the close collaboration of FISE and\n            major donors. 2) Highly experienced senior management and\n            technical staff and their continuity have been absolutely\n            critical to the project's success. 3) The increasing\n            complexity of social investment funds requires substantial\n            International Development Association supervision. 4) The\n            sustainability of investments is directly linked to\n            beneficiary participation. The negative lessons learned are:\n            a) FISE's operational efficiency is dependent upon the\n            abilities of ministries and government agencies. b) Social\n            investment funds operate in a political environment which\n            involves pressures of a political nature on decision-making\n            that may be inescapable. c) The lack of effective\n            coordination at all levels had a negative impact on\n            implementation performance. d) The organizational\n            difficulties in the water supply and sanitation sector were\n            underestimated. e) The depreciation of the special drawing\n            rights and consequent reduction in funding for FISE's\n            investment program covered by the credit taught FISE that\n            multiple currency credits can be risky."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua -
