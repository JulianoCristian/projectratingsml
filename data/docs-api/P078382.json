The Bank and borrower\n            performance were moderately satisfactory. The risk to\n            development outcome was moderate. Significant changes\n            included changes to subcomponents in response to practical\n            constraints that emerged - mainly implementation delays and\n            escalating project costs and two restructurings. Several\n            lessons were learned. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, the\n            Kampala Institutional and Infrastructure Development Project\n            adopted, complemented and strengthened the\n            organization's strategy and the Strategic Framework for\n            Reform (SFR) and filled in the resource gap where needed.\n            This was essential to the sustainability of the\n            institutional objectives as it ensured ownership, was not\n            disruptive, avoided duplication, and increased efficiency in\n            resource usage and implementation. Lessons can be drawn from\n            the improvements made by Kampala City Council (KCC)/The\n            Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) in its institutional\n            efficiency and governance. Firstly, there is a strong\n            continuity in the reform direction despite the transit of\n            KCC to KCCA. The new entity did not abandon the original\n            SFR, rather built upon it. Secondly, the SFR was\n            comprehensive and adopted a multi-pronged approach, covering\n            a range of areas from institution policy formulation and\n            performance; political support, management and teamwork;\n            organizational reform; management systems; communication and\n            corporate image building; financial recovery; and physical\n            planning and public health. Implementing agencies should\n            enforce more stringent standards when conducting due\n            diligence before contract award so as to avoid awarding\n            contracts to firms which do not have the requisite technical\n            staff, equipment and financial resources. Civil works\n            contracts should be packaged in such a way that they provide\n            sufficient incentives to attract competent firms with the\n            necessary capacity and resources to deliver on the\n            assignment. It is crucial for the implementing agency to\n            check on the performance of both the contractor and\n            supervising consultants directly and frequently. Ensuring\n            that there is sufficient human and financial capacity\n            requires upfront planning and preparation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - A Kampala Institutional and\n
