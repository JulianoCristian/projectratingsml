This assessment confirms a number of OED lessons\n            from the education sector. Countries that have limited\n            literacy rates, and few schools may benefit from a strategy\n            that simultaneously pursues, both supply-side (school\n            construction, teacher training), and demand-side (public\n            campaigns to enroll girls) interventions. However, even if\n            enrollment increases, potential gains may be lost upon\n            students drop out. School authorities must be sensitized to\n            the needs and problems of rural students, and actively try\n            to prevent drop out, particularly among those not yet\n            functionally literate. Furthermore, by itself, student\n            enrollment does not guarantee acquisition of basic skills.\n            It is also necessary to use classroom time wisely, ensure\n            that textbooks are available, provide in-service teacher\n            training, and allow for systematic supervision, i.e.,\n            attention to education quality. The strategy of employing\n            female teachers may fall short of expectations due to\n            budgetary constrains, and the low numbers of qualified women\n            willing to work in rural areas. Recruiting women who already\n            live in rural areas, even if they have a relatively limited\n            education, may be a sound way to increase the number of\n            female teachers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Basic Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6074130/yemen-basic-education-project","projn":"RY-Basic Education -- P005904","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050719102810"},"admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Primary education","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absenteeism, achievement tests,\n            achievements, age cohort, aged, Asbestos, BASIC EDUCATION,\n            basic skills, child development, classrooms, community\n            involvement, Construction costs, Country Assistance\n            Strategies, Curricula, curriculum, decentralization,\n            distance education, education budget, education facilities,\n            education level, education projects, education quality,\n            education sector, educational quality, Educational Research,\n            educational television, educators, effective schools,\n            Enrollment, enrollment rate, families, female enrollment,\n            Female participation, female teachers, Gender gap, gender\n            parity, girls, Gross Enrollment, Gross Enrollment Rates,\n            housing, human development, Innovation, inservice training,\n            Institutional Development, instruction, instructors,\n            interventions, laws, leadership, Learning, Learning\n            Achievement, Learning Outcomes, literacy, literacy rate,\n            malnutrition, media, nonformal education, Papers, parents,\n            peer review, per capita income, Poverty Reduction, primary\n            education, primary education budget, primary school, primary\n            schools, principals, printing, Quality Assurance, quality\n            education, Quality of Education, reading, Repetition, rural\n            areas, rural schools, safety, school buildings, school\n            construction, school enrollments, School furniture, school\n            inspection, Schools, secondary education, social services,\n            student achievement, student enrollment, Student\n            Enrollments, student performance, student places, teacher,\n            teacher effectiveness, teacher pay, teacher salaries,\n            teacher training, teacher training projects, technical\n            education, Technical Training, textbooks, training centers,\n            universities, urban areas, Vocational Education, Vocational\n            Training, young people"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF020254-BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT FOR THE\n            REPUBLIC OF YEMEN,TF020600-FINNISH GENERAL CONSULTANT\n            TRUST FUND,TF032903-EUROPE AND MIDDLE EAST -\n            EDUCATION (EGYPT, YEMEN, JORDAN),TFM20254-BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT FOR THE\n            REPUBLIC OF YEMEN,TFS20254-BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT FOR THE\n            REPUBLIC OF YEMEN","repnb":"32594"},"1561401":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2001/06/1561401/yemen-basic-education-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2001/06/1561401/yemen-basic-education-project","new_url":"2001/06/1561401/yemen-basic-education-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/09/18/000094946_01082804004283/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/09/18/000094946_01082804004283/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","credit_no":"2412","datestored":"2001-09-18T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2001-06-29T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Basic Education Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The assessment of outcome was\n            satisfactory, sustainability highly likely, though\n            institutional development impacts are modest. Among the main\n            lessons, the importance of clearly defining the expected\n            outcomes of administrative entities is reinforced, to be\n            accomplished through specific terms of reference with\n            detailed roles, and responsibilities, and, developed for\n            implementation prior to loan effectiveness. In addition, it\n            is recommended that periodic reviews, and implementation\n            progress be pursued, with the subsequent report issuance for\n            consideration by the funding agencies, and borrower. And, in\n            the absence of strong procurement capacity, particularly in\n            light of large civil works, and procurement of goods, and\n            consultant services, it would have been wise to carry out a\n            procurement capacity assessment, implemented during\n            appraisal, or prior to effectiveness. This could have solved\n            specific issues, and avoided implementation delays. Once\n            again, the importance for community involvement at an early\n            stage of the project is emphasized, by adequately\n            structuring their assistance in planning, supporting, and\n            implementing their roles, and responsibilities, potentially\n            avoiding delays in site selections, and reducing unit costs,\n            while ensuring project sustainability. Other lessons\n            emphasize the need to define technical assistance based on a\n            preliminary institutional assessment; assess project impacts\n            using clear monitoring indicators; and, provide adequate\n            funding for teachers supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Basic Education
