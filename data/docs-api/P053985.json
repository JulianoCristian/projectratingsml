Several lessons have been learned, of which\n            the most important are the following:  However attractive a\n            project, the risks must be carefully weighed both culturally\n            and politically. As it turned out, the situation became far\n            more unstable than anyone anticipated-at times bordering on\n            catastrophic, overwhelming all available mitigation\n            measures. If the institutional arrangements are carefully\n            considered, if a clear and adequate mandate is given, if\n            adequate supporting resources are provided, and if capable\n            leadership is in place, Palestinian institutions are capable\n            of delivering very effectively. B2000 Authority's\n            success proves the point. Leadership-This was in large\n            measure the key B2000 Authority success.  Stakeholder\n            Involvement is not easy to secure in Palestine, and was\n            particularly difficult in the Bethlehem area. Initially, all\n            parties seemed suspicious of each other, and none thought\n            the others were trustworthy, up to the job, or likely to\n            deliver. This view persisted almost up to the 'tenth\n            hour'. Ironically, due partly to the experience of\n            reoccupation, the parties are now more appreciative of each\n            other's roles, capabilities and achievements.\n            Mobilizing the Private Sector: Much more could probably have\n            been achieved in the areas of marketing and sponsorship if\n            the private sector had been more closely involved at an\n            early stage of the project. Not surprisingly, the public\n            sector orientation of the leadership of the B2000 Authority\n            and the widespread and mutual lack of trust militated\n            against this  involvement. Clearly, a basis of trust has to\n            be built before the benefits of private sector participation\n            can be secured. The area municipalities have come a long way\n            during the project. This is due to several factors: first\n            the Authority showed the way in improving the infrastructure\n            and staging the celebrations; second they were determined\n            not to take (or be forced to take) a back seat in the\n            development process and responded to the challenge; and\n            third they made the effort to take advantage of the (much\n            reduced) capacity building opportunities offered under the\n            project. They did so through the preparation of diagnostic\n            studies, and through their participation in mobilizing and\n            managing the damage repair and job creation program in their\n            areas. Finally, it is desirable start the municipal capacity\n            building effort earlier-all things being equal.\n            Responsiveness and Close On-Ground Bank Supervision:\n            Significant progress can be made even in a very difficult\n            environment if adequate local leadership exists, and the\n            Bank team is sensitive and responsive to the problems and\n            takes quick and decisive action. This can occur most\n            effectively when there is close on-ground Bank supervision\n            and excellent relations with clients-as there generally is\n            in the West Bank and Gaza."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza -
