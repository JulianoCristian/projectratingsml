Some lessons learned included:\n            the need for simplicity in project architecture: the US$5.7\n            million project design included 32 technical assistance (TA)\n            contracts and 22 goods contracts. A key lesson is that small\n            TA operations must be designed simply. Capacity-building for\n            the Pipeline Steering and Monitoring Committee (PSMC) should\n            have been adapted to the implementation capacity of the\n            country and the immediate need to address the environmental\n            and social monitoring of the Chad Cameroun Petroleum Export\n            Project (CCPP). This lesson reinforces the need for\n            simplicity in design and management of expectations. CAPECE\n            has demonstrated that in the case of large infrastructure\n            projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon pipeline, building long\n            term capacity for environmental and social management takes\n            longer and is more challenging than building the\n            infrastructure itself."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon -
