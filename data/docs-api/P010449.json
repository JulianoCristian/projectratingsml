Likewise, the Borrower performance is\n            rated satisfactory; in contrast though, the Bank\n            performance, while generally good, compels an unsatisfactory\n            performance rating, due to a violation of the Involuntary\n            Resettlement safeguard. Lessons convey, first, that it is\n            possible to turn around the strategy of a large public\n            entity from command-and-control, to community participation\n            quite quickly, given commitment at high levels. Therefore,\n            sustained, skills development for government staff, and for\n            stakeholders in participatory processes, over periods longer\n            than a single project is necessary. Second, in any tribal\n            forest situation, there is a high potential for involuntary\n            resettlement. During the project review, Bank management\n            should carefully question claims in natural forest\n            management projects, where involuntary resettlement issues\n            should be anticipated. Third, even where a high percentage\n            of the poor are forest dependent, it is much easier to\n            manage forests for trees, than for the poor; hence,\n            equitable distribution of the benefits, needs early\n            attention through pro-poor policy, government and community\n            processes, and resource management systems. Fourth, economic\n            analysis of community development interventions will usually\n            be incomplete, if it assesses only the net benefits\n            associated with members themselves, or their allocated area.\n            This is because others may have previously utilized\n            resources inside the boundary, and also because members may\n            have previously utilized resources outside the boundary."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

Project sustainability is likely: the\n            institutional transformation within APFD and the willingness\n            and ability to adapt to the participatory approach to forest\n            management and protection, with support from an established\n            training cell, suggests that project gains will be\n            maintained and enhanced. Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performances were rated satisfactory. Some of the major\n            lessons learned are summed up: Forestry programs contribute\n            significantly to poverty alleviation. People's\n            participation is essential and effective in protecting and\n            developing degraded forests. Building trust between people\n            and the department helps project implementation. Preparation\n            of a good microplan helps to effectuate implementation.\n            Organizations provide better access to delivering benefits.\n            Combined training of organization members and department\n            staff establishes better relationships and trust, which\n            improves project implementation. Integrating village\n            development and forestry development helps effectively\n            protect the latter. More interaction and input among\n            homogenous groups increases success in heterogenous groups.\n            Empowerment of women is crucial for the program's\n            success. Alternative energy sources such as biogas and\n            smokeless chullahas save time and fuel consumption."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Andhra Pradesh Forestry
