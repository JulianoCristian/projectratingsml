Lessons\n            suggest that in countries undergoing rapid state\n            transformation, operations responsive to comprehensive\n            institutional reform, and capacity building, will likely be\n            more effective provided project design allows flexibility,\n            linked to a clearly defined framework. And, the success of\n            such integrated approach depends not only on political\n            consensus, and commitment, but on a robust strategic\n            framework, that capitalizes on a flexible technical\n            assistance (TA), and capacity building. Moreover, during\n            periods of state transformation, this strategy, focused on\n            capacity building, when complemented by serial budget\n            support operations, i.e., balance of payment support\n            operations such as structural adjustment loans, can pave the\n            way for increasingly sophisticated forms of support,\n            including demand-driven, performance-based capacity\n            building, and fiscal support. However, in-service training\n            for civil servants, tends not to be aligned with the broader\n            performance objectives of public institutions, with varying\n            degrees of cost, and quality. But the advantage provided by\n            demand-driven matching grants, such as those financed under\n            the Training Funds component, encouraged government agencies\n            to assess training, introduce service standards, and reduce\n            unit costs by promoting competition. Further lessons suggest\n            investments in basic infrastructure to meet start-up costs\n            associated with local governance; decentralization of task\n            management to allow linkages between project activities, and\n            evolving reforms; and, closer focus to ensure coherence, and\n            streamlined design to facilitate implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Institutional Capacity Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Institutional Capacity\n            Building Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/06/1953746/uganda-institutional-capacity-building-project","projn":"UG-Inst.
