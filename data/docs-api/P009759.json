In\n            addition, the Second Gujarat Irrigation Project will include\n            the preparation of future irrigation projects in India for\n            possible Bank Group financing, including Narmada development\n            projects. The project is designed to increase agricultural\n            production and the standard of living of the farmers in\n            Gujarat. The risks under the proposed project are those\n            normally associated with irrigation projects in India."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sector report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Second Gujarat Irrigation\n            Project (Vol. 2) : Sector report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/04/728647/india-second-gujarat-irrigation-project-vol-2-sector-report","projn":"IN-Gujarat Irrig.
