Some lessons learned included: only with\n            involvement of both central and local authorities and their\n            commitment to sustainable development of tourism through\n            capital investments, these kinds of projects can be\n            satisfactorily implemented. Capital investments should have\n            as a result the benefit for the whole local population, but\n            in the same time should secure the protection of environment\n            and sustainable spatial development, which consequently\n            requires substantial institutional strengthening. For\n            implementation of all high-risk projects from environmental\n            point of view, the domestic institutional and legislative\n            framework has to be adopted.

This\n            environmental impact assessment (EIA) evaluated\n            environmental risks associated with the project and\n            recommends measures to mitigation them. In this regard\n            mitigation measures include : ensure proper applicability of\n            the Republic of Montenegro existing laws and regulations\n            related to the protection of the environment, and the Bank\n            's operational policy on the protection of the\n            environment; exert constant pre-treatment monitoring and\n            constant water quality parameters during and after water\n            treatment; to avoid dust, exhaust gases and noise, modern\n            machinery and periodic maintenance will be enforced during\n            construction phase; to keep high levels of population\n            health, some local water sources with questionable water\n            quality will be disconnected from the water supply network\n            after the RWSS completion; access roads to the construction\n            site will be adequately maintained, and regularly sprayed\n            with water to reduce propagation of dust; vehicles used for\n            transport of materials will be covered and regularly washed\n            to facilitate dust  prevention and cleaning; hunting and\n            disturbance of wildlife will be avoided; all solid waste\n            generated on the construction sites will be collected and\n            disposed at the appropriate city landfill; wood, paper,\n            glass, and plastic containers will be properly collected,\n            separated, stored and disposed at the sanitary landfill on\n            Podgorica; excess excavation material (soil) will be\n            transported and disposed to the local construction material\n            landfill;
