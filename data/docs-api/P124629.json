Some lessons learned\n            included: establishing a functioning donor coordination and\n            engagement mechanism is a key for effective project\n            monitoring and timely identification of problems. The GoR\n            has demonstrated a high level of commitment to statistical\n            development as witnessed by the increasing budget allocation\n            to the NISR and the presence of top government officials at\n            the NISR\u2019s outreach and dissemination events. This high\n            level of commitment kept pressure on the NISR to deliver in\n            a consistent and timely fashion. The SRF\u2019s alignment to a\n            nationally defined ambitious though realistic plan increased\n            the sense of ownership of the project and ensured that the\n            implementation of NSDS-1 amounted de facto to the\n            implementation of the SRF. In addition, the culture of\n            accountability and performance contracts within the\n            government meant that specific NISR staff members were\n            individually accountable for the implementation of\n            well-defined SRF activities, contributing to effective\n            implementation of the project. Finally, Bank teams need to\n            be realistic about the timeline for project implementation.\n            The too short timeline (25 months) that was originally\n            planned for implementation was one of the elements\n            warranting a project restructuring. Especially in cases\n            where the client has no prior experience in working with\n            Bank procedures and regulations, timelines need to be set\n            realistically as start-up delays will likely occur."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda -

As the poor almost uniquely depend on labor to\n            generate income, the strong reduction in poverty suggests\n            tangible improvements in employment outcomes over this\n            period. This jobs and employment study focuses on the recent\n            dynamics in Rwanda\u2019s jobs\u2019 landscape. Using data from a\n            variety of sources, mainly the three integrated households\n            living conditions surveys (EICV1, EICV2, and EICV3) and the\n            2011 establishment census, the report looks at what workers\n            in Rwanda are doing and what they are making, and how this\n            has changed over the past ten to fifteen years. Most of the\n            report focuses on the five years between 2006 and 2011,\n            although at times, the authors will also look at the\n            evolution since 2001. The report concludes with a number of\n            ideas to address Rwanda\u2019s jobs challenge in the near future."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Employment and jobs study"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda -

Poverty assessment : poverty\n            global practice - Africa region"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The last poverty assessment for Rwanda\n            was conducted in 1997. Three years after the genocide, the\n            country was characterized by deep and widespread poverty,\n            rock-bottom health indicators, and pervasive hunger and food\n            insecurity. In real terms, gross domestic product (GDP) per\n            capita was lower than it had been in 1960. In real terms,\n            the economy quadrupled between 1995 and 2013. Enrolment in\n            primary school is near universal and infant and child\n            mortality are among the lowest in Africa. A large part of\n            the population, including the extreme poor, is covered by\n            public health insurance. This poverty assessment focuses on\n            the evolution of poverty and other social indicators over\n            the past decade (2000-1 and 2010-11). Using data from a\n            variety of sources, mainly the three household living\n            standards surveys (EICV) and the three demographic and\n            health surveys (DHS) conducted during the past decade, the\n            poverty assessment documents trends in monetary and\n            non-monetary dimensions of living standards and examines the\n            drivers of observed trends. The aim of the poverty\n            assessment is to provide policy makers and development\n            partners with information and analysis that can be used to\n            improve the effectiveness of their poverty reduction and\n            social programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Poverty assessment : poverty global\n            practice - Africa
