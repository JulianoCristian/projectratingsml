as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: compliance with\n            environmental, social, and workplace health and safety\n            safeguards is often viewed with skepticism by borrowers. In\n            this case, however, incorporation of safeguards frameworks\n            into planning and design phases resulted in the PBA\n            incorporating several safeguards into their own processes\n            and procedures. Implementation of the water and sanitation\n            component and the drainage component was delayed somewhat\n            due to the need to ensure adequate organizational and\n            technical feasibility of investments. Implementation and\n            disbursement speed could have happened more quickly without\n            the additional technical reviews required by the Bank\n            supervision team, but would not have yielded the same\n            post-construction results, and, in particular, the technical\n            capacity strengthening of the implementing agencies.\n            Infrastructure lending in Argentina has generally been to\n            the national government, with sub-projects and benefits\n            often disbursed throughout the country. Working directly\n            with the PBA to identify and implement investments most\n            appropriate to the needs of the province provided an example\n            of the benefits of decentralized decision-making, with\n            investments better tailored to the needs identified by the\n            PBA. In addition, the size and scope of the APL1 and its\n            concentration within the PBA resulted in clear impacts:\n            improvements to the built environment, institutional\n            strengthening within the PBA and an increase in confidence\n            in the provincial government\u2019s capacity. The large pipeline\n            of projects financed by APL1 and APL2 succeeded in cementing\n            experience among staff that could then be used independently\n            of World Bank
