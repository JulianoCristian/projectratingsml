The overall outcome is assessed as satisfactory.\n            Overall, implementation was very good and the specific\n            objectives set for the project were achieved. Excellent\n            consultant input to the procurement and construction\n            supervision process ensured virtually trouble free\n            implementation of major infrastructure development on a\n            remote green field island site. Narrowly defined,\n            sustainability of this, the major component, is very likely.\n            Implementation of the technical assistance component was\n            varied, as is also the likelihood of sustainability.\n            Performance of the borrower and its agencies was\n            satisfactory; overall, government actions were generally\n            supportive, demonstrating full commitment to the project and\n            sector. Bank performance, while generally satisfactory, was\n            less so in identification and preparation, where the sector\n            strategy adopted was suboptimal. Partial export\n            liberalization in the sector, just prior to appraisal,\n            insufficiently accounted for in project design, had a\n            negative impact on the main project entity; but it vastly\n            improved income generation for beneficiaries as well as\n            overall sector efficiency. Positive lessons point to careful\n            selection of consultants, as well as the prior in-country\n            experience of these."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Maldives - Third Fisheries Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Maldives -

Fishing is the most\n            important primary activity in the Maldivian economy. In\n            order to maintain this industry, the project will: 1)\n            increase fish production, government revenue, and foreign\n            exchange earnings at a lower processing cost; 2) increase\n            the income of fishing households to alleviate relative\n            poverty; 3) reduce migration to the capital city, Male,\n            through balanced regional growth; and 4) create the\n            environment for increased private sector participation in\n            the fisheries sector. The Third Fisheries Project will meet\n            these goals by: 1) constructing a port at Kooddoo in Gaafu\n            Alifu in Southern Maldives for fishing boats and collector\n            vessels; 2) building a fish freezing/cold storage complex on\n            the same island; 3) strengthening the atoll wide fish\n            collection system; and 4) providing technical assistance.\n            These new improvements will help to strengthen the fishing\n            industry of Maldives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Maldives - Third Fisheries Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Maldives - Third Fisheries Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/11/735897/maldives-third-fisheries-project","projn":"MV-Fisheries III -- P004336","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Coastal and Marine Resources,Environmental Economics & Policies,Fishing Industry,Agricultural Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Maldives","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961001214959"},"subsc":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,Agricultural extension and research,Ports, waterways and shipping,Central government administration,Animal production","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,artisanal fisheries,artisanal\n            fishing,Audit Reports,Audits,brine,commodities,corporate\n            taxes,desalination,diet,economic activity,Economic\n            Analysis,economic development,economics,Economies of\n            scale,employment,Environmental\n            Management,equipment,exploitation,FAO,financial\n            management,financial reporting,financial resources,fish,fish\n            processing,fish production,fish products,fish\n            stocks,Fisheries,Fisheries Development,fisheries\n            sector,Fisherman,fishermen,fishery,fishery\n            policy,fishing,fishing boats,fishing fleet,fishing\n            grounds,fishing industry,fishing methods,Fishing\n            Operations,fishing techniques,fishing vessels,fishing\n            zones,fishmeal,housing,income,incomes,insurance,labor\n            force,landings,marine environment,market\n            prices,Marketing,Oil,OPEC,Organization of Petroleum\n            Exporting Countries,private sector,reef\n            fish,shark,sole,sustainable exploitation,Tuna,tuna\n            fisheries,UNDP,United Nations,United Nations Development\n            Programme,water temperature,weather patterns"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,artisanal fisheries,artisanal\n            fishing,Audit Reports,Audits,brine,commodities,corporate\n            taxes,desalination,diet,economic activity,Economic\n            Analysis,economic development,economics,Economies of\n            scale,employment,Environmental\n            Management,equipment,exploitation,FAO,financial\n            management,financial reporting,financial resources,fish,fish\n            processing,fish production,fish products,fish\n            stocks,Fisheries,Fisheries Development,fisheries\n            sector,Fisherman,fishermen,fishery,fishery\n            policy,fishing,fishing boats,fishing fleet,fishing\n            grounds,fishing industry,fishing methods,Fishing\n            Operations,fishing techniques,fishing vessels,fishing\n            zones,fishmeal,housing,income,incomes,insurance,labor\n            force,landings,marine environment,market\n            prices,Marketing,Oil,OPEC,Organization of Petroleum\n            Exporting Countries,private sector,reef\n            fish,shark,sole,sustainable exploitation,Tuna,tuna\n            fisheries,UNDP,United Nations,United Nations Development\n            Programme,water temperature,weather patterns"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"9880"},"facets":{}}}
