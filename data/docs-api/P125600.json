Some lessons learned included: the results\n            framework is intended to set clearly articulated targets for\n            outcomes that the project is expected to achieve over time,\n            and which can be periodically measured to indicate to what\n            extent the targets have been achieved. For the very early\n            stages of recovery community-administered cash-for-work\n            programs may be more appropriate, and adequate flexibility\n            should be built into the project design to adapt to this. It\n            will be useful to explore options under the new village law\n            that can provide some flexibility during times of officially\n            declared disasters. Special strategies are needed to ensure\n            that adequate resources are available to reflect real\n            scarcity and high costs, including the cost of good\n            facilitation. The disaster management law and the village\n            law can be mutually supportive in these areas, and good\n            community participation as part of the annual process can\n            help provide pro-active risk reduction and disaster\n            management strategies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
