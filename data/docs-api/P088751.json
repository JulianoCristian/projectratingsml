Some lessons learned included: the\n            many changes in indicators, including wording, targets and\n            completely new indicators added over the course of the\n            restructuring and AFs added much complexity to monitoring\n            and evaluating the project progress. Better documentation on\n            progress on these indicators and more realistic assessment\n            before changing targets would have simplified subsequent\n            assessments. The gender-based violence pilot in a\n            non-conflict region is a good example of making funds\n            available and contracting out a pilot in a theme-area that\n            was not recognized as an urgent issue. The pilot managed by\n            UNFPA was very successful and will be scaled up in the next\n            project. The PBF pilot is another example of how the\n            project, with leveraged funds, introduced a new approach to\n            financing the system. The pilot was evaluated and produced\n            results that confirmed that Results-Based Financing (RBF)\n            could work in DRC. Many of the lessons and findings of this\n            pilot are also included in the new health project, which\n            will scale up and implement the PBF approach nationally. The\n            project was started with the purpose to rebuild a\n            deteriorated health sector. The approach to rebuilding at\n            the time, in a very weak environment, was to focus on\n            getting the vertical service delivery functional again. In\n            the ten-year implementation period, the situation evolved\n            and the importance of not only rebuilding the basic services\n            at the local level but also the system itself, became\n            important. The project, with the help of the Trust Funds,\n            initiated some work on strengthening the health system, in\n            the areas of health financing and financing mechanisms, but\n            much more remains to be done. The project provides many\n            lessons to be taken on in the new operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo, Democratic Republic of - Health\n            Sector Rehabilitation Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo, Democratic Republic of -\n            Health Sector Rehabilitation Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2015/10/25475801/congo-democratic-republic-health-sector-rehabilitation-support-project","topic":"Health Economics and Finance m1326577 625,Health Care Performance Indicators\n            m1327298 1321,Health Benefits m1327439 1607,Health Care Resource Allocation m1326825 628","projn":"ZR-Drc  Health Sector Rehabilitation Support\n            Project -- P088751","subtopic":"Population Policies,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Housing & Human Habitats,Disease Control & Prevention,Health Systems Development & Reform","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0831e88e9_1_0"},"theme":"Malaria,Population and reproductive health,Health system performance,Child health,HIV/AIDS","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Health Economics and Finance m1326577 625,Health Care Performance Indicators\n            m1327298 1321,Health Benefits m1327439 1607,Health Care Resource Allocation m1326825 628","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"health care providers, health information\n            system, waste, child health, communities, risks, health\n            service delivery, reproductive health, personality,\n            vaccination, financing, financial management, income,\n            antenatal care, deaths, health expenditures, calories,\n            doctors, morbidity, international organizations, basic\n            health services, community health, primary care, services,\n            malaria control, health care, integrated management of\n            childhood illnesses, incentives, health, health\n            professionals, projects, project, health facilities, public\n            health, life expectancy, health conditions, knowledge,\n            health sector, finance management, choice, cost\n            effectiveness, health status, costs, training, immunization,\n            intervention, high fertility, health costs, probability,\n            health indicators, health systems, preventive treatment,\n            health centers, health system performance, rape, community\n            health services, health care services, health management,\n            violence, access to health services, debt, allocative\n            efficiency, human resources management, hospital care,\n            essential health care, health organization, work\n            environment, hiv/aids, poliomyelitis, polio vaccine,\n            mortality, health administration, health information,\n            design, health systems management, infant mortality, equity,\n            diphtheria, food security, workers, public health\n            expenditures, contraceptives, social services, health\n            systems strengthening, surveillance, immunodeficiency, care,\n            gender, demand, health outcomes, victims, household, family\n            planning, medical equipment, expenditures, social science,\n            decision making, health care financing, nutrition, beds,\n            health care expenditures, workshops, primary health care,\n            burden of disease, waste disposal, risk factors, health\n            results, health system, pregnant women, essential drugs,\n            children, disease control, clinics, working conditions,\n            evaluation, human resources, households, equality, rural\n            areas, poverty, integration, health expenditure, illness,\n            cooperation, incidence, infants, counseling, rehabilitation,\n            population, facilities, polio, interventions, community,\n            strategy, fees, child health services, health financing,\n            health projects, sexual violence, hospitals, health\n            interventions, health service, female, health services,\n            implementation, pregnancy, service, districts, health system\n            strengthening, health strategy, displaced persons, human\n            development, primary health care services"}},"owner":"Health, Nutr & Population -

The restructuring\n            paper for the Congo, Democratic Republic of, Health Sector\n            Rehabilitation Support Project (PARSS), DRC intends to\n            extend the closing date of the project from June 30, 2014 to\n            December 31, 2014. This current closing date extension\n            request is necessary as the Government expressed a strong\n            desire to be given enough time to complete their piloting of\n            the Performance Based Financing (PBF) in the 84 health zones\n            covered by the project which after 6 months of\n            implementation has already started to show good results in\n            terms of increased utilization and improvement of quality of\n            care.  An additional 6 months will also enable them to lay\n            out the plans for a potential scale up to additional health\n            zones. It will enable the Government to pilot full alignment\n            and harmonization of interventions among key partners in the\n            field such as UNICEF initially and Global Fund as well as\n            Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) who are\n            keen to \u2018piggy-back\u2019 on the Bank\u2019s PBF strategy to support\n            health system strengthening.  Ongoing dialogue with these\n            partners indicate that they would align their activities and\n            funding to the 84 health zones of the current project as a\n            pilot phase with a scale up to potentially 169 health zones\n            in 2015-2018 as part of the new WB-funded project. In\n            addition, a new financing through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund\n            for Health Results Innovation in the amount of 10 million\n            dollars will be finalized shortly in order to finance this\n            scale-up and alignment of activities.
