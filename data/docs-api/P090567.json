Some lessons learned includes:\n            political environment and public sector reform approach:\n            public sector reforms are inherently political and their\n            design and implementation has to be informed by a careful\n            and ongoing political economy (PE) analysis. Fiscal roles of\n            the branches of government and among different levels of\n            government are clearly defined in law and practice. Public\n            sector and governance reforms affect various interests and\n            often face resistance. The design, however, may have\n            underestimated the implementation challenges inherent in\n            managing such a complex program. While the project design\n            adequately identified high level leadership is key to\n            successful project implementation, effective leadership at\n            component and

Institutional Reform and Capacity\n            Building Technical Assistance Project for Kenya aims to\n            strengthen public financial management systems to enhance\n            their transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to\n            public expenditure policy priorities as well as to enhance\n            public service delivery. Public financial management systems\n            will be strengthened through the effective implementation of\n            Results Based Management. There are three project\n            components, the first of which comprises several\n            sub-components. Component 1, Budget and Public Financial\n            Management, strengthens budget formulation; budget\n            execution, accounting, and financial reporting; public\n            financial management through the use of information\n            technology; the external and internal audit systems; the\n            national procurement system, and revenue and collection and\n            management for the Kenya Revenue Authority; and provides\n            support to key Parliamentary Committees for effective\n            oversight of public financial management. Component 2,\n            Capacity Building for \"Results for Kenyans,\"\n            provides capacity support to five key ministries--Finance,\n            Agriculture, Planning and Development, Trade and Industry,\n            and Local Government; and focuses on enhancing the change\n            management capacity of leaders in the Public Service and\n            their teams in delivering 'Results for Kenyans'.\n            It will also enhance the development and promotion of a\n            value system and code of ethics developed from the existing\n            legislation as well as best global practice as a tool to\n            rejuvenate the service orientation and accountability for\n            public servants. It will build on a pilot program underway\n            on changing the ethos and practices of the leaders to be\n            more effective in transforming the public service in support\n            of the Economic Recovery Strategy, especially in leading\n            teams to accept and implement Results Based Management as\n            the main vehicle for driving reforms (Transformative\n            Leadership and Ethics for Results Based Management).\n            Component 3 will finance technical support and capacity for\n            project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -
