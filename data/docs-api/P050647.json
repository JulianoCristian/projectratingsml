Some lessons learned includes: due to the high\n            sedimentation it is not possible to operate the system at\n            full design flow, particularly during rainy weather when\n            silt loads are high, to minimize the deposition of silt in\n            the canals. Operation at full supply level will enable\n            canals and field channels with inlets at comparatively high\n            levels to receive their designed flow rate. This issue of\n            sedimentation begins at the head of the feeder canal and a\n            solution must be taken up, along with the other investments\n            if the problem is to be systemically fixed. Good linkages\n            between agriculture investments (often carried out by the\n            Department of Agriculture) and irrigation and drainage\n            investments (by UP Irrigation Department, or UPID) will\n            improve agricultural productivity. One way of improving this\n            will be to have at least one agricultural officer in each\n            Participatory irrigation management (PIM) cell in UPID\n            district offices. During the design stage it is critical to\n            get the input of farmers to understand the current system of\n            both formal and informal outlets within a minor. The\n            technical designs should be discussed by outlet committees\n            and the farmers should debate the trade-offs in order to\n            come to agreement for how the minor will be operated. This\n            will decrease the risk that illegal cuts will be made after\n            the designs are implemented, which in turn compromise the\n            ability of the system to deliver the proper allocation of\n            water to all the outlets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Uttar Pradesh Water Sector\n            Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India -

objectives of the Uttar\n            Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring Project for India are to:\n            a) set up an enabling institutional and policy framework for\n            water sector reform in the state for integrated water\n            resources management; and b) initiate irrigation and\n            drainage sub-sector reforms in the state to increase and\n            stain water and agricultural productivity. The project\n            helped the state create one of the first state-level water\n            resources agencies in India, as well as a state water\n            resources regulator. Their mandate covers all water-using\n            sectors including the irrigation sub-sector. The project\n            helped provide technical assistance and support to provide a\n            legal basis for Water User Associations (WUA) and held WUA\n            elections. Recommendations of a detailed institutional study\n            on one of the oldest departments in India the Uttar Pradesh\n            Irrigation Department (UPID, with about 100,000 employees)\n            was conducted as part of the project and adopted by the\n            Government of UP. An integrated planning decision support\n            system and strategic basin environmental and social\n            assessment were conducted for the overall Ghagra-Gomti basin\n            in eastern UP to improve a more holistic consideration of\n            basin issues in planning. Computers and an enterprise\n            management system were introduced into the UPID. Irrigation\n            and drainage systems were rehabilitated in the pilot Jaunpur\n            Branch basin using modern surveys (one of the largest in the\n            country) and designs to provide a template for modernizing\n            the 12 million hectares of surface irrigated land served by UPID."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Uttar Pradesh Water\n            Sector Restructuring Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/08/12726034/india-uttar-pradesh-water-sector-restructuring-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"IN-Uttar Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring\n            Project -- P050647","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Water Use,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Supply and Systems,Town Water Supply and Sanitation","teratopic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20100902233634"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Sub-national government administration,Renewable energy,Other social services,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural intensification,agricultural\n            production,allocation of water,Basin Development,basin\n            water,bilateral cooperation,Canals,Capacity\n            Building,community involvement,community\n            priorities,conjunctive use,Cost Benefit Analysis,cost\n            recovery,cost-recovery,covering,delivery of\n            water,Drainage,drainage operation,Drainage\n            Operations,drainage systems,drinking water,effective\n            use,employment,engineering,environmental\n            issues,Environmental Management,environmental\n            protection,equity in distribution,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,financial resources,flood control,flood\n            damages,floods,ground water,groundwater,groundwater\n            exploitation,groundwater resources,Hydro\n            Development,income,income levels,investment\n            program,Irrigation,Irrigation Management,irrigation\n            services,irrigation systems,land degradation,Land\n            Reclamation,management of water,managing water\n            resources,National Water Policy,Natural\n            Resources,operational management,Participatory Irrigation\n            Management,performance indicators,pollution,Poor water\n            quality,population growth,poverty line,private sector\n            operator,productivity,Rainwater,Rainwater\n            Harvesting,resource allocation,river basin,river\n            basins,rivers,rural water,rural water supply,scarce\n            water,scarce water resources,sectoral reforms,sectoral\n            Water,service provider,sources of water,stakeholder\n            involvement,supply of water,surface water,sustainable\n            development,sustainable water,tariff setting,tradable water\n            rights,village ponds,water,water allocation,Water\n            Board,water bodies,water charges,water logging,water\n            management,Water Policy,water quality,water resource,water\n            resource management,Water Resources,water resources\n            development,water resources management,water resources\n            planning,water rights,water scarcity,Water Sector,water\n            sector reform,water services,water sources,water\n            supply,Water Tariff,water transport,Water use,Water\n            User,Water User Association,water user associations,WUAWater\n            resources conservation;

and b) initiate irrigation and\n            drainage sub-sector reforms in the state to increase and\n            stain water and agricultural productivity. The project\n            helped the state create one of the first state-level water\n            resources agencies in India, as well as a state water\n            resources regulator. Their mandate covers all water-using\n            sectors including the irrigation sub-sector. The project\n            helped provide technical assistance and support to provide a\n            legal basis for Water User Associations (WUA) and held WUA\n            elections. Recommendations of a detailed institutional study\n            on one of the oldest departments in India the Uttar Pradesh\n            Irrigation Department (UPID, with about 100,000 employees)\n            was conducted as part of the project and adopted by the\n            Government of UP. An integrated planning decision support\n            system and strategic basin environmental and social\n            assessment were conducted for the overall Ghagra-Gomti basin\n            in eastern UP to improve a more holistic consideration of\n            basin issues in planning. Computers and an enterprise\n            management system were introduced into the UPID. Irrigation\n            and drainage systems were rehabilitated in the pilot Jaunpur\n            Branch basin using modern surveys (one of the largest in the\n            country) and designs to provide a template for modernizing\n            the 12 million hectares of surface irrigated land served by UPID."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Uttar Pradesh Water\n            Sector Restructuring Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/08/12726035/india-uttar-pradesh-water-sector-restructuring-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"IN-Uttar Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring\n            Project -- P050647","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Water Use,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Supply and Systems,Town Water Supply and Sanitation","teratopic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20100902234214"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Sub-national government administration,Renewable energy,Other social services,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural intensification,agricultural\n            production,allocation of water,Basin Development,basin\n            water,bilateral cooperation,Canals,Capacity\n            Building,community involvement,community\n            priorities,conjunctive use,Cost Benefit Analysis,cost\n            recovery,cost-recovery,covering,delivery of\n            water,Drainage,drainage operation,Drainage\n            Operations,drainage systems,drinking water,effective\n            use,employment,engineering,environmental\n            issues,Environmental Management,environmental\n            protection,equity in distribution,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,financial resources,flood control,flood\n            damages,floods,ground water,groundwater,groundwater\n            exploitation,groundwater resources,Hydro\n            Development,income,income levels,investment\n            program,Irrigation,Irrigation Management,irrigation\n            services,irrigation systems,land degradation,Land\n            Reclamation,management of water,managing water\n            resources,National Water Policy,Natural\n            Resources,operational management,Participatory Irrigation\n            Management,performance indicators,pollution,Poor water\n            quality,population growth,poverty line,private sector\n            operator,productivity,Rainwater,Rainwater\n            Harvesting,resource allocation,river basin,river\n            basins,rivers,rural water,rural water supply,scarce\n            water,scarce water resources,sectoral reforms,sectoral\n            Water,service provider,sources of water,stakeholder\n            involvement,supply of water,surface water,sustainable\n            development,sustainable water,tariff setting,tradable water\n            rights,village ponds,water,water allocation,Water\n            Board,water bodies,water charges,water logging,water\n            management,Water Policy,water quality,water resource,water\n            resource management,Water Resources,water resources\n            development,water resources management,water resources\n            planning,water rights,water scarcity,Water Sector,water\n            sector reform,water services,water sources,water\n            supply,Water Tariff,water transport,Water use,Water\n            User,Water User Association,water user associations,WUAWater\n            resources conservation;
