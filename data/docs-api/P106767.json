The state government was able\n            to turn its finances around from a negative operating\n            balance to a positive figure of 1,497 million dollars and\n            increased investments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - South of Rio Grande do Sul changes\n            in financial position"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"A fiscal turnaround in Brazil\u2019s\n            state of Rio Grande do Sul : Brazil - South of Rio Grande do\n            Sul changes in financial position"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/04/25082639/fiscal-turnaround-brazil\u2019s-state-rio-grande-sul-brazil-south-rio-grande-sul-changes-financial-position","topic":"Finance and Growth m1327404 1081,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Financial Capability m1327248 1255,Financial Risk Reduction m1327140 1973,Financial Risk Management m1326072 375","projn":"BR-Rio Grande Do Sul Fiscal Sustainability\n            -- P106767","docty":"Brief","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0830fdd96_1_0"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Debt management and fiscal sustainability,Other public sector governance,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","colti":"Results profile","lang":"Chinese","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Finance and Growth m1327404 1081,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Financial Capability m1327248 1255,Financial Risk Reduction m1327140 1973,Financial Risk Management m1326072 375","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Finance","majdocty":"Publications & Research","owner":"Governance - GP (GGODR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Development Policy Lending"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"majtheme":"Economic management,Public sector governance","repnb":"94065"},"15380782":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/05/15380782/brazil-rio-grande-sul-fiscal-sustainability-growth-program-development-policy-loan-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/05/15380782/brazil-rio-grande-sul-fiscal-sustainability-growth-program-development-policy-loan-project","new_url":"2011/05/15380782/brazil-rio-grande-sul-fiscal-sustainability-growth-program-development-policy-loan-project","disclosure_date":"2011-10-26T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2011-10-26T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2011-10-26T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/10/28/000333037_20111028013455/Rendered/INDEX/ICR19260P1067600disclosed0100260110.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/10/28/000333037_20111028013455/Rendered/PDF/ICR19260P1067600disclosed0100260110.pdf","loan_no":"7584","docdt":"2011-05-20T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2011-10-28T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Rio Grande Do Sul Fiscal\n            Sustainability for Growth Program Development Policy Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Rio Grande Do Sul (RS)\n            Fiscal Sustainability for Growth Program Development Policy\n            Loan (DPL) Project for Mexico were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. The lesson\n            highlights the importance of the debt restructuring\n            operation among the fiscal consolidation measures behind the\n            fiscal turnaround in RS. The restructuring not only saved\n            budgetary resources, but was also a key to smoothing the\n            debt service profile in 2009 and 2010, at a time when the\n            global economic crisis increased uncertainty and rollover\n            risks worldwide. The improved profile also facilitated the\n            task of budget planning. The debt restructuring was thus of\n            paramount significance to the state and spurred a new demand\n            from sub-national clients willing to engage in fiscal\n            consolidation operations with debt restructuring components\n            with the Bank. A political economy lesson can also be drawn.\n            The loan supported reforms aimed at addressing structural\n            fiscal imbalances. However, undertaking such reforms\n            requires strong social coalitions. These coalitions in turn\n            take a relatively long time to build while the DPL\n            instrument is short-lived. In this sense, the DPL merit was\n            at least to help build the needed coalition by bringing up\n            the issue. The submission of a new draft law on pension\n            reform by the new Government is suggestive that this DPL may\n            have contributed to building a consensus around this issue.\n            Finally, the timing of the loan suited very well the\n            state's needs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Rio Grande Do Sul Fiscal\n            Sustainability for Growth Program Development

The proceeds of the loan will\n            used to restructure part of the state's debts and\n            smooth its debt servicing profile. It will provide financial\n            support at a critical juncture, as a new administration\n            pursues policies to reverse a non-sustainable fiscal\n            position. The operation is also a priority for the Federal\n            Government, since it will enhance compliance by the state\n            with the federal Fiscal Responsibility Law. The program\n            supported by this operation is broad based and reflects a\n            commitment to a multi-year process of reforms.The actions\n            include, among others, a rationalization of expenditures,\n            improving tax collection efficiency, limiting the use of tax\n            expenditures, improving fiscal and debt management systems,\n            restructuring of the state's debt, reforming the social\n            security system, modernizing public sector management,\n            reorganizing the civil service, and improving the provision\n            of public services. The DPL is multi-tranched in order to\n            support policy continuity. The disbursement of the first\n            tranche would be made on the basis of actions already\n            implemented.
