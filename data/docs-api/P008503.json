Lessons highlight\n            primarily the importance of project ownership, and effective\n            management, actions which proved critical in accelerating\n            the slow pace of implementation, by ensuring that qualified\n            staff and consultants move the project towards successful\n            development objectives. While the autonomy of the\n            participating financial institutions (PFIs) in the selection\n            of subprojects was conducive to a sound loan portfolio\n            (based on a commercially driven criteria), this however, led\n            indirectly to the high dominance of large borrowers, at an\n            advantage over the smaller ones, in the ability to present\n            adequate collateral, and economies of scale. Thus, in order\n            to broaden the scale of rural lending, gaps in lending to\n            smaller, underserved rural clients needs to be further\n            analyzed; possibly, supporting microfinance, through\n            non-bank financial institutions. Moreover, public\n            information campaigns, technical assistance, and training\n            should be further emphasized so as to enhance credit\n            operational sustainability, and the capacity of PFIs, in\n            order to lower the high risk, and costs perceived in rural\n            lending. Similarly, although services to rural clients in\n            the preparation of their business plans, training, and\n            seminars were conducted free of charge, emphasis should\n            focus on the need to determine, and establish a financing\n            mechanism for these capacity building activities, to foster\n            long-term sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan -

The program will include three phases. The first\n            phase will focus on the legal framework, the institutions,\n            and the procedures to support improved performance of rural\n            enterprises and stimulate the flow of commercial bank\n            financing to enterprises. The second phase will build on the\n            first phase by expanding the coverage of the advisory\n            services. The third phase will expand the program on a\n            nation-wide basis. There are four components in this\n            project. First, the rural advisory centers component will\n            strengthen information for farm shareholders on shareholder\n            rights, build local business support infrastructure to\n            deliver advice and training on technical and commercial\n            practices, and increase local capacity for the provision of\n            advice. Second, the credit component will finance private\n            farms and associated agri-businesses through participating\n            financial institutions (PFIs). Third, the institutional\n            development component will facilitate secured lending by\n            developing procedures for using moveable property as\n            collateral for bank lending; and creditor-led restructuring\n            through capacity building in the PFI's on procedures\n            for debt work-out, bankruptcy and liquidation. The fourth\n            component will assist in the establishment of a Project\n            Implementation Unit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan - Agricultural Post Privatization\n
