The implementing agency (AGETIP) demonstrated\n            that it could deliver cost-effective civil works through\n            efficient and transparent delegated contract management\n            procedures, while generating substantial employment and\n            receiving no external technical assistance. Key lessons\n            learned are summed up as follows: The sustainability of\n            sub-projects and the survival of many of the small and\n            medium-size construction firms (SMEs) created during project\n            implementation hinges on the delivery of quality works and\n            services. New training workshops in standard design and\n            supervision procedures for consultants need to be run.\n            Strengthening training packages in general management, site\n            management, and tender preparation will be important for\n            contractors. Improving the systematic collection of labor\n            and income-related data on SMEs in the local private sector\n            constitutes an important next step toward assessing the\n            poverty alleviation effects of employment-generating\n            interventions in the public works area. Strengthening\n            municipal capacities is a key to ensuring sub-project\n            sustainability; sub-projects will struggle as long as local\n            governments falter in developing technical and managerial\n            capacity for long-term investment programming and in\n            improved tax collection. The Bank should clearly state that\n            the agency's operating costs will be financed in the\n            future on a declining basis, as the agency moves toward a\n            fee-for-service system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gambia -

The project has three\n            main components. The first component is an investment\n            component aimed at protecting the existing infrastructure\n            from decay and developing additional urgently needed social\n            infrastructure. The program of labor intensive subprojects\n            includes two types of operations: (a) public works including\n            routine maintenance of roads, rehabilitation of drainage\n            system; and urban infrastructure; and (b) public services,\n            notably cleaning up spoiled urban areas as well as testing\n            private management practices of waste collection. The second\n            component is capacity building through training and\n            technical support for the beneficiaries and small- and\n            medium-sized enterprises aimed at: (a) enhancing the\n            technical capacity of domestic construction contractors and\n            local consultants; (b) improving the management of public\n            infrastructure by local governments, and emphasizing\n            maintenance of new construction; and (c) improving public\n            procurements and contract management practices. The third\n            component is a study component aimed at defining more\n            broadly-based improvements in the urban infrastructure\n            maintenance management; and the private sector participation\n            as a support of the project in general and the preparation\n            of the urban environment project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gambia -
