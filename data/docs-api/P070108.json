Some\n            lessons learned included: an operation aiming to support the\n            implementation of a major sector reform should include\n            milestones for effective policy implementation, specific\n            provisions or instruments for high level policy dialogue\n            with government authorities and/or mitigation measures in\n            case of delayed or inadequate implementation of the policy\n            or law. This would be particularly relevant in cases where\n            the law has been recently passed, and there are\n            uncertainties about the potential for satisfactory\n            implementation of the legal or regulatory framework. Where\n            the sector consists of a large number of entities which are\n            poorly performing and most likely need to be merged or\n            liquidated, the political ramifications emanating from\n            liquidation could easily jeopardize the sector consolidation\n            process, and where supported, the process could be painful\n            and time-consuming, and the use of internationally reputed\n            consultants could impart transparency and credibility to the\n            process. In order to reach low-income households where\n            literacy rates are low and functional literacy is\n            practically nonexistent, efforts need to be made in the area\n            of social intermediation. Awareness raising and assistance\n            at the community level are therefore essential to improve\n            the likelihood of successful access to rural financial

for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n            provided support to the Government of Mexico to strengthen\n            the savings, credit and financial cooperative sector, and to\n            improve the reach and range of financial services to the\n            poor, particularly those in remote areas or from\n            marginalized populations. As a result, 70 percent of the\n            sector (in assets and membership) is now served by\n            institutions that are certified and supervised. 440,000\n            people in rural and marginal areas, of which 53 percent were\n            women, gained access to financial services. Since this first\n            project, IBRD has approved two additional phases bringing\n            total IBRD financing to approximately United States (U.S.)\n            340 million dollars. This additional support is helping to\n            scale up operations, increase outreach by another 2.3\n            million people in rural and marginal areas, and pilot and\n            roll out

It relates to\n            the first stage additional financing project. The project\n            development objective and design of the Secretaria de\n            Agricultura, Ganaderia, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y\n            Alimentacion (SAGARPA) component continue to be relevant,\n            and remain fundamentally unaltered for the purposes of the\n            additional financing loan. The scale and geographic scope of\n            the SAGARPA component, however, are expanded for the\n            additional financing loan. The SAGARPA component of the\n            Phase I project aims at promoting secure and sustainable\n            financial services in rural marginal areas, through\n            specialized technical assistance and training. There are\n            four main reasons for scaling up this component: (a)\n            uniqueness of the component and the approach to its\n            implementation; (b) highly successful implementation\n            performance and satisfactory development outcome; (c) need\n            to expand the limited initial geographical coverage; and (d)\n            strong government
