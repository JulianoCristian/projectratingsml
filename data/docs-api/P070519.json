Some lessons learned\n            includes: project preparation for urban transport projects\n            should account for lengthy land acquisition and resettlement\n            activities. Land acquisitions and resettlement activities\n            constituted the main challenge to the timely implementation\n            of the project. High-impact outcomes can be leveraged from\n            the preparation and implementation of Bank safeguards. As\n            part of the preliminary background analysis for the\n            preparation of the project's environmental safeguards,\n            the high ecological value of the regional wetlands was\n            identified, and two project investments that were\n            detrimental to this ecosystem were dropped. The Monitoring\n            and Evaluation (M&E) framework should be designed in a\n            way that the achievement of outcome can be easily assessed.\n            One of the project's outcome indicators was the\n            adoption of initiatives to improve planning and built\n            environment in Nantai Island from Technical Assistance (TA)\n            activities, such as the adoption of new urban design\n            guidelines, actions to preserve historic areas, or zoning\n            regulations based on specific functional specifications."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
