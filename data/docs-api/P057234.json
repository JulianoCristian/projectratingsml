The use of\n            demand-driven approaches for forestry or natural resources\n            management activities may be constrained by insufficient\n            demand, as communities often have other priorities. Small\n            grant monitoring that narrowly focuses on ensuring that\n            grant monies were used for their intended purpose is\n            insufficient to demonstrate outcome level results and is a\n            lost opportunity for learning.

Some lessons learned\n            included: sustainable forest sector reforms require strong\n            political and technical leadership. Reforms also need to be\n            in line with government priorities. Transparency in the\n            consultative process ensures that staff/employees, at all\n            levels, feel ownership and consider change as an opportunity\n            rather than a threat to their livelihood. Projects\n            implemented during times of significant policy change\n            require enhanced, constant engagement and supervision. This\n            includes utilizing outside expertise with strong in-country\n            experience, mobilizing senior Bank management, and ensuring\n            flexibility in the design to respond to changes in\n            priorities while retaining the overall goals. Forest sector\n            projects tend to be overly ambitious, aiming to address\n            multiple challenges (e.g. sector reform, sustainable\n            management, governance, community participation, etc.) in a\n            single operation. Recipient implementation capacity is often\n            insufficient to address existing complexities within the\n            given timeframe and limited resources are spread too thinly.\n            As a consequence, restructuring is often required to adjust\n            ambitious project designs to realities on the ground,\n            helping to achieve a few tangible results. So as to yield\n            sustainable project outcomes, project designs should be more\n            focused, allocating sufficient and targeted financial resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania -

The Eastern Arc component was appraised\n            separately from the main project due to timing of the GEF\n            approval process, which has necessitated the separate\n            processing of  the grant component. This third component of\n            the program, which is largely to be financed by GEF (and\n            possibly with bilateral  sources) has been jointly developed\n            and implemented by the World Bank and UNDP working with\n            Government and other partners with interests in the forestry\n            sector. This component will support  institutional reform,\n            strategy development, pilot community-based conservation,\n            and the development of   sustainable financing for tropical\n            high forest conservation in Tanzania. The main global\n            environmental objective of  this GEF activity is  to promote\n            the sustainable conservation  and management of  the Eastem\n            Arc forests. The activity has four sub-components:\n            subcomponent (i)  will be implemented by the World Bank with\n            IDA resources; subcomponent (ii) will also be implemented\n            by the World Bank with GEF grant resources; sub-components\n            (iii) and (iv) will be implemented through  UNDP with GEF\n            grant resources. Subcomponent 1 finances institutional\n            reforms for forest biodiversity conservation, in particular\n            of the Eastern Arc  forests at central, district and local\n            partnership levels to incorporate specific responsibilities\n            for  biodiversity conservation, oversight, monitoring and\n            coordination. Such reforms will be linked  with other\n            reforms and institutional restructuring proposed for the\n            forestry sector as a whole,  which are to be financed by\n            IDA. The implementing agency for this sub-component would be\n            the Bank. In subcomponent 2, mechanisms for sustainable\n            financing of biodiversity conservation will be developed\n            including the establishment of  the Eastem Arc Mountains\n            Conservation Endowment Fund  (EAMCEF). It   is  envisaged\n            that a pilot endowment trust fund will be established by the\n            project,  with GEF resources.

The project is not expected to result in\n            significant negative environmental or social impacts. The\n            project supports the implementation of a series of\n            participatory forestry management activities. Provisions\n            will be made to bring about sound forest management, and\n            when required, the preservation of critical biodiversity\n            habitats. In particular, areas classified as catchment\n            forest that are important for watershed protection and the\n            Eastern Arc Montane Forest will be targeted for priority\n            protection and conservation. Environmental risks are\n            associated with well-known and documented forest management\n            constraints--encroachment into forest reserves, difficulties\n            in implementing practical sustainable forest management\n            plans and sometimes ineffective traditional government\n            forest management policies and regulatory measures. Social\n            and economic impacts will be assessed for all plantation\n            forests which are expected to be directly affected by the\n            component involving the private sector in managing\n            industrial forest plantations. Consultation will be taken\n            with all stakeholders. Special attention will be directed at\n            small sawmillers to ensure they are adequately protected\n            during project implementation. An added benefit to involving\n            the private sector is that creating expanded business\n            climate could introduce new sawmilling technologies that\n            would use discarded
