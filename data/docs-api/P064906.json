Some lessons learned\n            included: bottom-up and demand-driven initiatives can\n            improve the quality and relevance of social and economic\n            investments. Community Driven Development Projects (CDD)\n            must be integrated with local government programs rather\n            than by-pass them in order to ensure long-term\n            sustainability of the small-scale social and economic\n            investments carried out at the community level, provide\n            enabling conditions for the scaling up and prevent erosion\n            of local capacity. The choice of targeting approach is\n            relevant for equity, transparency, program ownership and\n            effectiveness. The Nicaraguan State needs to significantly\n            strengthen its coordinating efforts among line Ministries\n            and agencies to increase effectiveness and efficiencies in a\n            context of limited financial, physical and technical\n            resources. Impact evaluation included at the onset of\n            project implementation and monitoring are needed as a means\n            to correct course if it becomes necessary. They also provide\n            appropriate information to test alternative mechanisms,\n            prior to scaling-up. This project paid close attention to\n            establishing a functional Management Information System\n            (MIS) and a series of evaluations. Ensuring implementation\n            readiness conditions prior to negotiations leads to a more\n            effective and timely physical and financial execution cycle."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua

      by partially implementing the poverty reduction strategy,\n            and by continuing to improve access to small-scale social,\n            and economic infrastructure to the poor. The components\n            include: 1) subproject financing, to enable a continued\n            support from the Emergency Social Investment Fund (FISE), in\n            the replacement, expansion, and improvement of basic social\n            services. Training in community organization, operations,\n            and maintenance will be provided. The component aims at\n            improving the quality, and comprehensiveness of investments;\n            ensuring community participation; coordinating with service\n            providers to ensure adequate supply-side interventions; and,\n            addressing the specific needs of indigenous populations; 2)\n            financing of participatory municipal planning, which\n            includes technical assistance (TA), and training provision\n            for communities, and municipalities alike, so as to be able\n            to conduct future planning by themselves. Decentralization\n            of subproject management will continue, through TA from\n            FISE, while capacity building will be provided not only to\n            communities, and municipalities, but to private\n            stakeholders; 3) supporting the development of safety nets\n            within a strengthened social protection strategy, and\n            improved management of public investments in social areas,\n            including monitoring and evaluation of safety net programs.\n            An innovation fund will be established within FISE to pilot\n            safety net measures for poverty reduction; and, 4) project\n            management covering institutional strengthening, supply of\n            equipment, and external
