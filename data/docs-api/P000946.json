Ratings for the\n            Natural Resources Management Project were as follows:\n            outcome was unsatisfactory; risk to the development outcome\n            was significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included from the project: it is essential to gauge\n            support at higher levels of government than the concerned\n            environmental agencies. Care has to be taken that\n            international environmental pressure, vested interests and\n            the understandable enthusiasm of the Bank's own\n            appraisal process does not lead to financing of worthy\n            causes that governments are unwilling to support. Care has\n            to be taken that individuals and community stakeholders are\n            empowered in the decision-making process, particularly over\n            allocation of rights to utilize natural resources. The\n            assessed projects clearly show that insecure property rights\n            allied with centralized, top-down award of concessions to\n            commercial operations and capture of economic rents creates\n            conflict and promotes non-sustainable natural resource\n            utilization. When partners operate on differing schedules\n            and priorities there is a danger that mixed signals will be\n            passed to the in-country stakeholders. In that respect\n            common pool budget support mechanisms have a strategic\n            advantage in bringing coherence to reform agendas.\n            Insufficient attention to addressing the causes of rural\n            poverty drives people to live off the environmental commons\n            where short-term survival interests typically outweigh\n            consideration of longer-term stability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Environmental Resource Management\n            Project: GEF Coastal Wetlands Management Project; Natural\n            Resources Management

Several lessons were learned from this\n            project. A lesson learnt is that to achieve the benefits of\n            a partnership with donors, it is essential that joint\n            financing be sought. Other mechanisms of funding should be\n            explored that ensure that funds come in simultaneously and\n            well before implementation e.g., basket funding. Overly\n            Ambitious Project Designs are a stumbling block to\n            implementation:   It is important to ensure that the natural\n            resource goals of the project are well integrated into the\n            wider developmental needs of the community such as access to\n            water, energy and food requirements. There is a need to make\n            a determination, during preparation and the early stages of\n            appraisal, about the level of Government commitment to the\n            project. If it is perceived to be lacking, there is a need\n            to engage in discussions with the government, at a higher\n            level, to determine where the problem lies. In some cases,\n            this may be due to a financial crisis in the government or\n            changing priorities in the government's agenda or\n            perhaps even a failure to engage the appropriate Ministers.\n            Once the exact problem is determined, there are many ways to\n            address it including scaling down the project, reshaping it\n            to address particular priorities, etc. However, early\n            diagnosis is important to ensure that this does not\n            adversely affect the project. Monitoring and evaluation\n            needs and capacities should be assessed in the first two or\n            three supervision missions to determine whether the team is\n            correctly setting up the M&E system. Where M&E\n            experience is lacking, the mission should make a concerted\n            effort to ensure that capacity building issues are addressed\n            by the implementing agency. For projects with a long time\n            line such as NRMP, the project should consider establishing\n            a separate M&E unit to increase effectiveness.\n            Legislative procedures and creation of by-laws is a slow\n            process that could confound the project if these are a\n            necessary first step for core implementation. A lesson\n            learnt is that in some case, legislation should be attained\n            prior to effectiveness to ensure that this process is\n            completed quickly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Natural Resource Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Natural Resource\n            Management

There are five\n            project components.  First, high forest resource management\n            will establish forest resource management policy and legal\n            framework; design and test integrated forest reserve\n            management systems and mechanism to encourage private sector\n            involvement in both on-  and off-reserve settings.  Second,\n            Savanna resource management will develop new\n            multidisciplinary institutional arrangements for drylands\n            management; and pilot test and implement improved systems\n            for community-based management of savanna woodland and other\n            resources.  Third, wildlife resource management will retrain\n            personnel in the Wildlife Department; and prepare and\n            implement park and reserve management plans.  Fourth,\n            environmental management coordination will support district\n            level environmental management planning and monitoring\n            capacity; and improve information flow among sectoral\n            agencies.

This\n            environmental impact assessment identifies the impacts the\n            project may have on biophysical and socio-economic\n            environment and describes mitigative measures to reduce such\n            impacts.  Wood processes could generate toxic chemicals\n            which will cause air pollution.  These processes will\n            require emission control.  Harvest activities may lead to\n            soil compaction and rainfall runoff, and thus reduce\n            groundwater recharge and increase flows of streams and\n            rivers.  During harvesting operation, best practice\n            guidelines will be followed to minimize the negative impacts\n            on hydrology and water quality, and prevent soil erosion.\n            Silvicultural techniques will regenerate new floral species\n            removed from the forest because of plantation establishment.\n            Plantations may also reduce biodiversity and cause a threat\n            to wildlife now present on degraded sites. Forest management\n            plans will be prepared to protect important wildlife\n            habitats and identify the important biodiversity areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Natural Resource
