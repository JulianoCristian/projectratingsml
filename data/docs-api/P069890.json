Lessons learned\n            from the project: Latvia Programmatic Structural Adjustment\n            Loan (PSAL) was comprehensive and broad based, but the\n            choice of instrument increased flexibility of its\n            application. When there is strong commitment by the society\n            and the Government, the implementation of reforms does not\n            need to be closely tied to the use of resources or to be\n            bound by legal obligations. Programmatic operations with\n            comprehensive institutional reforms require substantial\n            resources for quality supervision. Complementarity of the\n            PSAL with investment operations and coordination with\n            activities of the other donors are critical for capacity\n            building.

These objectives will be achieved by\n            implementing specific reforms in the areas of fiscal policy,\n            public sector management, human resources management, and\n            privatization and regulation of public utilities, and\n            private business, respectively. Nonetheless, the\n            deterioration of the current account deficit remains the\n            main macroeconomic risk to sustaining a high growth regime\n            in Latvia. Given the currency peg, a shortfall in political\n            commitment to fiscal balance, could undermine overall\n            sustainability. And, the frequent government changes, which\n            have characterized the country since independence, heightens\n            the risks to public sector reform, particularly given the\n            program's significant emphasis on improved governance.\n            To a substantial extent, risks are mitigated by project\n            design, and the content of the project as a single tranche\n            operation, linked to prior actions. Furthermore,\n            Latvia's strong determination to join the European\n            Union, also facilitates the continuity of the programmatic\n            approach, supported by the structural
