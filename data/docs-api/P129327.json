Project for\n            Kosovo were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was substantial,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: government\n            ownership and commitment is necessary for the success of\n            budget support operations. In countries with little or no\n            experience with budget support operations, the underlying\n            policy program should be selective and supervision and\n            technical assistance (TA) resources need to be dedicated to\n            support implementation of the reforms, especially in the\n            areas where capacity is low. In post-conflict countries,\n            where capacity is weak, development policy operations can be\n            effective instruments when accompanied by a critical mass of\n            technical assistance. Identifying good indicators to\n            evaluate progress in a short-term DPO can be difficult,\n            especially in countries with scarce data and limited\n            capacity. Coordinating a multi-donor trust fund is\n            time-consuming and costly but can sustain a consolidated and\n            impactful operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo - Second Sustainable
