In the context of\n            this project, Mauritania has managed to carry out the\n            modernization of its business law without any conflict with\n            the Islamic law thanks to the involvement of the traditional\n            magistrates in the process of law preparation. b)\n            Coordination is not a substitute for selectivity in project\n            design. While the preparation of the project took into\n            consideration lessons learned from previous operations and\n            put in place sound coordination mechanisms, the large number\n            of components and institutions involved in this project\n            entailed complexity and supervision difficulties. It would\n            have been helpful to limit the number of executing agencies\n            to facilitate project coordination and implementation. c)\n            Institutional change, particularly where capacities are\n            limited, require long-term actions. d) Business incentives\n            should not be reduced to a special tax regime. Experience\n            has demonstrated that the best climate for encouraging\n            private investment implies a stable low-tax, low-subsidy\n            environment which is also free of tax disincentives.\n            Investment codes should not focus on special tax regimes\n            which are difficult to administer, often lead to abuses, and\n            narrow the tax even further."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania -

The project will\n            finance the following three subcomponents: 1) upgrading of\n            credit risk and borrower arrears information; 2) training in\n            banking; and 3) study for the formulation of a strategy for\n            the second phase of financial sector development. With\n            respect to the private sector institutional and regulatory\n            framework, the project will finance the following: 1)\n            upgrading of the accounting and auditing framework; 2)\n            support to the Chamber of Commerce; 3) strengthening of\n            legal and judiciary framework; and 4) feasibility study of a\n            tax free regime for exporters. In the fishing and mining\n            sectors, the following components will be financed by the\n            project: 1) strengthening of the regulatory and\n            institutional framework of the mining sector; 2) survey of\n            fishing resources, establishment of a monitoring mechanism\n            for fish exports and strengthening of environmental and\n            quality
