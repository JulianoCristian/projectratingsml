Rapid\n            urbanization in Rwanda, had resulted in unplanned and\n            squalid settlements, urban sprawl, and increased urban\n            poverty. The Rwanda Urban Infrastructure and City Management\n            Project was designed to improve the provision of priority\n            infrastructure and services in the urban areas. The\n            construction of 22.6 kilometers of asphalt and stone paved\n            roads, reduced the transport costs for the urban population\n            by 60 percent. The construction of three primary schools,\n            health care center and youth center improved the social\n            infrastructure benefitting the people in urban areas. The\n            bus terminals built under the project, facilitated\n            inter-district movement within the city and improved\n            linkages with the neighboring areas resulting in improved\n            economic infrastructure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda -

Urban Infrastructure and City\n            Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Urban Infrastructure and\n            City Management Project for Rwanda were as follows: outcomes\n            were highly satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the city contract approach can be an\n            efficient tool to facilitate improvements in service\n            delivery and municipal and urban management, and to\n            accompany decentralization, even within a limited timeframe.\n            The project confirmed findings from other urban development\n            projects in the Africa region that this approach and its\n            tools (priority investment program, priority maintenance\n            program, municipal support program, and financial ratios)\n            can be used to effectively link infrastructure financing,\n            maintenance, and capacity building. The city contract\n            approach is flexible and could be adapted to the Rwandan\n            context. It proved highly effective in focusing activities\n            on results in a context marked by a combination of lack of\n            capacity and rapidly evolving decentralization. Bank\n            safeguard policies can be used as a basis for a constructive\n            dialogue on management of social and environmental impacts\n            of development efforts in general, bringing about changes\n            that reach beyond the project context. Land management is\n            highly sensitive in Rwanda and the needs for slum upgrading\n            are immense. Clearly demonstrating the benefits of a\n            market-based land valuation and participatory approach to\n            determining compensation led to changed approaches to slum\n            upgrading and resettlement, with a focus on the needs of the\n            affected populations. With the majority of the urban\n            population living in slums, recognition of their needs and\n            rights is an important element in sound urban land management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Urban Infrastructure and City\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Urban Infrastructure and\n            City
