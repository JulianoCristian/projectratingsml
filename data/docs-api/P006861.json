At the time the project was formulated\n            (1996-97), municipal finance in Colombia was expanding\n            rapidly, and longer terms with funding from local financial\n            markets seemed imminent. Although private participation was\n            mainly concentrated in 2 or 3 sectors in this project, its\n            role has proved important in accomplishing the main outcomes\n            of the project, and crucial in increasing loan volume in\n            response to the crisis. FINDETER has played an important\n            role in traditional sectors as water and sanitation,\n            education and transport. Although automatic rediscounting\n            has proved to be an excellent lending instrument, FINDETER\n            should improve this mechanism, partly by learning from other\n            second-floor banks' automatic rediscounting. The\n            project has demonstrated the need for flexibility, financial\n            innovation and continuous learning under the complex\n            framework of the economy. Close Bank involvement as part of\n            the FINDETER team clearly made important contributions to\n            the organization and the operation during the eventful\n            period of the project (1997 to mid 2004)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Urban Infrastructure Services\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Urban Infrastructure\n            Services Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5525664/colombia-urban-infrastructure-services-development-project","projn":"CO-Urban Infrastructure -- P006861","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Urban Economics,Banks & Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20041230132238"},"subsc":"General education sector,Telecommunications,Health,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General transportation sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Information and communications,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, administrative costs, assets,\n            autonomy, balance sheet, Bank Performance, cancellation,\n            capital markets, capitalization, commercial banks,\n            commercial borrowing, commercialization, counterpart,\n            counterpart funds, credit markets, credit risk, CURRENCY,\n            debt, Debt service, decentralization, devaluation,\n            disbursements, economic conditions, economic growth,\n            economic performance, excess liquidity, expenditures,\n            finance institutions, financial analysis, financial\n            indicators, financial institutions, financial\n            intermediaries, financial markets, financial products,\n            Financial rate of return, Financial Ratios, financial\n            sector, financial strength, financial structure, financial\n            system, FISCAL YEAR, foreign currency, foreign exchange,\n            Gross Domestic Product, hedging, housing, IFIs, inflation,\n            INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES, institutional capacity,\n            Institutional Development, Interest Rate, interest rate\n            risk, interest rates, key performance indicators, lease\n            financing, leasing, leasing companies, liquidity risk, local\n            government, local governments, long-term capital, margins,\n            market imperfections, Maturity, MDF, MDP, microfinance,\n            moral hazard, Municipal Development, Municipal finance,\n            municipal infrastructure, municipal investments,\n            municipalities, operating costs, Operating Income, Present\n            Value, principal risk, Private Sector, Project Costs, public\n            companies, public infrastructure, public service, Public\n            Services, rediscount, rediscount rates, regulatory\n            framework, return on equity, risk management, sanitation,\n            service providers, service provision, service \u00b7 delivery,\n            tax, tax law, technical assistance, Telecommunications, Time\n            Deposits, transport, transportation, Urban Development,\n            URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE, urban public services, urban public \u00b7\n            services, urban services, water supply, working capital"}},"owner":"Urban (LCSUW)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF022472-PHRD-URBAN REHAB. & MGMT.

The following impacts and mitigations are\n            described. Municipal waste management systems or sanitary\n            landfills will dispose of solid waste, mainly debris, and\n            domestic waste. Hazardous waste will be stored, reused, or\n            recycled. Sediments will be prevented from contaminating\n            water bodies. Liquid wastes will be diverted to septic\n            tanks, lagoons, infiltration fields, or municipal wastewater\n            systems.  Rainwater or running water will be stored or used\n            in irrigation or for animals. Covering transport vehicles,\n            using storage facilities, restricting vehicle operation,\n            prohibiting flammable and scrap materials (litter), and\n            periodically cleaning public sites bordering the works will\n            reduce air emissions. Establishing greenbelt zones,\n            reforestation, and replacing vegetal cover will reduce\n            erosion as will restoring removed topsoil, to be used to\n            spur vegetative growth. Important plants will be extracted\n            and stored for later replanting.
