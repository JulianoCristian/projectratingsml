With the\n            assistance of the International Development Association\n            (IDA) supervision mission in July 1979, early progress was\n            made in establishing the organizational and administrative\n            framework for project implementation. By the end of calendar\n            year 1979, preliminary administrative and operational\n            systems had been established. The principal weaknesses in\n            project design related to: (a) provision of technical\n            assistance (138 man-months) without a firm commitment from\n            Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) resulting in an ad hoc\n            reduction of consultancies to 50 man-months during\n            implementation; (b) inadequate operational funds for\n            Benchmark Survey and other monitoring and evaluation\n            activities; (c) optimistic assumptions on phasing of\n            procurement and buildings program; and (d) the expectation\n            that GOSL would have the financial resources for the\n            considerable investment on manpower and infrastructure. The\n            main lessons learned were: Adequate operational funds should\n            be provided under Monitoring and Evaluation to carry out\n            Benchmark Survey, monitoring studies, and special impact\n            studies;

The project would establish a link between\n            research and extension and enhance the intensity, coverage\n            and the content of agricultural extension services. A\n            unified extension system would be developed, under which\n            extension workers would receive biweekly training, visit\n            farmers according to planned schedules, and transmit\n            extension messages. The project would raise production and\n            income levels on about 4.8 m acres of land, cultivated by\n            about 1.4 m farm families. The output includes rice, a wide\n            range of upland crops, coconut and undercrops, vegetables\n            and fruits, and livestock."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Agricultural Extension
