Some lessons learned included:\n            the most effective way to improve services in island\n            economies is to develop ownership and accountability at the\n            community level. Procurement training and capacity building\n            for implementing agencies would need to pay more attention\n            to the contract management aspects of procurement. All\n            actors, including Ministries of Finance, need to be on board\n            to successfully manage contracts. Projects should not rely\n            extensively on human resources that are to be trained during\n            the project for purposes of project implementation. Where\n            staff of implementing agencies needs to be trained, on-the\n            job training with the help of consultant trainers may work\n            better than deputing a large number of staff frequently or\n            on long training programs during the project period.\n            Further, genuine decentralization or transfer of authority\n            with accountability is required to effectively address the\n            issue of ownership by subordinate implementing agencies. An\n            important corollary is that small or medium size civil works\n            located on remote islands should be managed and supervised\n            by island level leadership or management. Island communities\n            have successfully managed a wide variety of civil works, can\n            provide close supervision, direct small but important design\n            changes and ensure the accountability of the contractor. For\n            large works, a tandem arrangement, with<BR>initial\n            design and bidding responsibilities at the central level,\n            but supervision and payment authorization at the island\n            level, may work better than management through an external\n            contractor, who has no accountability at the island level.\n            The lack of authority at the local level also meant that the\n            islands looked to the center to fix even the smallest of\n            problems and repairs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Maldives - Integrated Human Development

There are\n            four project components along with project management and\n            evaluation. Component 1 strengthens education service\n            delivery. This project component will support: (a) enhancing\n            cost-effective access to secondary education, (b) improving\n            the quality of education on focus islands, and (c)\n            conducting whole school evaluations including assessments.\n            Component 2 strengthens health service delivery. The project\n            component supports (a) rationalizing care for\n            non-communicable diseases (NCDs), (b) enhancing support for\n            nutrition promotion to address the widespread problem of\n            childhood malnutrition through communication of strategic\n            behavioral changes, improved nutrition surveillance, and\n            greater use of locally relevant complementary foods.\n            Component 3 strengthens employment services. It will enhance\n            employment prospects of individuals, particularly those\n            residing in remote atolls by (a) supporting cost effective\n            job information and job counseling services through a\n            national jobs information network, job centers on focus\n            islands, career and employment counseling through job\n            centers and business centers to facilitate business\n            development; and (b) expanding existing mircrofinance\n            programs. Component 4 strengthens community services. The\n            project will improve service delivery by strengthening\n            community services.

Discharge points shall be established\n            through wastewater discharge permits  granted by the\n            relevant authorities. Each health care facility must\n            establish a Health Care Waste Management Plan, appropriate\n            to the scale and type of activities, and identified hazards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental report and environmental\n            management plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Maldives - Integrated Human\n            Development Project : environmental management :\n            Environmental report and environmental management plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/03/3144237/maldives-integrated-human-development-project-environmental-management-environmental-report-environmental-management-plan","projn":"MV-Maldives - Integrated Human Development\n            Project -- P078523","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Work & Working Conditions,Environmental Management,Labor Markets,Environmental Governance,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Social Protections and Labor","count":"Maldives","authors":{"authr":"Dr. Faathim Hameed"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040412154003"},"subsc":"General education sector,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Social Protections and Labor","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"environmental management,environmental\n            management plan,Environmental report"},"1":{"cdata!":"environmental management,environmental\n            management plan,Environmental report"}},"owner":"S.A.
