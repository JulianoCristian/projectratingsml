The overall performance of both the projects was rated\n            satisfactory; and the performance of the Bank was mixed. The\n            projects shared the objective of increasing the production,\n            incomes, and living standards of small farmer families, and\n            of developing state institutional capacity. A number of\n            lessons can be drawn from these projects. Many of these\n            lessons have been incorporated into the second generation\n            Northeast Rural Development Program which began in 1985 and\n            can be reflected in future rural development programs: (a)\n            In projects which are the first phase of a long-term\n            investment program, fundamental development constraints,\n            such as insecure land tenure or uncertain water\n            availability, should receive priority treatment in project\n            design and investment. (b) The degree of institutional\n            development, an essential factor in the implementation of a\n            successful rural development program, should be taken into\n            account when deciding upon specific project objectives and\n            estimating the project investment period and rate of return.\n            (c) In countries where the Bank is supporting a number of\n            similar projects, supervision should be reorganized so that\n            a part of the overall supervision time for the projects is\n            set aside to address common problems of a regional or\n            national scope in a coordinated fashion. (d) Loan\n            disbursement performance is not necessarily a good indicator\n            or proxy for project implementation performance or impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Rural Development Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Rural Development Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/05/724873/brazil-rural-development-projects","projn":"BR-Integ.
