The\n            project has either partially or fully achieved its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development has been\n            significant, sustainability is likely, and the performance\n            of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, plantation\n            sites should be clearly identified at appraisal in order to\n            ensure the availability of land for plantations. Second,\n            over-extended state institutions, such as the Forest\n            Department (FD), have performed poorly, in part due to the\n            lack of incentives to perform efficiently. A realistic set\n            of interventions should be envisaged as a result of\n            institutional capacity analysis. Third, the work of the\n            consultants and counterpart staff must be integrated in\n            project activities and evaluated systematically to ensure\n            the correct transfer of technology. Fourth, in retrospect,\n            it might have been advisable to delay appraisal of the\n            project until the outcome of the co-financing was known.\n            Fifth, the on-going work of the National Task Force,\n            including NGO representatives, is a hopeful indication of\n            the Government's recognition of the need for reform.\n            Finally, the Bank's concern for addressing important\n            basic policy issues must be continued by future donors as an\n            integral part of any future investment in the forestry sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -
