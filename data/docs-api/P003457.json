The Beilungang Thermal Power Project was designed to\n            support industrial growth in East China by increasing\n            electricity supply to the East China Grid, which was\n            suffering from acute power shortages. Bank performance from\n            project preparation through completion was satisfactory. The\n            Bank maintained good relations with the borrower, the\n            beneficiary and the consultants throughout project\n            execution. Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power Bureau (ZPEPB)\n            successfully completed the major project components-its\n            first 600 MW coal-fired unit and associated 500 kV\n            transmission line and substations-virtually within the\n            planned schedule. It overcame problems as they arose. The\n            project outcome is rated as satisfactory. Key lessons\n            learned includes: Procurement was somewhat protracted, and\n            construction and commissioning delays occurred due to\n            contractual interface problems and weak project management.\n            A serious boiler accident also occurred after commissioning.\n            In response to these problems, the Borrower has taken the\n            following precautions under the two subsequent operations:\n            (a) increased grouping of equipment supply contracts to\n            reduce interfaces between contractors and suppliers; (b)\n            timely staffing and training of the project implementation\n            organization; (c) use of model procurement documents\n            developed by the government with Bank assistance; and (d)\n            provision of increased consultant assistance to the\n            designers and project managers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Beilungang Thermal Power
