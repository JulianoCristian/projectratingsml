growth and poverty\n            reduction. The authorities have expressed their intention to\n            continue the implementation of the financial sector reform\n            program and more specifically their intention to strengthen\n            supervisory activities, keeping updated the database of\n            related parties, and further strengthening banking\n            resolution including through fully capitalizing the recently\n            created bank capitalization fund. This commitment is\n            particularly important because of the new challenges that\n            the food crisis is creating for the financial sector, as\n            higher food prices negatively affect the portfolio of\n            consumer loans and the country's macroeconomic\n            stability. In particular, strong supervisory activities and\n            a well capitalized bank capitalization fund are crucial\n            stabilizing factors for the financial system, because they\n            signal to the market that the authorities will be able to\n            respond to banks in difficulties and avoid a systemic\n            crisis. Maintaining an appropriate macroeconomic framework\n            is an integral part of the Government's strategy to\n            keep a strong financial sector. The country's\n            macroeconomic program is being supported by a Stand-by\n            arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n            Unfortunately, the government is facing unanticipated fiscal\n            pressures arising from additional spending needs resulting\n            from the food crisis and lower than anticipated external financing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - First Programmatic Financial\n            Sector Development Policy Credit Project : supplemental financing"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Honduras -

Financial Sector\n            Development Policy Credit Project is the first operation of\n            its kind, to be implemented in two phases. The first phase\n            will support financial sector institutional development,\n            through reforms in the following five areas: a) strategy for\n            the management of systemic risks, b) legal and regulatory\n            framework, c) anti-money laundering, and prevention of\n            terrorism financing, d) strengthening of supervision, and\n            control of systemic risks, and, e) payments system. A second\n            phase that would partially fund a systemic consolidation\n            strategy, would be triggered by key indicative actions such\n            as: a) private consensus on a consolidation strategy, b)\n            demonstrated practical relevance of the institutional\n            development supported by the first phase; and, c) a\n            diagnosis of the solvency position of the largest banks. The\n            project will support sorely needed institutional development\n            in key areas affecting the financial sector, and will also\n            strengthen the dialogue between the Bank and Honduras,\n            placing the Bank in a better position to assist in the\n            financial sector's consolidation process. While there\n            is little risk that actions required under the first project\n            might not be taken, there is however, the need for\n            substantial additional reform, built
