IFCT will\n            be authorized to make individual subloans of up to $750,000\n            without the Bank's prior approval, up to an aggregate\n            amount of $10.0 million. It is expected that about half of\n            the number of subprojects and three quarters of the amount\n            committed will require prior approval by the Bank.\n            Expenditures made prior to 90 days of the date of receipt by\n            the Bank of each subloan application will not be eligible\n            for financing. The proposed Bank Loan will be repaid in\n            conformity with a schedule based on the aggregate of the\n            amortization schedules of IFCT subloans, which will have a\n            maximum repayment period of fifteen years, including up to\n            three years of grace."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Third Industrial Finance\n            Corporation of Thailand Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Third Industrial\n            Finance Corporation of Thailand Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1976/08/734726/thailand-third-industrial-finance-corporation-thailand-project","projn":"TH-Dfc III (Ifct) -- P004691","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism,Financial Intermediation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101911173953"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abatement,accounting,ADB,Agricultural\n            Credit,Agriculture,auditors,balance of payments,Bank of\n            Japan,Bank of Thailand,banking sector,banking system,book\n            value,capacity utilization,capital base,capital\n            flows,capital formation,capital goods,commercial bank\n            deposits,commercial banks,commodity\n            prices,competitiveness,current\n            prices,debt,deposits,Development Strategy,economic\n            activity,Employment,Equity\n            Investments,expenditures,exports,financial\n            institutions,financial performance,Financial Sector,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fixed capital,foreign banks,foreign capital,foreign\n            currency,Foreign Exchange,foreign investment,foreign\n            ownership,foreign shareholders,GDP,Government\n            securities,Gross Domestic Product,gross fixed capital\n            formation,growth rate,housing,imports,income\n            distribution,Industrialization,Inflation,inflation\n            rate,insurance,interest income,interest rate,Interest\n            Rates,international reserves,labor\n            force,laws,Legislation,lending\n            institutions,liquidity,maturities,merchant banking,Mutual\n            Fund,net worth,PORTFOLIO,price\n            controls,productivity,profitability,reorganization,Resource\n            Allocation,Resource Mobilization,rural\n            communities,Savings,Securities,side effects,technical\n            assistance,terms of trade,transport,underwriters,unemployment"},"1":{"cdata!":"abatement,accounting,ADB,Agricultural\n            Credit,Agriculture,auditors,balance of payments,Bank of\n            Japan,Bank of Thailand,banking sector,banking system,book\n            value,capacity utilization,capital base,capital\n            flows,capital formation,capital goods,commercial bank\n            deposits,commercial banks,commodity\n            prices,competitiveness,current\n            prices,debt,deposits,Development Strategy,economic\n            activity,Employment,Equity\n            Investments,expenditures,exports,financial\n            institutions,financial performance,Financial Sector,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fixed capital,foreign banks,foreign capital,foreign\n            currency,Foreign Exchange,foreign investment,foreign\n            ownership,foreign shareholders,GDP,Government\n            securities,Gross Domestic Product,gross fixed capital\n            formation,growth rate,housing,imports,income\n            distribution,Industrialization,Inflation,inflation\n            rate,insurance,interest income,interest rate,Interest\n            Rates,international reserves,labor\n            force,laws,Legislation,lending\n            institutions,liquidity,maturities,merchant banking,Mutual\n            Fund,net worth,PORTFOLIO,price\n            controls,productivity,profitability,reorganization,Resource\n            Allocation,Resource Mobilization,rural\n            communities,Savings,Securities,side effects,technical\n            assistance,terms of trade,transport,underwriters,unemployment"}},"owner":"Southeast Asia Headquarters Unit (EACSQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"1157"},"facets":{}}}
