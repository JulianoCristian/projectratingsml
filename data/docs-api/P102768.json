Some lessons learned includes: a\n            longer project timeframe could have been considered given\n            the complexity and effort needed for reforming the\n            cooperative sector in India. Governance reforms should be\n            supplemented from the start with a very strong focus on\n            enhancing credit risk management and recovery of\n            non-performing loans. For ongoing monitoring and fine-tuning\n            of the program, a stronger effort to collect, monitor and\n            evaluate Primary Agricultural Credit Society (PACS) data at\n            the central level is necessary. To improve governance and\n            capacity, efforts have to be brought to the field and the\n            cascading training approach provides a replicable model.\n            Early involvement of the Bank in program design is\n            important. Since members' (mostly farmers')\n            demands are diverse, a project should consider different\n            types of financial/non-financial services. Financial\n            services involve not only credit, but also different\n            products, such as savings and insurance. Close dialogue and\n            strong coordination between the central and state\n            governments are necessary. Members' education needs\n            adequate attention to communicate program benefits to the\n            ultimate beneficiary group. It is important that members\n            understand the reform program and what the reform means to\n            them. For a front-loaded governance reform program, a clear\n            reporting framework on reform benchmark activities is\n            critical. Country-based staff plays a key role in close\n            monitoring, guidance and support during the project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Strengthening India's Rural\n
