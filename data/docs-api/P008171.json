Borrower\n            performance for the Vocational Training Project was\n            satisfactory, while the two Education Quality Improvement\n            Projects had highly satisfactory Borrower performances. This\n            assessment confirms a number of education sector lessons:\n            1) Preschool attendance helps reduce grade repetition and\n            improves long-term academic achievement for low-income\n            students. 2) A longer school day may improve test scores for\n            disadvantaged students. To maximize performance in higher\n            grades, students in lower grades might spend part of the\n            extra time practicing the prerequisite basic skills. 3)\n            Educational quality depends on a strong and functional\n            supervisory chain that supervises teachers closely to see\n            that government policies and learning activities are carried\n            out effectively. 4) Enhance project efficiency through\n            instructional methods that enable most of the students to\n            achieve educational objectives within the prescribed\n            instructional time. Further research and experimentation\n            will help determine which instructional activities are more\n            cost-effective in the Uruguayan context. 5)\n            Vocational-technical education project appraisals may\n            overestimate the number of likely graduates and not\n            adequately take into account dropout rates or changing\n            demand for training. In future project appraisals take into\n            account country experience on dropout rates as well as\n            demand changes during times of economic hardship."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay -

Overall, World Bank\n            performance is satisfactory: Well-defined and well-targeted\n            activities focus on project objectives, and appropriate\n            support toward their completion fostered a positive\n            relationship between Bank and Borrower and ultimately led to\n            successful project completion. Overall Borrower performance\n            is rated as highly likely for its quality inputs during\n            project preparation and highly competent project\n            implementation. Lessons learned include the following:\n            Establishing parallel institutions may undermine\n            stakeholders' support for the project. Stakeholder\n            consultation and participation at the early stages of\n            project preparation promotes ownership and, consequently,\n            sustainability. Education Improvement Projects (PMEs) have a\n            substantial impact that go betond the classroom.
