Bank\n            performance is rated satisfactory. Borrower performance\n            overall is considered satisfactory in the implementation of\n            the program, especially with respect to perseverance in\n            carrying out the program once economic conditions\n            deteriorated and in the face of domestic opposition. A\n            stable social and political environment is essential to\n            support macroeconomic and structural reforms. The government\n            made good progress during the early phase of the project,\n            but increasingly, in the face of domestic opposition,\n            political instability, civil unrest and a mutiny, program\n            implementation became more arduous during 2001. Other\n            lessons learned include these: Careful investment in\n            preparation to ensure strong ownership and build counterpart\n            commitment and understanding are important to maintain\n            reform momentum. It was worth taking the risk of involvement\n            in a new adjustment program once the new government had\n            established its reformist credentials, notwithstanding the\n            poor track record of reforms of previous governments. When\n            counterpart capacity is not strong, close and frequent\n            supervision by the Bank is neded to achieve program\n            completion. The burden of program implementation would have\n            been considerably eased and made smoother if a more formal\n            and extensive mechanism had been established in government\n            with responsibility for program implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea - Governance Promotion\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Papua New

New Guinea.  The Requesters claim that\n            the Papua New Guinea government and logging industry\n            participants failed to fulfill or demonstrate good faith on\n            conditionalitys aimed at improving forest governance,\n            imposed by the Bank on the Structural Adjustment Programme\n            Loan (SAL.) The Requesters claim that the submission deals\n            with significant instances of social, cultural, ecological\n            and economic harm and that the disbursement of the second\n            tranche without requiring a full review of the contractual\n            provisions of the loan constitutes a violation of the\n            contractual provisions of the SAL by loaning to a borrower\n            defaults to implement its own promises.  Examples set out in\n            the claim indicating the development objectives of the\n            governance loan have not been met and are unlikely to be\n            met, if the disbursement of the second tranche is completed.\n            The Requesters ask the Inspection Panel to address the need\n            that arises from this claim. The Requesters ask that there\n            be a moratorium on new concessions in the forests of Papua\n            New Guinea to allow a respite for reform, that landowners be\n            compensated for their losses, and the institutional reform\n            processes put in place firmly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea -

Hence the loan\n            includes components to improve fiscal and debt management,\n            governance and civil service effectiveness, delivery of\n            health and education services, forestry management, the\n            quality and efficiency of financial services including those\n            available through privatization, and the operating\n            environment for business. A pervading theme is to strengthen\n            governance in public institutions through enhanced\n            transparency and accountability. Other benefits expected\n            include improved public sector management capacity to\n            provide core government services, a reduced public sector\n            role in commercial activities, an improved climate for\n            private sector development, and improved management of\n            natural resources. The risks to attaining the loan's\n            objectives stem for a number of factors: political\n            opposition could compromise reform; weaknesses in\n            implementation capacity could constrain reform\n            sustainability; the government's vulnerability to\n            commodity price fluctuations and natural disasters could\n            undermine gains from improved policy; and high crime rates\n            could weaken the supply response from ongoing reforms. In\n            accordance with noted conditions, the loan will be disbursed\n            in two tranches."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea - Governance Promotion\n            Adjustment Loan
