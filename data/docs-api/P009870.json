Lessons learned emphasize the clarity\n            of, and realistic operational, and institutional project\n            objectives, as the main reasons for the overall project\n            success, which helped the proactive participation, and\n            commercial success of the Container Corporation of India\n            (CONCOR), and allowed as well for the timely availability of\n            counterpart funding. However, managing procurement issues\n            revealed several weaknesses, i.e., qualifying criteria were\n            not stringent enough to exclude financially, weak bidders;\n            the pre-qualification criteria could have been strengthened\n            by including stricter financial parameters for large\n            contracts; and, there was no real devolution of procurement\n            powers to the implementing agency. Instead, by excluding\n            likely insolvent suppliers, procurement delays would have\n            been minimized; indeed, lessons for the future point to the\n            need of effective early preparation. As for the partial\n            privatization of CONCOR, regardless of its initial\n            commercial mindset, its full commercialization cannot be\n            completed without a decrease in the Government of\n            India's shareholding to less than fifty percent\n            (private sector ownership is only thirty seven percent). It\n            is important to note that recognizing the Bank's\n            contribution in facilitating the introduction, and adoption\n            of modern technology (container flatcar technology) proved\n            successful, resulting in operational changes in respect to\n            train operating speed, transit time, and service reliability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
