The\n            risk to development outcome was low or negligible, and the\n            performance by both Bank and the borrower was satisfactory.\n            The following were few of the lessons learned: (1) single\n            initiative or program can serve as a practical and concrete\n            base for the installation of broader social protection\n            system which can be extended to cover other populations. (2)\n            Bank financing can play a role in financing activities which\n            once validated can be incorporated into the national budget;\n            (3) integrated information system is critical in order to\n            ensure that social programs reach those who need them the\n            most, and to guard the system from falling prey to abuse.\n            Without such a system social policies and interventions\n            cannot be effectively targeted, monitored or evaluated; (4)\n            the incorporation of the targeting instrument into the\n            integrated social information platform was a powerful tool\n            in the creation of a national registry of beneficiaries\n            which in turn became a valuable tool for managing a network\n            of social protection services; (5) high-quality\n            administrative data bases can be an important source of\n            information not only for the monitoring of social programs,\n            but also their impact evaluation, particularly if they can\n            be linked to survey data."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Social Protection Technical\n            Assistance

The poor and vulnerable were exposed to a\n            wide range of risks and shocks that affected their current\n            wellbeing and their longer-term prospects for rising out of\n            poverty. To address these challenges, all countries need\n            social safety nets both to protect the vulnerable from\n            falling into poverty during crises and to help them\n            transition out of poverty in the absence of larger crises.\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n            has helped countries in Latin America and the Caribbean\n            pioneer conditional cash transfers (CCTs) as a proven\n            approach to helping people out of poverty. CCT programs have\n            implemented novel approaches to targeting the poor,\n            addressing gender issues, transferring funds, fostering\n            social accountability, building error and fraud control\n            systems, and strengthening governance. CCT programs have\n            also used new technologies such as bank cards to facilitate\n            payments and cell phones to send educational messages to\n            recipients. They have linked clients to social services,\n            helped obtain identity documents for marginalized groups,\n            and promoted savings as a medium-term strategy to help CCT\n            households out of poverty. CCTs supported by the IBRD in the\n            last decade benefitted about 21 million households annually\n            in Latin America and the Caribbean."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Transferencias monetarias condicionadas\n            mejoran capital humano"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Social protection in Latin\n            America and the Caribbean : Transferencias monetarias\n            condicionadas mejoran capital humano"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/03/25162223/social-protection-latin-america-caribbean-transferencias-monetarias-condicionadas-mejoran-capital-humano","count":"Mexico,Chile,Colombia,Jamaica","lang":"Spanish","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Health and other social services,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"safety nets, society, people, community, protection"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social dev/gender/inclusion,Public sector governance,Social protection and risk management,Human development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Transferencias monetarias condicionadas\n            mejoran capital humano"}},"topic":"Social Protection and Labor m1327194 697,Social Insurance m1326950 751,Social Assistance m1327201 1466,Labor Markets m1326488 855,Social Protection and Labor Systems\n            m1326703 1677","projn":"JM-Social Protection Project-929135 -- P105024,CO-Support For The Second Phase Of The\n            Expansion Of The Program Of -- P101211,CL-Social Protection Technical Assistance -- P082037,MX-Support To Oportunidades Project -- P115067","subtopic":"Safety Nets and Transfers,Social Funds and Pensions,Employment and Unemployment,Work & Working Conditions,Social Protections & Assistance","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Social Protections and Labor","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08314d438_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!North America"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!North America"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!North America"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!North America"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","theme":"Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance &\n            Social Care Services,Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems,Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship,Improving labor markets,Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance &\n            Social Care Services,Nutrition and food security,Education for all,Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship,Indigenous peoples,Other social development,Administrative and civil service reform,Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring,Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance &\n            Social Care Services","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Social Protections and Labor","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Social Protection and Labor m1327194 697,Social Insurance m1326950 751,Social Assistance m1327201 1466,Labor Markets m1326488 855,Social Protection and Labor Systems\n            m1326703 1677","owner":"Social Protect &  Labor - GP (GSPDR),Social Protection & Labor LCR (GSP04)","trustfund":"TF096356-Contigo Vamos Evaluation,TF098119-Mexico: Scaling Up Nutrition","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"},"3":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"95534"},"facets":{}}}
