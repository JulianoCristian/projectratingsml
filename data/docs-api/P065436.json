Some lessons learned included: The\n            road agency model has provided sufficient institutional\n            capacity in low income countries such as Tanzania and Uganda\n            to improve the delivery of new main roads and their\n            maintenance. Supporting road funds can further enhance road\n            sub-sector reform provided they are properly designed and\n            adequately resourced. During road reform initiatives, the\n            borrower's absorptive capacity, the degree of\n            opposition to change and the time it takes to prepare and\n            adopt new legislation, have often been miscalculated by the\n            Bank and other development partners. The Bank thus needs to\n            ensure appropriate training and skills deployment to i)\n            assess and address the borrower's institutional and\n            absorptive capacity limitations; ii) gauge the degree of\n            resistance to change and make a plan to deal with it, and\n            iii) realistically estimate the time it takes to prepare,\n            adopt and apply new legislation. An annual assessment of the\n            condition and traffic usage of the roads in the network\n            enables the decision makers and the public to understand the\n            implications of

- Second Phase of the Road\n            Development Program Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Second Phase of the Road\n            Development Program Project in Uganda were as follows:\n            overall outcome of the project was rated as satisfactory;\n            risk to development outcome was moderated; and the\n            performance of the Bank and the Borrower was rated\n            moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned include: 1) Uganda\n            National Roads Authority (UNRA) took long to implement. It\n            would have been advisable to set intermediate triggers in\n            the APL to help accelerate the creation of UNRA. The policy\n            and institutional reforms to transform the ministry's\n            road agency (RAFU) to an autonomous road authority (UNRA)\n            have taken much more time than the anticipated three and\n            half years at project appraisal. While the time needed for\n            the societal decision making process to create UNRA clearly\n            has been underestimated, it also seems that, having created\n            Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU), was a disincentive to\n            rapidly move towards the more comprehensive and autonomous\n            UNRA; 2) future technical assistance (TAs) should have clear\n            objectives of building local capacity with measurable\n            outputs in a specified time. When RAFU was created in 1998,\n            its head and other key staff were expatriate staff appointed\n            under the project funded TA program. The involvement of the\n            TAs was slowly phased out as the capability of national\n            professionals was developed to manage the activities of the\n            sector. In 2004 a Ugandan national professional with a good\n            performance record was appointed as the Director of RAFU,\n            thus replacing an expatriate staff and this has proven to be\n            effective. However, the skill transfer to local staff was\n            not very effective and took a long time; and 3) the\n            application of lime stabilized sub-base needs to be\n            carefully reviewed. For the first phase of the APL\n            instrument, independent consultant was engaged to review the\n            performance of mechanical modification of the sub-base on\n            contract C005 as proposed by the contractor and accepted by\n            the engineer. This was a fairly new area for the\n            implementing agency and, as such, they needed some\n            re-assurance. Based on the consultant's findings and\n            recommendations, this technology was successfully adopted\n            for construction of the sub-base on contract C007 where the\n            designed lime stabilization could not work as the lime\n            meeting the specifications could not react properly with\n            natural gravel available in the project area."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Second Phase of the Road\n            Development Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Second Phase of the Road\n            Development

This will necessarily involve\n            land acquisition, therefore this resettlement action plan\n            (RAP) aims to ensure that displaced people benefit from the\n            project, minimizing social disruption, so as to improve\n            their livelihoods, and, restore their income. The RAP is\n            based on the country's 1995 Constitution, and legal\n            framework, the Land, and Land Acquisition Acts (1998 and\n            1965), and, on the Bank's operational guidelines\n            regarding resettlement. Compensation standards for assets\n            lost will be at replacement costs, its valuation applicable\n            to land tenure types. Grievance mechanisms will be available\n            for disputes over land acquisition, and resettlement issues.\n            Access to training, employment, and credit opportunities\n            will be made available to displaced people, through\n            vocational training for either new employment, or incentives\n            via credit for small business expansion as appropriate.\n            Construction allowances, will be provided, as will\n            infrastructure services (e.g., water supply), and social\n            services (e.g., schools, health facilities). Implementation\n            of the resettlement process will be monitored and evaluated\n            during project preparation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Road Development Program (Phase 2)\n

Phase I of the Action Plan to be implemented under the\n            Phase II project will involve civil works to improve\n            accident blackspots on major corridors, and consulting\n            services concerning the design and construction supervision\n            of such works. 3) The third component will support the\n            preparation of a national transport master plan and\n            transport master plan for Greater Kampala. 4) The fourth\n            component will finance pilot project for demonstration use\n            of innovative technologies for construction of low
