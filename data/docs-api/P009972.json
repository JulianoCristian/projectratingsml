Some lessons learned included: the\n            lack of attention to human resource development in a period\n            of rapid change in the highway sector can constrain project\n            development implementation. The current shortage of\n            qualified manpower is out of phase with the enormous demand\n            of large infrastructure projects. The Government and\n            industry need to create incentives and facilities for\n            systematic training to increase the number of qualified road\n            engineers, and technicians. There is also a need for\n            competent environmental officers, an important career track\n            not yet widely recognized in the road sector. The assignment\n            of responsibility for sector studies and technical\n            assistance to the implementing agency instead of the sector\n            ministry can reduce the attention to a highway projects\n            broader institutional and sector development aspects.\n            National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was primarily\n            concerned with implementing the Ministry's policy by\n            building roads. It is not clear that the organization had\n            the capability to concentrate on monitoring and evaluating\n            the various institutional studies. Also, policy and planning\n            in the roads sector are the responsibility of the ministry\n            and the studies under the project were more in line with\n            this mandate than

It assesses potential impacts on climate,\n            topography, and natural drainage systems, indicating no\n            significant changes are expected in these areas. Conversely,\n            the loss of productive soil, natural habitats, and\n            bio-diversity, are major direct, and adverse long-term\n            impacts, but it is proposed that acquisition of fertile land\n            be minimal. Similarly, careful project design would avoid\n            adversity to cultural, and archaeological sites.\n            Nonetheless, during construction, it is expected that\n            temporary adverse impacts will occur on human health, due to\n            rising pollution levels, and vector borne diseases. An\n            analysis of alternatives is provided, and, mitigating\n            measures include slope stabilization through borrow pits, to\n            prevent soil erosion, and sedimentation. Measures will be\n            taken to minimize soil contamination due to oil spillage,\n            and selected waste disposal sites will be available.\n            Suitable design will minimize impacts on surface waters,\n            and, other mitigating measures include noise abatement, air\n            quality control, afforestation, as well as drainage, and\n            sanitation infrastructure improvements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tree plantation strategy"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India -
