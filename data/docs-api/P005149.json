First, it is reinforced that\n            disbursement, and physical achievements are not always good\n            indicators of project success, aggravated if failure to\n            address systemic institutional problems, adversely affect\n            operational efficiency and sustainability of project works,\n            making lending ineffective. This not only hampers the\n            Bank's reform agenda, but causes also concern among the\n            Bank's development partners, who see the Bank as the\n            interlocutor capable of advancing institutional, and policy\n            reforms with the Government of Egypt. Second, it should be\n            taken into consideration the fact that in-country Bank\n            partnership with bilateral development agencies, is a\n            powerful instrument for institutional reform, who develop\n            long-term institution-building relationships with government\n            in specific sectors, potentially, and significantly\n            increasing the utility, relevance, and leverage of Bank\n            assistance. In Egypt, bilateral agencies bring differing\n            perspectives to the water, and agriculture sub-sector, and\n            are notably strong at capacity building in drainage, and\n            community development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Second Pumping Stations\n            Rehabilitation and National Drainage Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Second Pumping Stations\n            Rehabilitation and National Drainage Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/02/3038115/egypt-second-pumping-stations-rehabilitation-national-drainage-projects","projn":"EG-Irrig./Pumping -- P005149,EG-National Drainage -- P005146","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Water Supply and Systems,Rural Portfolio Improvement,Water and Industry,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040316100252"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            production,agricultural\n            projects,Agriculture,beneficiaries,bilateral donors,broad\n            range,canals,community\n            development,construction,corrosion,covering,crops,development\n            objectives,Drainage,Engineering,equipment,farmers,farms,feed,flexibility,Groundwater,Innovation,Institutional\n            Development,integration,Irrigation,laboratories,livestock,marketing,natural\n            resources,nongovernmental\n            organizations,Operations,pipe,pm,pollution,private\n            sector,Pumping,Pumping Equipment,pumping plant,Pumping\n            Stations,pumps,PVC,quality at\n            entry,stakeholders,supervision,sustainability,sustainable\n            use,waste,waste waters,water quality,Water Resources"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            production,agricultural\n            projects,Agriculture,beneficiaries,bilateral donors,broad\n            range,canals,community\n            development,construction,corrosion,covering,crops,development\n            objectives,Drainage,Engineering,equipment,farmers,farms,feed,flexibility,Groundwater,Innovation,Institutional\n            Development,integration,Irrigation,laboratories,livestock,marketing,natural\n            resources,nongovernmental\n            organizations,Operations,pipe,pm,pollution,private\n            sector,Pumping,Pumping Equipment,pumping plant,Pumping\n            Stations,pumps,PVC,quality at\n            entry,stakeholders,supervision,sustainability,sustainable\n            use,waste,waste waters,water quality,Water Resources"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND","repnb":"28003"},"728066":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1999/02/728066/egypt-second-pumping-stations-rehabilitation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1999/02/728066/egypt-second-pumping-stations-rehabilitation-project","new_url":"1999/02/728066/egypt-second-pumping-stations-rehabilitation-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/03/03/000094946_99031910565245/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/03/03/000094946_99031910565245/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"3198","datestored":"2000-03-03T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1999-02-08T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Second Pumping Stations\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall outcome of the project is\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned are: a) A flexible\n            program approach has been keen to guaranteeing project\n            success, as it allowed the Bank and the implementing agency\n            to respond adequately to changes in rehabilitation\n            priorities during project implementation. b) The appraisal\n            team did not take into account the slow system in Egypt of\n            awarding contracts for procurement of goods and the slow\n            pace of civil work construction for pumping stations. c)\n            Monitoring and evaluation capacity needs to be enhanced at\n            Mechanical and Electrical Department (MED) to enable the\n            tracking of project costs, benefits, and impacts. d)\n            Although not part of the project, it was realized that an\n            environment unit is needed at MED to monitor water and other\n            related environment quality and alert authorities about\n            problems for corrective action. e) In the case of new\n            stations, close coordination by MED of the\n            electro-mechanical equipment contracts and related civil\n            work contracts is key to reducing implementation delays. f)\n            There are considerable benefits to having repeater projects\n            with the same implementation agency. This allows the\n            building of a core professional team at MED that is familiar\n            with World Bank requirements for project implementation, and\n            that can save effort and time because it is well established\n            and operational."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt -
