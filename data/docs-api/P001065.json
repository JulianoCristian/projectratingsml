Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, a broad country-wide approach to improving\n            rural infrastructure has a high impact on the supply\n            response of agriculture production and service delivery.\n            Second, assigning responsibility for project implementation\n            to agencies within the existing institutional framework can\n            work well. Third, labor-based feeder road development is a\n            most suitable entry point for the development of a private\n            construction industry. Fourth, sustainability in privatizing\n            rural works construction and maintenance cannot be assured\n            without a multi-year work program and facilities for renting\n            equipment. Fifth, works carried out by labor-based methods\n            versus conventional equipment-based methods have advantages\n            such as easier maintenance. Finally, in the\n            resource-constrained environment of a country undergoing\n            structural adjustment, establishment of a Road Fund is\n            necessary to ensure the steady and timely availability of\n            resources for maintaining the road infrastructure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - National Rural Infrastructure
