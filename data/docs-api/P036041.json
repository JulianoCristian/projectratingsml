The performances of the world Bank and the\n            Borrower were rated satisfactory. The Fiscal TA Project\n            offers several lessons: 1) Strong commitment of the\n            Government is instrumental in institutional reforms: Under\n            each of the project components, the process and results of\n            implementation indicate that without a clear signal from the\n            top of the Government, institutional reforms are difficult\n            to implement. Government priorities also affect the\n            incentives and ability of Government officials to\n            participate in capacity building activities. 2) The World\n            Bank's contribution is vital in facilitating the\n            transfer of expertise: Several implementing agencies,\n            including the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) and the\n            Budget and Treasury Departments of the Ministry of Finance\n            (MOF), indicated that, although their original emphasis\n            under the project was on obtaining equipment, they have\n            learned that the World Bank's contribution was most\n            vital in facilitating and adapting appropriate international\n            expertise, in promoting broad-based human capacity building,\n            and in establishing knowledge-sharing and networking\n            arrangements that would last well beyond the life of the\n            project. 3) The evolution of Government priorities affects\n            system design. It became apparent particularly in the tax\n            administration component, that the most urgent priorities of\n            the Government may marginalize other considerations\n            important to design systems for a longer-term use. While the\n            China Tax Administration Information System (CTAIS) system\n            clearly made an enormous contribution to improving the\n            Government revenue performance, it was built around the\n            1995/96 Government's urgent objective of improving\n            control and compliance in tax collection. Other objectives\n            relevant for system design, such as efficiency, convenience\n            and user-friendliness were not adequately reflected in the\n            original design. Marginalization of these softer objectives\n            in the original design, along with the continuing emergence\n            of new technical tools (such as wider use of the internet\n            and telecommunication network) since the original design was\n            completed, may necessitate future changes in the system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Fiscal Technical Assistance
