Following are some\n            lessons learned from the project experience. Taking into\n            account the project's expected, and improved delivery\n            of services, as well as the inherent reforms it entails,\n            such reforms must be accompanied by adequate Government\n            resources to support them, that is funding for the agreed\n            requirements under the legislation (Water and Sanitation\n            Act, 1997), redundancy payments, and working capital, while\n            the consequences of a reform agenda on the Government budget\n            must be clearly identified. Regarding civil works, the\n            choice of expenditure was for items with heavy foreign\n            exchange content, with the expectation that the public\n            sector would undertake less capital intensive works, such as\n            repair and expansion to the distribution system. This\n            technology choice is reflected in the negative Net Present\n            Value (NPV), where heavy capital costs for rehabilitation,\n            are not set against increased numbers of consumers, showing\n            instead consistent low returns, since by and large, benefits\n            in water supply systems come from expanding the\n            distribution, and selling more water. But, the public sector\n            did not choose to invest in the expansion of the\n            distribution system, actually, the number of consumers did\n            not increase dramatically. With respect to water borne\n            disease and cholera, the lack of focus on sanitation may\n            have lowered the effectiveness regarding disease control,\n            but a health component that would include hygiene education,\n            and thus achieved these objectives, may not be best placed\n            in a water rehabilitation project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia -

Both activities focus on a\n            participatory demand-based approach, and as such, seek to\n            break the persistent cycle of non-payment and inadequate\n            service provision. Second, technical assistance and studies\n            will be provided to support immediate improvements in\n            participating council's management capacity and propose\n            alternative methods of organizing services and evaluating\n            trade-offs. Third, capacity building assistance will look to\n            the medium term and outline how future urban policy can\n            avoid mistakes of past policies. Project components comprise\n            the following: 1) water supply and sanitation system\n            rehabilitation; 2) community-based water and sanitation\n            demonstration projects;

immediate solutions to the most severe water and sewerage\n            infrastructure deficiencies in nine key urban areas; 2) test\n            out community-generated and managed water and sanitation\n            demonstration projects which meet articulated needs at an\n            affordable price while strengthening local councils\n            capacities to support community based initiatives in Lusaka\n            and the participating Copperbelt councils; and 3) initiate\n            broader institutional and financial reforms required for\n            providing organizational incentives for investing in,\n            operating and maintaining infrastructure based on\n            residents' perceived needs and willingness to pay.\n            Based on priority attached to the water sector expressed in\n            various fora by central and local government and by\n            residents themselves, the project proposes to use water\n            supply as an entry point for developing furture investment\n            programs, initially concentrating on rehabilitation, in\n            formal settlement areas and testing institutional options in\n            peri-urban, unserviced areas. Both activities focus on a\n            participatory demand-based approach, and as such, seek to\n            break the persistent cycle of non-payment and inadequate\n            service provision. Second, technical assistance and studies\n            will be provided to support immediate improvements in\n            participating council's management capacity and propose\n            alternative methods of organizing services and evaluating\n            trade-offs. Third, capacity building assistance will look to\n            the medium term and outline how future urban policy can\n            avoid mistakes of past policies. Project components comprise\n            the following: 1) water supply and sanitation system\n            rehabilitation; 2) community-based water and sanitation\n            demonstration projects; and 3) sectoral and local government\n            reform and capacity building."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Urban Restructuring and Water\n            Supply
