The lessons the project provided related to\n            the effectiveness of a separate component for land\n            acquisition and economic rehabilitation in economically\n            rehabilitating project affected persons; the contribution of\n            an extended policy dialogue and detailed preparation to\n            project implementation; the need to continue a\n            multi-disciplinary approach to agricultural development\n            including flexible investment in agricultural services,\n            government extension services, and marketing networks. A\n            focus should be put on more efficient procurement\n            organization and procedures, as well as training in them;\n            reconsidering the efficacy of imposing less

experienced\n            nongovernmental organizations capable of training less\n            experienced NGOs; recognizing the role of water user\n            associations as change agents, especially those involving\n            women farmers; the need to contract reputed firms/make\n            quality-based selection of firms for software development;\n            the importance of drafting more

The project\n            includes three major components: 1) modernization and\n            rehabilitation of existing irrigation sub-projects; 2)\n            completion of on-going irrigation works on a number of minor\n            irrigation schemes; and 3) institutional strengthening,\n            training, and special studies aimed at bringing about a\n            radical change in the procedures for planning and managing\n            water resource use in Tamil Nadu."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Tamil Nadu Water Resources\n            Consolidation Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Tamil Nadu Water\n            Resources Consolidation Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/11/698774/india-tamil-nadu-water-resources-consolidation-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"IN-Tamil Nadu Wrcp -- P010476","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"India","authors":{"authr":"H.R.
