The effective Bank\n            assistance in identifying the main policy issues, and in\n            designing the reform program to address those issues,\n            analogous with the Government's strong commitment to\n            the reform program, were conducive to satisfactory\n            performances, despite delays in public enterprise\n            restructuring. Two key lessons suggest, first, that while\n            single tranche operations, are efficient, their finance\n            assistance should be tied to the budget cycle, to provide\n            compensatory financing for a reform program, and\n            effectiveness, if made at the beginning of the\n            Government's fiscal year, so as to ease management of a\n            predictable budget. Second, project financing address the\n            issue of public financial management reform, which although\n            central to the project, was limited by donor practices.\n            These practices tie donor financing to specific projects,\n            and are administered outside the budgetary system, leading\n            to delays in budget performance; but, if a larger share of\n            Bank assistance is channeled through the budget, along with\n            an intense dialogue on the subject of public funds use, the\n            budget process could substantially improve. This would\n            require well prepared program budgets in all sectors, within\n            a medium-term Government expenditure policy, focused on\n            accountability, and auditing,
