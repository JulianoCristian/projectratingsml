The main lessons from the Second Power project\n            concern the importance, prior to Board approval, of\n            addressing procurement policies, and procedures that could\n            create problems, and delays later; the need for a truly\n            independent regulatory regime to govern tariff\n            determination, in order to help safeguard the sector's\n            financial viability; and, the importance of rigorously\n            assessing risk, and identifying exit mechanisms for project\n            components, in areas of civil unrest. Conversely, the ESDP\n            yielded the following lessons of broad applicability, as the\n            Bank expands its assistance for renewable energy, as part of\n            its 2001 Energy Business Renewable Strategy, and 2003\n            Infrastructure Plan. These lessons can be clustered around\n            three important areas: a) building-up the business and\n            policy environment, addressing in particular the key barrier\n            of access to capital; b) scaling-up the market, including a\n            reliable after-sales service system, and end-user training;\n            and, c) establishing strong project, and financial\n            management systems, including monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -

The\n            lessons learned indicate that one of the key barriers for\n            private entrepreneurs and households was access to\n            additional capital for energy investments, each of them with\n            their own set of reasons. For all of the private developers\n            involved in the project, the strengthening of a business\n            enabling environment was of a key importance. The\n            introduction of a new industry coincides with learning of\n            new skills within almost all organizations involved.\n            Introduction of new technology in a sector as well as in a\n            company often needs to be driven by sound economic rationale\n            and market principles. For the introduction of the\n            alternative energy systems in Sri Lanka, two fundamental\n            principles were followed: (i) the system need to be the\n            least-cost option compared to its competitor products (grid\n            connected mini hydro projects); or, (ii) the incremental\n            cost of the systems need to be in-line with the incremental\n            cost globally and have a clear declining path of these costs\n            due to economies of scale (solar home systems and village\n            hydro projects). Initial market surveys and pre-investment\n            studies scoped the market for the new technology systems.\n            One of the major reasons for the success of the Energy\n            Service Delivery is that project design was flexible enough\n            to allow different approaches and changes as and when\n            required. Sound project management and financial management\n            are enabling factors. Competent financial management and\n            project management staff in both implementing agencies were\n            enabling factors for successful project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -

The second component would finance a\n            pilot grid-connected wind farm project to be executed by the\n            Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).  This pilot project is\n            expected to demonstrate the commercial viability and\n            long-run economic potential of wind power in Sri Lanka, and\n            to catalyze future private sector wind farm development.\n            The third component, the capacity building component, will\n            provide training and technical support for renewable energy\n            and energy efficiency initiatives by both the public and\n            private sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Energy Services Delivery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Energy
