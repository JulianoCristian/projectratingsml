The audit confirms the following lessons. The\n            freedom to operate according to market principles\n            potentially makes the operational efficiency of privately\n            run concessions, superior to that of parastatal\n            organizations for ports and railways. Thus, the\n            concentration of investment with high volumes of traffic,\n            lower operational costs, and relative autonomy from\n            government, generally makes port concessions a relatively\n            low risk for investors. Yet, if railways are likely to incur\n            losses, and/or are inadequately compensated for uneconomic\n            services, investors will be hard to come, and therefore\n            bidding conditions, and the terms of the concession\n            agreement will need to take this fact into account. The\n            design of projects preparing parastatal companies for\n            privatization should also consider the capacity, and\n            commitment of government, and management to carry through\n            the reform process. Targets and timetables should be\n            realistic, and, special care should be placed in the\n            selection of qualified consultants preparing bidding documentation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Secod Port Modernization and\n            Railway Restructuring Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Secod Port\n            Modernization and Railway Restructuring Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6074299/tanzania-secod-port-modernization-railway-restructuring-projects","projn":"TZ-Railways Restructuri -- P002757,TZ-Ports Modernization -- P002784","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050719110307"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Railways,Roads and highways,Ports, waterways and shipping","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, accounting procedures, actions,\n            autonomy, Bank management, Bank Performance, beneficiaries,\n            berth, cargo, cargo handling, cargo handling equipment,\n            Cargo Traffic, civil works, commercial services, concession\n            agreement, congestion, construction, container berths,\n            container operations, Container Services, container storage\n            area, container storage areas, container terminal, container\n            terminals, container traffic, containers, Corridor, cost of\n            capital, Customs, customs clearance, customs clearance\n            agents, customs procedures, depots, development objectives,\n            domestic traffic, dry cargo, economic conditions, financial\n            management, financial performance, Fiscal Year, flexibility,\n            foreign exchange, freight, freight traffic, handling\n            equipment, Holding Company, improvements, Institutional\n            Development, landlocked countries, lighterage, manifests,\n            natural resources, net loss, passenger, peer review, Port\n            equipment, ports, present value, private concessionaire,\n            private sector, privatization, productivity, project\n            completion, Public Sector, quality at entry, range,\n            refugees, rural development, savings, sector work, shippers,\n            shipping, stakeholders, Sub-Saharan Africa, supervision,\n            surcharges, sustainability, technical assistance, terminal\n            operations, trade logistics, traffic, traffic Components,\n            traffic volume, transit, Transport, trucks"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"32659"},"888109":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/12/888109/tanzania-second-port-modernization-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/12/888109/tanzania-second-port-modernization-project","new_url":"2000/12/888109/tanzania-second-port-modernization-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/02/17/000094946_01020105324181/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/02/17/000094946_01020105324181/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"2095","docdt":"2000-12-28T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2001-02-17T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Second Port Modernization Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project outcome is satisfactory,\n            sustainability is likely, and institutional development\n            impacts are substantial. Regardless of success, key lessons\n            convey that: 1) by and large, raising port services levels\n            to international standards, is not usually feasible within\n            the public sector framework. Therefore, it is essential that\n            an appropriate institutional framework involve private\n            sector participation, to sustain improvements to port\n            systems, by creating domestic competition, leading to\n            regional competition, and/or concession agreements, forcible\n            enough to obtain regulations protecting public interests,\n            but under an appropriate institutional framework; 2)\n            divestiture programs should be undertaken by institutions\n            not related to the enterprise undergoing restructuring,\n            while the privatization policy should be central to the\n            macroeconomic policy framework, to ensure an objective\n            approach to divestiture, and in turn, provide an appropriate\n            political backing to the process; 3) changing circumstances,\n            or project performance itself, may lead to unforeseen\n            negative results, such as waste of resources on components\n            with negligible impacts, but a flexible project design may\n            prevent, and/or facilitate such resources to more critical\n            investments; and, 4) given the superb project coordination,\n            the complexity of the project did not preclude success,\n            however, records management should be considered at project
