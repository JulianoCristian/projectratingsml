In this\n            context, the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) planned to\n            increase access to electricity to 50 percent in five years,\n            under the universal access expansion program (UAEP), which\n            will be implemented by the state-owned utility Ethiopian\n            electric power corporation (EEPCo). However, despite the\n            government\u2019s efforts to expand the hydro-generation capacity\n            and the electricity network, the pace of access to\n            electricity services remained slow. In 2008, a global\n            partnership on output-based aid (GPOBA) grant of 8 million\n            dollars was signed to accelerate the pace of connections\n            among grid customers by making the connection charge\n            affordable to the poor population through a credit scheme. A\n            socio-economic assessment funded by GPOBA suggests that\n            living and working conditions in the households benefiting\n            from electricity connections under the project have\n            generally improved.

The lessons learned from this project\n            were as followed: Outsourcing connections requires the\n            establishment/enforcement of effective quality control\n            mechanisms; A proper assessment of utility's practice\n            and technical and safety standards of connections is needed\n            to avoid a high rate of connection rectification after\n            verification; Risk of a negative impact of supporting a\n            major connection program on the electricity supply-demand\n            balance should be carefully assessed; In a low capacity\n            environment, even when relying on an existing institution,\n            it is important to assess the institution\u0092s ability to\n            coordinate internally to assure successful implementation of\n            the proposed activity; Since poor rural hhs targeted by\n            GPOBA grants do not provide a significant revenue stream to\n            the service provider, analyzing the government pro-poor\n            access policy and crafting incentives for utilities to reach\n            low income hhs is crucial in project design; All major\n            barriers to access should be addressed by OBA financing; and\n            OBA innovative projects may require flexibility in order to\n            make adjustments to the design during implementation to\n            achieve the PDO in a changing sector or country specific environment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia -

There are three components to the project.\n            The first component of the project is subsidy. The Global\n            Partnership Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) subsidy is a three year\n            program consisting of a payment of US$35 per connected\n            households (hh) to EEPCo in order to help the utility defray\n            its working capital costs of providing a five year loan to\n            the customer. The second component of the project is output\n            monitoring and verification (M&V)/auditing. This\n            component will finance the monitoring and verification of\n            outputs and auditing over the three year period. In\n            addition, the project will be subject to an external audit.\n            An independent credible organization, yet to be identified,\n            will be contracted. The third component of the project is\n            the World Bank (WB) supervision to be performed over the\n            three years of the GPOBA project. The project supervision\n            covers the work of the task team leader, the technical\n            specialists, and the fiduciary and safeguards staff for the\n            supervision of GPOBA subsidies. Supervision will take place\n            in conjunction with the other three energy access projects\n            currently financed by the WB, which will enable a reduction\n            in costs and better synergy among the multiple\n            electrification efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Electricity Access Rural\n            Expansion Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Electricity Access\n            Rural Expansion Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/04/10810024/ethiopia-electricity-access-rural-expansion-project","projn":"ET-Ethiopia Electricity Access Rural\n            Expansion Project, Phase II - -- P105651","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"m,Access to Finance,Debt Markets,E-Business,Energy Production and Transportation","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Ethiopia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20090714024347"},"theme":"Rural services and infrastructure","subsc":"Power","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to electricity, access to service,\n            administrative process, affordability, alternative fuels,\n            amortization, annual income, Availability, balance, Bank\n            Borrowers, Bank Supervision, barrier to entry, basic needs,\n            batteries, beneficiaries, beneficiary, Biomass, capital\n            costs, circuit breakers, Collection efficiency, Compact\n            Fluorescent Lamps, Competitive Bidding, consumer, consumers,\n            Contribution, contributions, cost increase, cost of\n            electricity, cost of energy, cost recovery, credit\n            institutions, credit program, credits, cross-subsidies,\n            customer services, Default rate, Development Bank, direct\n            connection, Disbursement, disbursements, distribution\n            network, domestic market, donor funding, down payment,\n            drought, economic activity, economic analysis, Economic\n            Development, economic growth, educational services, Electric\n            Power, Electricity, electricity consumption, electricity\n            utility, electrification, Employment, energy conservation,\n            energy consumption, energy efficiency, energy needs, energy\n            savings, Exchange Rate, Expenditure, expenditures, families,\n            family income, Financial Analysis, financial capacity,\n            Financial Management, Financial Reports, Fluorescent Lamp,\n            free loan, Gender, generation, government policy,\n            households, human development, implementing agencies,\n            implementing agency, income, Innovation, installation,\n            installments, interest payments, interest rate, internal\n            processes, Internal Rate of Return, International\n            Development, investing, investment climate, investment\n            program, kerosene, kerosene lamps, Kilowatt hour, loan, loan\n            agreement, loan amount, loan documents, loan program,\n            maintenance costs, material, micro-credit, monthly payment,\n            natural gas, natural resource, nominal interest rate, oil,\n            oil price, operating costs, performance indicators, physical\n            connection, pollution, Power Corporation, Present Value,\n            price volatility, principal payments, private property,\n            Procurement, profit margin, radio, radios, Rate of Return,\n            Reduction in time, regulatory framework, repayment,\n            repayment period, responsibilities, results, revolving fund,\n            Risk Mitigation, risk sharing, rural electrification,\n            savings, Senior, service provider, source of fuel, source of\n            information, Subsidy funding, Supervision, targets, Tariff\n            Structure, tariff system, total cost, Total costs,\n            Transaction, transmission, treasury, universal access, urban\n            areas, user, User Fees, uses, Utilities, utility company,\n            variable cost, verification, village, villages, woman, wood\n            fuel, working capital"}},"owner":"Urban, Rural & Soc Dev - Gbl OBA (GSUOA)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF055657-GPOBA - PMU SUPERVISION (15%)","majtheme":"Rural development","repnb":"49299"},"facets":{}}}
