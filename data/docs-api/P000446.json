The project would\n            include the following main components: (a) preparation of a\n            road-rehabilitation program, and preparation and start-up of\n            an integrated cotton/food-crop project; (b) sector studies\n            to review the organizational, financial, and legal setups of\n            the important diamond and forestry sectors; (c) provision of\n            resident technical advisors to assist in the preparation and\n            implementation of development projects, and in monitoring\n            the external debt; (d) vehicles and operating expenses for\n            the resident advisers; (e) an organizational review of the\n            civil service, with recommendations for modest, short-term\n            improvements; and (f) provision of funds for further\n            studies, training, consulting services, and related needs to\n            be identified during project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African
