Some lessons learned\n            included: the flexibility combined with opportunism enabled\n            the project to engage with emerging Government of Aceh (GOA)\n            priorities, such as Aceh Forest Redesign Team (Tim\n            Penyusunan Rencana Strategis Pengelolaan Hutan Aceh)\n            (TIPERESKA) and green Aceh, leveraging resources toward\n            sustainability that were not originally envisioned. The\n            project can thus accomplish much more by joining and\n            strengthening these initiatives. The forest monitoring\n            program clearly illustrated that reporting needs to go\n            beyond simple monitoring to include engaging governmental\n            units in understanding and taking up the information for\n            further action. Government action is essential on some\n            fronts, especially for law enforcement and prosecution. In\n            addition, demonstrating how conservation and protection\n            activities directly benefit communities is more effective\n            than rhetoric alone. Seconding staff into the administrative\n            and political structure and supporting the governor's\n            key environmental initiatives was effective at integrating\n            project aims into the policy and decision process. In\n            addition, working directly with teachers and schools was a\n            good entry point and expanded the reach of the project\n            beyond what it can do with its own resources. Through good\n            plans and partnerships, an environmental project can\n            leverage resources for its stakeholder communities,\n            including vulnerable groups like the poor or women. There is\n            also scope for developing wider business development efforts\n            and marketing linkages, but the implementing non-government\n            organizations (NGOs) have to also recognize their core\n            mission and comparative advantage if stretched too far in\n            this direction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Integrating Environment and\n

It is anticipated that\n            few members of local communities will be adversely impacted\n            by this project. This is because the project does not\n            primarily seek to prevent access to forest resources but to\n            limit and regulate such resource use to ensure no further\n            forest loss. However, the project may seek to prevent access\n            to certain resources or certain areas through zoning. Also,\n            access to specific species may be curtailed or prevented.\n            The project will also employ appropriate, participatory\n            marking of forest boundaries. When this project does\n            identify adverse impacts - or a need to change livelihood\n            strategies (e.g., illegal loggers), local community members\n            will be directly assisted to take up alternate livelihood\n            opportunities, which may be sponsored by the project or\n            other non-government organizations (NGOs) and development\n            agencies working in the area. Community development\n            activities (e.g., nursery development, provision of seed\n            stock, assistance in land rehabilitation) will be targeted\n            to community members who are most vulnerable or most likely\n            to engage in forest encroaching activities, unless otherwise\n            employed. The project will ensure that community members\n            identified will be assisted with remedial measures necessary\n            to maintain or improve their incomes or living standards.\n            Further, appropriate mitigation measures will be identified\n            with the participation of the affected communities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Integrating Environment and\n

acceptable to the communities who are\n            identified as key stakeholders in the management of forests;\n            b) to ensure full consultation and participation of local\n            people, identified as being most relevant to the management\n            of local forests; and c) to avoid, minimize, or mitigate\n            potentially adverse effects of new restrictions and\n
