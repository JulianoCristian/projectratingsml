Lessons show that\n            adapting an effective, agricultural extension management\n            system to the conditions of the country, substantially\n            exceed the high costs involved in establishing and modifying\n            extension management, as based on the increased\n            productivity. Whereas support by adaptive and participative\n            agricultural research is necessary, initially though, the\n            best practices of existing traditional known technology, may\n            well provide the adequate training material, tested on\n            farmers' fields, further allowing substantial\n            productivity, and income improvements. Although the cotton\n            sector was not specifically included in the project, an\n            important lesson drawn from the project suggests that\n            specific measures could have been taken to support a sector\n            as critical as cotton is in Chad, following the decline of\n            cotton prices. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and\n            bilateral agencies can be effective implementation agencies\n            for special types of components, though not necessarily less\n            expensive than Government agencies. To this end, the high\n            administrative, and operational costs absorbed by NGOs,\n            require that measures be developed to reduce costs. The use\n            of producer organizations as a basis for village\n            investments, provide benefits beyond those strictly\n            economic: provides a forum to fight HIV/AIDS; promotes the\n            position of women; and, improves communal, environmental understanding."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad -

The specific objectives of the project are\n            to: 1) reshape extension into an effective service\n            addressing farmer's needs for improved crop and\n            livestock production as well as for natural resources\n            management; 2) strengthen linkages between extension and\n            research focusing on participatory and adaptive research;\n            and 3) strengthen and build up producer's\n            organizations. The components of the project are as follows:\n            1) extension service activities which will progressively\n            cover the country's fourteen \"prefectures\",\n            for crop and livestock production, and natural resource\n            management; 2) the establishment of a minimum research\n            capacity, through collaboration among researchers, producers\n            and extension agents, to develop, test and promote improved\n            production practices and technologies; and 3) the\n            enhancement of the capacity of producers'\n            organizations, through training and technical assistance, to\n            carry out group activities such as crop and produce\n            marketing, management and distribution of farm inputs,\n

increase agricultural productivity in an environmentally\n            sustainable manner, to improve producers' incomes, and\n            to rationalize the use of public resources in support of\n            rural services. The specific objectives of the project are\n            to: 1) reshape extension into an effective service\n            addressing farmer's needs for improved crop and\n            livestock production as well as for natural resources\n            management; 2) strengthen linkages between extension and\n            research focusing on participatory and adaptive research;\n            and 3) strengthen and build up producer's\n            organizations. The components of the project are as follows:\n            1) extension service activities which will progressively\n            cover the country's fourteen \"prefectures\",\n            for crop and livestock production, and natural resource\n            management; 2) the establishment of a minimum research\n            capacity, through collaboration among researchers, producers\n            and extension agents, to develop, test and promote improved\n            production practices and technologies; and 3) the\n            enhancement of the capacity of producers'\n            organizations, through training and technical assistance, to\n            carry out group activities such as crop and produce\n            marketing, management and distribution of farm inputs,\n            maintenance of agricultural equipment and basic animal\n            health care."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Agricultural and Livestock Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chad
