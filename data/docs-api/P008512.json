The strategy of using the\n            Rehabilitation Credit as an umbrella operation for\n            initiating a comprehensive reform program to be followed by\n            subsequent adjustment operations worked well, as evidenced\n            by the approval of four follow-up operations. The\n            preparation of a Social Sector Adjustment operation is now\n            underway. Other operations emphasize further support for\n            agriculture and rural development. Among the key lessons\n            learned are: 1) Government ownership and commitment is the\n            key to success. The Government understood the process of\n            adjustment and had made a rapid beginning, even prior to\n            project approval. 2) Project design and implementation\n            arrangements should be simple and clear at the outset.\n            However, flexibility is critical. 3) Managerial\n            responsibility and lines of communication within\n            International Development Association and with the Borrower\n            should be clear and continuity stressed. Task managers\n            should remain with a project from design through\n            implementation and assignation of sub-task manager authority\n            should be minimized. Complex multi-sectoral operations of\n            this nature should be managed from the field, both reduce\n            confused signals and to accelerate problem-solving."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz

of foreign exchange and minimizing further\n            contraction of economic activity; (iv) to stimulate foreign\n            exchange markets and enhance private sector access to\n            foreign exchange; and (v) to provide priority technical\n            assistance in the key structural reform areas, which will\n            facilitate implementation of the program and build up\n            overall implementation capacity in the country.
