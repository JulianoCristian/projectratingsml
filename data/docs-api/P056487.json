The lesson learned indicated that although\n            Government is committed to policy reform and to improvements\n            in the legal and regulatory framework, enforcement of the\n            new regulations can be hindered by governance issues and\n            institutional shortcomings. Improvement of the state's\n            ability to regulate public policy so as to create a positive\n            environment for the development of a more dynamic mining\n            sector, which would allow the affected communities to\n            benefit directly from a surge in activities, is a crucial\n            aspect of the project. Emphasis on beneficiary participation\n            in project preparation, implementation and monitoring are\n            critical for timely and effective implementation. Lack of\n            detailed baseline information and adequate institutional\n            capacity make improving governance in the small-scale mining\n            area through technical assistance a particularly difficult\n            task. Improving the enabling environment increases the\n            ability of a country to attract and retain appropriate\n            private investment. The last 25 years have seen significant\n            changes in the international mining industry, in large\n            measure because of the liberalization of economic and mining\n            policies of previously restrictive governments in mining\n            countries. These reforms have had three broad objectives, to\n            improve sector performance and growth, and the contribution\n            of mining to the national economies, to ensure the\n            sustainability of the mining industries in the developing\n            countries, and to ensure that the host countries and local\n            populations get a fair share from the benefits of growth of\n            the sector. World Bank involvement in the reform process of\n            successful mining countries shows that, for this to happen,\n            the enactment of the necessary legal, fiscal and\n            environmental policies and the establishment of strong\n            mining institutions to implement and administer them have\n            proven to be the keys to success."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Mining Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar - Mining Sector Reform
