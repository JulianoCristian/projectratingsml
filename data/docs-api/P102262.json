Some lessons learned included:\n            revisit assumptions made during appraisal on a regular\n            basis, listen to feed-back and, in response, restructure\n            rather early than late. There were feed-back loops, and red\n            flags did in fact show indicating that results achievement\n            was not on track - but they were put aside in favor of other\n            priorities: The challenges the project faced in matching the\n            anticipated results chain could have been addressed at a\n            time when a turnaround would still have been possible. The\n            impact of a changes or additions to the results framework is\n            negligible, when they come in a late stage such as the last\n            year of implementation. One of the more structural issues\n            this project suffered from might be related to a comparative\n            marginalization vis-a-vis interventions on the mainland:\n            compared to operations in education and other sectors in\n            mainland Tanzania, this was a rather small project, on an\n            island separated physically and politically from the\n            mainland. Perhaps due to its relative isolation and the\n            sensitive political economy between the Tanzania federal\n            government and Zanzibar, the project did not receive the\n            assistance it needed from the mainland government, (at least\n            not in the early stages of project implementation)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Zanzibar Basic Education\n

Zanzibar Basic\n            Education Improvement Project for Tanzania is to improve\n            completion of lower secondary education with successful\n            performance among students. The original project design\n            included three Project Development Objective (PDO)\n            Indicators and ten intermediate outcome indicators to\n            monitor progress towards the PDO. Overall, the PDO remains\n            valid/ relevant and continues to be achievable, even though\n            a modest extension of project closing date will be needed to\n            complete all outstanding activities The modifications for\n            this project restructuring are: (i) to allocate unallocated\n            amount and reallocate savings across categories to finance\n            critical activities that are in need of additional\n            resources; (ii) to change PDO indicators target values;\n            (iii) to add a new PDO indicator; and (iv) to extend the\n            project closing date by four months. The changes will not\n            affect the formulation of the PDO. They will help to\n            consolidate and strengthen various on-going activities\n            across components and categories, complete all planned\n            activities across components and categories before closing,\n            and meet the PDO as measured by related outcome indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Zanzibar Basic\n            Education Improvement Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) :\n            Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2013/04/17623836/tanzania-zanzibar-basic-education-improvement-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"TZ-Zanzibar Basic Education Improvement\n            Project -- P102262","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Education For All,Teaching and Learning,Access & Equity in Basic  Education,Tertiary Education","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000445729_20130424142405"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Secondary education,Primary education","theme":"Education for all,HIV/AIDS,Gender,Environmental policies and institutions","lang":"English","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":",,"}},"owner":"Education - East/Southern (AFTEE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"74456"},"17623831":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/03/17623831/tanzania-zanzibar-basic-education-improvement-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/03/17623831/tanzania-zanzibar-basic-education-improvement-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","new_url":"2013/03/17623831/tanzania-zanzibar-basic-education-improvement-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","disclosure_date":"2013-04-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2013-04-24T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2013-04-24T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/04/24/000445729_20130424141725/Rendered/INDEX/744560PJPR0v100377287B00PUBLIC00ACS.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/04/24/000445729_20130424141725/Rendered/PDF/744560PJPR0v100377287B00PUBLIC00ACS.pdf","credit_no":"4293","datestored":"2013-04-24T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2013-03-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Zanzibar Basic Education\n            Improvement Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Zanzibar Basic\n            Education Improvement Project for Tanzania is to improve\n            completion of lower secondary education with successful\n            performance among students.
