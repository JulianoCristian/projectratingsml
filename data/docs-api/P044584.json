Some lessons learned included: The social and\n            environmental assessments and institutional and economic\n            analyses are important aspects of project preparation that\n            allow a good knowledge of the local conditions and a\n            tailored approach. These studies are most useful during\n            implementation and can be used to establish the baselines\n            for project monitoring. A flexible project design is\n            important in a post-conflict situation, in order to adapt to\n            the development pace of the country, and in the case of\n            PDSTP, the evolution of the executing agency. In a country\n            recovering from a severe social conflict and with low\n            implementation capacity, like Djibouti, the project targets\n            and timetables must be realistic so as to make them\n            reasonable to achieve. All the associated risks must be\n            flagged up front. It is also advisable to foresee an\n            implementation in clear phases that can achieve results at a\n            reasonable pace. Community participation is fundamental to\n            ensure project ownership, better care of the infrastructure,\n            and to motivate change within the beneficiary communities.\n            Neighborhood improvement projects should be developed after\n            a thorough neighborhood development plan, including\n            community participation, is prepared and validated. In the\n            case of the PDSTP the use of certain facilities and its care\n            and maintenance were below expectations at the beginning of\n            the project when the social development component was not\n            yet operational. This situation was reversed once the\n            communities were involved in project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Djibouti - Social Development and Public\n            Works
