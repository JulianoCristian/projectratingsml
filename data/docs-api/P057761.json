Some of the\n            lessons learned included: readiness for implementation at\n            approval is critical for achievement of planned\n            implementation schedules. Institutional arrangements are\n            particularly important for successful project design and\n            implementation. Implementation of multi sectorial projects\n            requires strong and effective coordination by government at\n            a range of levels. The bank's performance during\n            preparation and implementation is critically important\n            towards achievement of development outcomes, particularly\n            for projects set in weaker institutional environments and\n            for multi-sectorial works. Timely and thorough mid-term\n            reviews and restructuring are important to the achievement\n            of development outcomes and performance ratings. Well\n            defined internal bank systems are required for effective\n            support to multi-sectorial projects. And further analytical\n            work will strengthen and support the contextual\n            appropriateness and benefits associated with the\n            multi-sectorial approach and role of local governments in\n            the delivery of services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Infrastructure Service Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi - Infrastructure Service
