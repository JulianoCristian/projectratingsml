Lessons\n            learned from this project at preparation and lending\n            include: 1) The project confirms the success of earlier\n            development models, based on farmer participation in all\n            phases of planning, investment, and operation. 2) It has\n            taken three project cycles to reach what can be regarded as\n            fully sustainable development in this case. This reflects a\n            need to take a long-term view of institutional change and of\n            the preparation of beneficiaries for full participation. 3)\n            The project succeeded because of strong financial incentives\n            for beneficiaries. These in turn require sound technical and\n            economic evaluation of investments and careful selection of\n            priorities and open and transparent processes for site\n            selection. In terms of implementation, operation, and\n            maintenance, a) the main problems have been in the role and\n            functioning of the public sector, especially in the release\n            of funds and their synchronization with construction\n            schedules, public procurement, account compilation,\n            financial management, and timely disbursement. b) The\n            critical role of public services is also evidenced by the\n            project, especially technical support to farmer groups. c)\n            The project orientation towards promotion of private sector\n            investment in service delivery aspect should be encouraged\n            right from the outset with proper investment regulations and rules."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal -
