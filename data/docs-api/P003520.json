The\n            objectives to increase efficiency in the utilization and\n            management of existing facilities and to support expansion\n            of economic activity were substantially achieved. The\n            objectives to improve overall city planning and management\n            and to strengthen resource mobilization varied by city and\n            by sector. Bank performance during preparation and\n            supervision was broadly satisfactory. However, there were\n            some notable deficiencies relating to the ambitious scope of\n            the project and a lack of early continuity in the project\n            team. Borrower performance was satisfactory given the\n            complexity of the project and inexperience of the\n            municipalities, but was uneven among cities.\n            Changzhou's performance was excellent, Luoyang's\n            adequate overall, and Shashi's less than satisfactory.\n            The sustainability of project achievements is likely, as:\n            the new or improved approaches introduced under the project\n            are consistent with the country's overall transition;\n            the assets created under the project are valuable to the\n            economies; and responsibilities for operation and\n            maintenance of the assets are clear and the organizations\n            responsible have the necessary financial and institutional\n            capacities. Key lessons learned are as follows.\n            Multi-sectoral projects in urban areas are both needed and\n            feasible. These projects could provide a better platform for\n            improvement of broad urban management systems and sectoral\n            policies, compared with single-sector projects. However,\n            they pose significant difficulties and risks. They require\n            investment of substantial borrower and Bank resources\n            throughout the project cycle. Policy and institutional\n            development goals must be clearly defined and feasible."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Medium-Sized Cities Development
