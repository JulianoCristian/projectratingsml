Lessons address: 1) on the technical\n            aspect, the integrated health services model represents a\n            major contribution to health reform, for the operational\n            side of preventive integrated care, and the Ministry of\n            Health should ensure the strengthening of central, and\n            regional planning capability, with special attention on\n            morbidity, and mortality reductions. Promotion of health,\n            and nutrition practices still require substantial\n            development, while social marketing of health services,\n            should focus on a larger role within information, education\n            and communication programs, including community health work,\n            within an organized supportive system. Similarly, local\n            nongovernmental organizations can play a supporting role to\n            the health sector by strengthening community health, and,\n            training should be relevant to public sector management;\n            and, 2) on the implementation aspect, sustainability\n            planning should be strengthened, with more regional\n            decision-making in project design; greater focus on\n            strengthening regional management capacity is needed; and,\n            legal approvals for operating under a pilot project\n            framework should be enacted. Although implementation\n            contracting (third-party) was effective, rigid terms of\n            reference caused pitfalls; rather, a team of specialists\n            could be contracted at a set price, with specific products,\n            negotiated as needed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru -

The project area covers 15\n            provinces in three regions and one area of greater Lima.\n            Most of the populations in the provinces are mountain\n            communities which include a significant share of indigenous\n            people and of the extremely poor. In Lima, the district\n            covered by the project is one of the poorest of the city.\n            The emphasis in the project will be on preventive care in\n            the areas of reproductive health and the health of infants\n            and young children. In addition to strengthening activities\n            such as the follow-up of pregnant women, child growth\n            monitoring and micronutrient supplementation, more demand\n            for preventive services will be generated through an\n            integrated information, education and communications (IEC)\n            component. The project will finance basic medical equipment;\n            vehicles for supervision; medicine, micronutrients and other\n            supplies; computers; office, printing and laboratory\n            equipment; and basic instructional materials for health\n            facilities. The project will furthermore cover the costs of\n            operational research and technical assistance aimed at\n            strengthening services and testing innovative strategies to\n            improve delivery and quality. The project will finance\n            services contracted to develop and conduct mass media\n            campaigns as well as the production and distribution of\n            printed and audiovisual materials for the IEC program.

The project area covers 15\n            provinces in three regions and one area of greater Lima.\n            Most of the populations in the provinces are mountain\n            communities which include a significant share of indigenous\n            people and of the extremely poor. In Lima, the district\n            covered by the project is one of the poorest of the city.\n            The emphasis in the project will be on preventive care in\n            the areas of reproductive health and the health of infants\n            and young children. In addition to strengthening activities\n            such as the follow-up of pregnant women, child growth\n            monitoring and micronutrient supplementation, more demand\n            for preventive services will be generated through an\n            integrated information, education and communications (IEC)\n            component. The project will finance basic medical equipment;\n            vehicles for supervision; medicine, micronutrients and other\n            supplies; computers; office, printing and laboratory\n            equipment; and basic instructional materials for health\n            facilities. The project will furthermore cover the costs of\n            operational research and technical assistance aimed at\n            strengthening services and testing innovative strategies to\n            improve delivery and quality.
