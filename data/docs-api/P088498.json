    development into a knowledge-based economy, by strengthening\n            its tertiary education system. To this end, the financing\n            system for tertiary education will be revamped in order to\n            enhance the quality, and relevance of tertiary education;\n            ensure access to tertiary education; and, improve internal\n            efficiency, and accountability for results. The Tertiary\n            Education Finance for Results Project's development\n            objective is to increase the effectiveness of public funding\n            for tertiary education, so as to enhance coherence,\n            responsiveness, and, equity and quality in the system,\n            through stronger accountability for performance. The project\n            has two main components as follows. The first component will\n            strengthen the institutional framework for tertiary\n            education. It entails: improved sector oversight, and\n            regulation; strong policies and strategies for tertiary\n            education; consolidation of the national system for quality\n            assurance; establishment of a national observatory within\n            tertiary education; and, project management activities. The\n            second component comprises sub-projects to enhance\n            coherence, efficiency, equity and quality. These subprojects\n            will be innovative within tertiary programs, and, shall\n            stimulate institutional effectiveness in critical areas,\n            implemented through performance agreements. Beyond the\n            program, the goal is to support the Government in completing\n            the transition from the current funding system, to a\n            performance-based system applied to an agreed proportion of\n            base funding for universities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile -
