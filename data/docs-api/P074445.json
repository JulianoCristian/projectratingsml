Some lessons learned\n            included: the design and sequencing of reforms need to take\n            into account the track record of the government especially\n            in those areas that have been chosen by the operation. This\n            will ensure that expected outcomes can be more realistic and\n            focused on reforms in areas where chances of success are\n            higher. In order to improve accountability that will lead to\n            better implementation of reforms, there is a need for\n            strengthening the link between the poverty reduction budget\n            support (PRBS) processes and other national processes\n            through the sectoral advisory groups (SAGs). This will\n            enable increased involvement of other stakeholders such as\n            civil society and parliament. It must be recognized that\n            operating in a donor harmonized framework can lead to\n            trade-offs, especially since policies governing budget\n            support can differ between some donors and the Bank. The\n            limits of using a single instrument to achieve multiple\n            objectives (e.g. harmonization, predictability, contribution\n            and encouragement to reforms) need to be acknowledged.\n            Consistent dialogue among donors and between donors and\n            government can lead to improvements in the content of the\n            performance assessment framework (PAF)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Second Economic Management and\n            Growth Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zambia - Second Economic\n            Management and Growth

robust\n            growth; 2) strengthening the credibility and institutional\n            capacity of the public sector; and 3) enhancing\n            Zambia's growth opportunities while improving
