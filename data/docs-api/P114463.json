Some lessons learned include: constraints to\n            political capacity can derail even a non-controversial\n            program of reforms. In the case of the Maldives, the nascent\n            democracy and inexperienced government had limited political\n            capacity to convince stakeholders (i.e. parliament) of the\n            need for difficult reforms. In such cases, limiting the\n            scope of reforms to only the most urgent and essential may\n            be necessary. Constraints to technical capacity need to be\n            realistically assessed and addressed. It may be useful to\n            explicitly build technical assistance into the program to\n            ensure resources are readily available when needed. It\n            should also be noted that, even if sufficient resources are\n            devoted to technical assistance, absorptive capacity may be\n            a constraint. The sustainability of outcomes depends largely\n            on further support for reforms. The fact that the civil\n            service database was set up, but it has not been updated\n            since and doing so will require starting from scratch, is a\n            good example of how without continuous support for these\n            reforms the sustainability of the outcomes can be compromised."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Maldives - Economic Stabilization and\n            Recovery

It supports\n            the Government's reforms aimed at restoring fiscal\n            sustainability and its efforts to implement its medium-term\n            strategic action plan (SAP). Both the financing and the\n            policy actions supported by the operation come at a time\n            when there are initial signs of an economic recovery and\n            evidence that the Government's fiscal austerity\n            measures are helping to put the fiscal deficit on a\n            sustainable path. In this regard, the operation will\n            underpin economic growth by helping to reduce the large\n            macroeconomic imbalances that occurred in 2009. While the\n            2009 fiscal deficit is very high, fiscal austerity measures\n            and the improving economy are beginning to slowly turn the\n            situation around.
