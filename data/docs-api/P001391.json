Lessons learned were the following:\n            The project concept was conditioned on early precedents of\n            World Bank interventions in the country's financial and\n            industrial sectors. Today, reform priorities to support this\n            type of project would focus on private participation in\n            infrastructure, implementing necessary reforms to address\n            constraints in infrastructure, building effective financial\n            systems to finance the private sector, and building the\n            firms' capacity. Project design should be simple to\n            allow sufficient flexibility for changes and focused to keep\n            implementation manageable for the executing agencies. It\n            should avoid placing an undue burden on the agencies'\n            already weak capacity. Effective and timely project\n            monitoring and supervision by the Bank and the government\n            would have gone a long way to contributing the\n            project's success. In addition, the project should have\n            included performance-monitoring indicators to assess project\n            impact and the continued eligibility of the executing\n            agencies. The project did not establish an adequate\n            counterpart for overall project coordination and\n            supervision. Project implementation would have greatly\n            benefited from strong overall coordination, a monitoring and\n            reporting system, and a financial management system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho -

industrial and agroindustries sectors. The project broadly\n            addresses constraints to investment through interventions in\n            the financial sector, investment promotion, agroindustrial\n            development and strengthening of key industrial and\n            financial institutions. Project components are: (a) term\n            credit and an equity fund designed to increase access to\n            financial services currently not available in Lesotho; (b)\n            support for the commercial operation of key agroindustrial\n            parastatals through management contracts and training; (c)\n            support for timely provision of infrastructure for\n            industrial estates; and (d) institutional strengthening and\n            training to (i) strengthen investment promotion, (ii) build\n            the project appraisal and management capacity of financial\n            institutions, (iii) improve institutional performance of 3\n            corporations, (iv) train entrepreneurs and labor in\n            management and technical skills necessary to improve the\n            quality and competitiveness of Lesotho-made products, and\n            (v) carry out studies to identify reforms and services\n            needed to improve
