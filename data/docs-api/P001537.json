Lessons\n            learned from the soil and water component prove that\n            agricultural system intensification is a necessary, but not\n            sufficient, condition to reduce slash-and-burn agriculture.\n            More emphasis on land tenure security arrangements, improved\n            and enforced slash-and-burn regulations, and better markets\n            to ensure adequate supplies of food stuffs at reasonable and\n            predictable prices may be necessary to facilitate an\n            increased adoption of conservation agriculture technologies.\n            Effective implementation of sector-wide assistance programs,\n            such as NEAPS, requires close donor coordination,\n            particularly for a micro-project approach. A key lesson,\n            internalized midway through EP II, and corrected for in EP\n            III, is that unrealistic objectives and targets can\n            undermine the credibility of a program.

was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that It is\n            essential to formulate the project development objectives\n            (PDO) with maximum clarity, accuracy and realism in mind.\n            Robust and credible economic analysis of environmental\n            projects is important. In multi-phase programs, it is\n            important to define targets the achievement of which will\n            trigger the launch of the next program phase. Creation of\n            overly strong implementing agencies drains qualified staff\n            and lowers morale in the line ministries. To integrate\n            environmental program into the mainstream development\n            agenda, maximize development effectiveness and capture\n            potential synergies, environmental projects should\n            coordinate their focus and interventions with other\n            development projects in the country. Strategically placed\n            regional and local capacity for environmental management -\n            in terms of trained staff and basic office support - is\n            essential for efficient implementation of field-level\n            project activities in target zones. For complex projects\n            with a large number of multiple implementing agencies (key\n            implementing agencies, local governments, NGOs, independent\n            service providers)
