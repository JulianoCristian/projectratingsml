Financing for consulting engineering,\n            training and studies of further geothermal potential and the\n            next power project is included. The implementation and\n            financial risks are moderate. The technical risks appear to\n            be normal for such underground work, since seven of the\n            twelve wells already drilled have been producing steam for\n            an extended period. The engineering loan will finance: (i)\n            drilling equipment and supplies to drill production wells\n            for the recovery of steam at Olkaria sufficient to power an\n            electric generator with the capacity of 15 MW, to be\n            followed by further drilling for a second unit of 15 MW;\n            (ii) the cost of consultants for the preparation of\n            specifications for the drilling equipment and for the\n            supervision of the drilling program; (iii) the cost of\n            expatriate drill operators; and (iv) the training of local\n            personnel. The purpose of the drilling will be to provide\n            adequate quantities of steam at appropriate temperatures and\n            pressures for the Power III Project. The training element\n            will help KPC develop indigenous geothermal drilling\n            experience so that they may be capable of executing a\n            continuous drilling program. The risks appear to be normal\n            for such underground work, since five of the seven wells\n            already drilled have been producing steam."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Olkaria Geothermal Engineering Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Olkaria Geothermal\n            Engineering Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/10/1557053/kenya-olkaria-geothermal-engineering-project","projn":"KE-Power-Iii -- P001275","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Health Economics & Finance,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101902314067"},"subsc":"(Historic)Thermal","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural output,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,arable land,associated\n            companies,balance of payments,Bank Lending,Bank\n            loans,borrowing policy,capital formation,capital\n            goods,coal,commercial borrowing,commodities,consumers,cost\n            savings,Debt,debt service,deposits,development\n            strategy,diseconomies,distribution of income,economic\n            growth,Economic Structure,Electricity,employment,equity\n            capital,exchange rate,expenditures,export\n            growth,exports,feasibility studies,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,GNP,GNP PER CAPITA,gross fixed capital\n            formation,growth rate,housing,imports,income,income\n            distribution,industrialization,INFANT\n            MORTALITY,institutional development,labor force,LIFE\n            EXPECTANCY,net imports,nutrition,oil,oil prices,per capita\n            income,population growth,poverty alleviation,price\n            increases,public investment,public savings,real GDP,resource\n            mobilization,Roads,sales taxes,savings,social\n            services,tax,technical assistance,telecommunications,terms\n            of trade,transport,urban development,value added,wages,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural output,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,arable land,associated\n            companies,balance of payments,Bank Lending,Bank\n            loans,borrowing policy,capital formation,capital\n            goods,coal,commercial borrowing,commodities,consumers,cost\n            savings,Debt,debt service,deposits,development\n            strategy,diseconomies,distribution of income,economic\n            growth,Economic Structure,Electricity,employment,equity\n            capital,exchange rate,expenditures,export\n            growth,exports,feasibility studies,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,GNP,GNP PER CAPITA,gross fixed capital\n            formation,growth rate,housing,imports,income,income\n            distribution,industrialization,INFANT\n            MORTALITY,institutional development,labor force,LIFE\n            EXPECTANCY,net imports,nutrition,oil,oil prices,per capita\n            income,population growth,poverty alleviation,price\n            increases,public investment,public savings,real GDP,resource\n            mobilization,Roads,sales taxes,savings,social\n            services,tax,technical assistance,telecommunications,terms\n            of trade,transport,urban development,value added,wages,Water Supply"}},"owner":"WB Off: Nairobi - Eastern AFR 2 (AFCE2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"P2395"},"facets":{}}}
