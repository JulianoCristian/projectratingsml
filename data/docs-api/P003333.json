Among the many lessons learned, it is suggested\n            that AIDS has to be addressed massively, and in a\n            multi-sectoral manner, for the project clearly shows that\n            the narrow health focus, and the emphasis on\n            pharmaceuticals, made the project - though relevant - an\n            insufficient instrument in the fight against the epidemic.\n            Moreover, although simplicity in project design is often\n            praised, this made it dependent on parallel financing of\n            programmatic aspects; seemingly, such dependency can only be\n            allowed if either the Government, or the Bank takes\n            responsibility for supporting lagging components, or if\n            sector-wide arrangements are established. Consequently, the\n            project functioned well as a complementary project, but was\n            too narrow in scope to function on its own. In addition,\n            procurement of drugs, or supplies should be cognizant of the\n            multiple uses of such items, thus the requirement for these\n            to be strictly for

incidence and\n            impact of sexually transmitted infections in a\n            cost-effective manner. To achieve this goal, the project\n            will provide critical programmatic and commodity support to\n            the government's integrated and comprehensive program\n            for prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections\n            (STIs). The project focuses on strengthening detection and\n            cure of STDs, one of the most cost-effective interventions\n            to inhibit the spread of Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV)\n            infection. It also provides essential drugs and protective\n            supplies to enable the health care system to manage the\n            increased demands made by the Acquired Immune Deficiency\n            Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic. In particular, it will finance:\n            (a) condoms to ensure that Information, Education and\n            Communication efforts to change behavior and promote their\n            use are accompanied by adequate supplies; (b) STE program\n            support and drugs and diagnostic tests for STD control, one\n            of the most cost-effective interventions to inhibit the\n            spread of HIV and medically justifiable in its own right to\n            prevent STD complications and congenital disease; (c) drugs\n            to treat tuberculosis and other selected AIDS-opportunistic\n            infections; (d) tests and supplies for HIV diagnosis and\n            blood screening; and (e) protective supplies for health care\n            givers - gloves,
