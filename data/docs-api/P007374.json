The project had three basic objectives: i)\n            maintaining the structural integrity of the Morazan Dam; ii)\n            increasing the reliability of the power plants auxiliary\n            system, and thereby minimizing the risk of interruption of\n            the principal source of the country\u2019s electricity supply,\n            and iii) strengthening Empresa Nacional de Energia\n            Electrica's (ENEE) emergency preparedness planning and\n            its capacity to monitor the dam performance. The project\n            objectives were successfully achieved. Bank performance was\n            satisfactory. ENEE performance was satisfactory. The\n            following reflect the lessons learned: The first lesson is\n            that a borrower project team composed of qualified and\n            motivated staff, is a key factor for the successful\n            implementation of a project. A second lesson is that\n            flexibility of all parties and development of mutual trust\n            and respect among all factors involved in the project are\n            essential for successful implementation. A third lesson is\n            the confirmation of the importance of a panel of qualified\n            experts (the Panel for the Security of the Dam) for\n            providing guidance and advice in the implementation of\n            difficult projects. The last lesson is that in projects with\n            large dams and/or underground works under difficult\n            geological conditions, there can be no final design until\n            the project is completed. The project designs should be kept\n            flexible enough to allow new and innovative technologies to\n            be applied."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Morazan Dam Emergency Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Honduras -
