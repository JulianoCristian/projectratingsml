The Bank\n            performance rating was moderately satisfactory and the\n            borrower performance was satisfactory.  The risk to\n            development outcome was rated substantial.  Several lessons\n            were learned. Project preparation was not sufficient, which\n            led to implementation delays in initial years. Establishing\n            a Project Management Team (PMT) at the General Directorate\n            of Civil Emergencies was one of the effectiveness\n            conditions, but it took the Ministry of Interior about one\n            year since project approval to establish the team. Moreover,\n            none of the terms of reference for key studies and\n            consultancy services was developed before project approval.\n            Coordination of multiple agencies, despite the relatively\n            small size of the project was complex with four independent\n            components, each of which was implemented by a different\n            agency. A more effective coordination mechanism should have\n            been carefully thought through at project preparation and\n            managed throughout project implementation.  Early on, the\n            Government and the Bank should have paid more serious\n            attention to the operational phases of various project\n            activities to ensure effective operational arrangements\n            after the project is completed.  Starting small is a less\n            risky approach as major investments will take place only if\n            the required capacity and other necessary arrangements are\n            in place.  Finally, taking a regional approach to disaster\n            risk management was a key lesson of the insurance component.\n            The Albanian government managed to create the framework for\n            reducing its fiscal risk exposure to natural disasters and\n            at the same time secured access to affordable and innovative\n            catastrophe insurance products.  A regional approach to\n            disaster risk management can benefit all participating\n            countries by enabling them to reach better quality outcomes\n            at a much reduced cost per country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Disaster Risk Mitigation and\n            Adaptation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Disaster Risk\n            Mitigation and
