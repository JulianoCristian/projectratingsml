Some lessons learned\n            includes: the Bank is well equipped to provide added value\n            to projects of this nature, ensuring that road safety and\n            environmental management protocols are adequately integrated\n            into project design and implementation. The establishment of\n            unified environmental standards for all contractors involved\n            in project execution is a practice worth replicating in\n            similar projects. The establishment of formal channels for\n            continued feedback from users and civil society provided a\n            vital instrument for guaranteeing successful project\n            implementation, enabling inclusion of citizens'\n            perspectives and knowledge in the actual design of projects,\n            strengthening ownership by local communities, and\n            democratizing the overall process.

The reallocation is necessary to be\n            able to use the funds currently in the\n            'unallocated' category set forth in the loan\n            agreement. This reallocation will not change the percentage\n            of financing. The main component of this project, the\n            upgrading of National Road 19, will receive the full amount\n            of the unallocated funds. The construction works along\n            National Road 19 are progressing according to the work plan\n            set forth at the time of the bidding and no cost overruns\n            have been observed. The total costs of the upgrading works\n            will reach US$175 million and consequently the reallocation\n            will allow to approximate the percentage of financing (the\n            Province of Santa Fe will provide additional resources if\n            necessary as counterpart funds). The upgraded Road 19, with\n            the exception of 2km in the City of Santo Tome will be\n            completed in June 2011, with the remaining works expected to\n            be completed by February, 2012. Closing date of this Project\n            is June 30, 2012."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Province of Santa Fe\n            Road Infrastructure Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/05/14202717/argentina-province-santa-fe-road-infrastructure-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"AR-Santa Fe Road Infrastructure -- P099051","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Post Conflict Reconstruction,Housing & Human Habitats,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Conflict and Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Argentina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20110516234336"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Roads and highways","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Conflict and Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"counterpart, counterpart funds, economic\n            integration, Expenditure, Expenditures, Interest Rate,\n            Interest Rate Caps, international markets, intervention,\n            lanes, LOAN, Loan Agreement, loan proceeds, ROAD, ROAD\n            INFRASTRUCTURE, road safety, road safety action, transport,\n            transport conditions"}},"owner":"Transport (LCSTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"61707"},"13166638":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/11/13166638/argentina-ar-santa-fe-road-infrastructure-p099051-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-08","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/11/13166638/argentina-ar-santa-fe-road-infrastructure-p099051-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-08","new_url":"2010/11/13166638/argentina-ar-santa-fe-road-infrastructure-p099051-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-08","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-11-27T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-11-27T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b0802691fb","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0802691fb","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/LCR/2010/11/27/42055924C09671A0852577E90018E8F9/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/P0990510ISR0Di012720101290918724919.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/LCR/2010/11/27/42055924C09671A0852577E90018E8F9/1_0/Rendered/PDF/P0990510ISR0Di012720101290918724919.pdf","loan_no":"IBRD74290","docdt":"2010-11-27T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2010-11-27T00:00:00Z","volnb":"1","docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
