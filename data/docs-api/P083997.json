Alto Solimoes Basic Services and\n            Sustainable Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Alto Solimoes Basic Services and\n            Sustainable Development Project for Brazil received an\n            unsatisfactory outcomes rating with high risk to development\n            outcome. Both the Banka and Borrower received unsatisfactory\n            ratings for their performances. The project development\n            objective was: (i) to raise incomes, (ii) to increase access\n            to potable water and basic sanitation; and (iii) to improve\n            health outcomes. Activities would center on targeted areas\n            of Alto Solimoes Region. There were five Level 2\n            restructurings approved by Bank Management (Country\n            Director), resulting in cumulative extensions of the closing\n            date totaling almost two years. There were several lessons\n            taken from this project and are as follows: (a) the project\n            design has to be realistic and in tune with institutional\n            capacity and recent experiences. It also has to be flexible\n            and adapt to adjustments in the project description,\n            activities and financial resources. The Result Framework and\n            the performance indicators need to be rationally linked and\n            reviewed continuously during preparation, adapting to\n            adjustments in design, to ensure the likelihood of achieving\n            the intended objectives and defined targets, (b) a long\n            preparation period should be avoided, in particular when\n            there are significant changes in the Borrower\u0092s policies and\n            priorities, as well as shifting economic and social\n            conditions, (c) it is imperative to include in the original\n            design systematic and well tested mechanisms and tools for:\n            (i) selection of beneficiaries, (ii) subproject\n            identification, (iii) construction of technically-sound,\n            financially-viable and community-endorsed participatory\n            business plans, (iv) monitoring and evaluation, (v)\n            provision of relevant, adequate and timely technical\n            assistance, (d) operations considering a multi-sector\n            approach, with different institutions, target groups and set\n            of objectives/indicators, should be extremely carefully\n            designed and proposed only in cases of relatively more\n            experienced borrowers with proven implementing capacity, (e)\n            in environments where competition is likely to be limited a\n            market study should be carried out to identify potential\n            contractor, (f) the Bank should be more proactive in\n            addressing weaknesses in monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            design, encouraging the Government and the implementing\n            agencies to implement an adequate M&E system early in\n            the project life. (g) It is advisable to define a project\n            technical assistance/extension strategy in advance. The\n            project needs to incorporate formal partnership agreements\n            and a component for the development of the capacities of\n            these institutions to attend to Project demands, (h)\n            ensuring high quality engineering designs before\n            implementation should be the normal practice, to be able to\n            identify the correct scope of the works and the\n            corresponding amount of resources needed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Alto Solimoes Basic Services and\n            Sustainable Development

The\n            Alto-Solimoes region is located in the far western part of\n            the State of Amazonas bordering Colombia and Peru. It covers\n            nine municipalities, and is accessible only by air and\n            river, which creates unusual logistical and implementation\n            challenges. The reallocation consists in increasing the\n            amount allocated to categories one (works) and two (goods)\n            and reducing categories three (consultants services), four\n            (training), five (incremental operating costs) and ten\n            (unallocated). The total amount proposed for reallocation is\n            US$6,605,890.  The reasons for the reallocation provided by\n            the borrower are: (a) exchange rate devaluation; (b)\n            prioritization of works over consultants' services; and\n            (c)
