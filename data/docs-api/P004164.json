describes anticipated\n            negative environmental impacts and their mitigations.\n            Terminal construction is expected to cause changes in the\n            topography and the marine ecosystem, as well as cause\n            impacts in air quality, seawater quality, and noise levels.\n            Specifically, dredging works and site preparation will\n            affect the marine environment and the natural topography.\n            Tides, tidal discharge, current velocity, sedimentation, and\n            marine species and quantity reduction of eggs, young fish,\n            plankton, Benthos, and shellfish may result. Sewage\n            discharged during construction and operation may affect\n            seawater quality if disposed without treatment. Methods for\n            reducing potentially harmful impacts include installing\n            filters, scheduling work, installing dust barriers, and\n            washing facilities for vehicles to mitigate air pollution.\n            To prevent seawater pollution, install silt protectors to\n            contain the production of suspended solids during land\n            reclamation and dredging, operate sewage treatment systems,\n            and provide an oil \"fence\" in the event of a\n            spillage accident caused by a tank carrier. To decrease\n            noise levels, construction vehicles will operate at low\n            speed and nighttime work will be lomited during\n            construction.

negative environmental impacts and their\n            proposed mitigations. Expected changes to topography include\n            changes caused by disposing of dredged soil and by\n            accumulating building materials for construction work. The\n            amount of suspended solids because of the outflow of muddy\n            water would only minimally affect the quality of seawater\n            and its ecological balance, but building embankments and\n            erosion control will offset this impact. Because fishery\n            resources may be affected, compensation should be considered\n            for affected populations. Although the risk of gas leakage\n            is reduced because the weight if liquid natural gas (LNG) is\n            lighter and less explosive than LPG, potential accidents can\n            be avoided by using detectors and alarms, providing safety\n            education, and improving skills in accident prevention."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Gas System Expansion Project :\n            environmental assessment report on the construction work of\n            Pyongtaek LNG receiving terminal"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Korea - Gas System Expansion\n            Project : environmental assessment report on the\n            construction work of Pyongtaek LNG receiving terminal"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/12/2224538/korea-gas-system-expansion-project-environmental-assessment-report-construction-work-pyongtaek-lng-receiving-terminal","projn":"KR-Gas System Expansion -- P004164","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Energy and Environment,Water and Industry,Engineering,Roads & Highways,Montreal Protocol","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Korea, Republic of","authors":{"authr":"Korea Electric Corporation"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03041704021944"},"subsc":"Oil and gas","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accident prevention,accidents,Air,Air\n            Pollution,air pressure,Air Quality,air\n            temperature,alarms,atmosphere,average relative\n            humidity,boilers,bottleneck,bridge,building\n            materials,CATION,Charcoal,chemical compounds,chemical\n            industries,clean\n            energy,Climate,CO,coal,cogeneration,construction,construction,construction\n            work,COOLING,CORROSION,crude\n            oil,Diffusion,drainage,dredging,Ecosystem,Electric\n            Power,embankment,energy consumption,energy demand,energy\n            policy,energy sources,energy substitution,energy\n            supply,Engineering,environmental\n            assessment,FREEZING,fuel,furnaces,Gas,hc,HEATING,heavy fuel\n            oil,Humidity,hydrogen,income,iron,Land\n            Use,leakage,lime,liquefaction,LNG,lOADING,methane,Natural\n            Environment,Natural Gas,Natural\n            Resources,navigation,Noise,petroleum,PILE,pipes,piping,POLYETHYLENE,power\n            generation,precipitation,PRESSURE,Prevention of\n            Disasters,primary energy,rain,raw\n            materials,roads,safety,sand,SEAWATER,ships,siberia,Solar\n            Energy,SOx,steel,stone,sulfur,sulfur oxides,suspended\n            particles,Suspended Solids,temperature,Thermal\n            Power,Topography,total energy\n            demand,Traffic,transport,Transportation,urban\n            pollution,Vibration,Waste,water pollution,Wind,Wind\n            direction,Wind velocity,work"},"1":{"cdata!":"accident prevention,accidents,Air,Air\n            Pollution,air pressure,Air Quality,air\n            temperature,alarms,atmosphere,average relative\n            humidity,boilers,bottleneck,bridge,building\n            materials,CATION,Charcoal,chemical compounds,chemical\n            industries,clean\n            energy,Climate,CO,coal,cogeneration,construction,construction,construction\n            work,COOLING,CORROSION,crude\n            oil,Diffusion,drainage,dredging,Ecosystem,Electric\n            Power,embankment,energy consumption,energy demand,energy\n            policy,energy sources,energy substitution,energy\n            supply,Engineering,environmental\n            assessment,FREEZING,fuel,furnaces,Gas,hc,HEATING,heavy fuel\n            oil,Humidity,hydrogen,income,iron,Land\n            Use,leakage,lime,liquefaction,LNG,lOADING,methane,Natural\n            Environment,Natural Gas,Natural\n            Resources,navigation,Noise,petroleum,PILE,pipes,piping,POLYETHYLENE,power\n            generation,precipitation,PRESSURE,Prevention of\n            Disasters,primary energy,rain,raw\n            materials,roads,safety,sand,SEAWATER,ships,siberia,Solar\n            Energy,SOx,steel,stone,sulfur,sulfur oxides,suspended\n            particles,Suspended Solids,temperature,Thermal\n            Power,Topography,total energy\n            demand,Traffic,transport,Transportation,urban\n            pollution,Vibration,Waste,water pollution,Wind,Wind\n            direction,Wind velocity,work"}},"owner":"Energy & Mining Sector Unit (EASEG)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"25771"},"facets":{}}}
