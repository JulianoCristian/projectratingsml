Lessons learned included the following: 1) A\n            high level of ownership and commitment is critical for\n            public sector reform. Public sector projects are different\n            as reform/change is the heart of the project. It is not\n            possible to successfully implement a public sector reform\n            project without complete ownership of and commitment to the\n            program within government.  2) Credible evidence of\n            political commitment to the difficult aspects of the reform\n            should be available at the time of appraisal. In the case of\n            a change in government, continuation of the project (in this\n            case, extension) should be subject to similar indications of\n            commitment. 3) For difficult public sector reform projects,\n            it might be a good idea to keep the project life within the\n            life of the government. In any event, starting\n            implementation such a short time before elections (about a\n            year in this case) is not prudent. 4) It most cases it might\n            be too much to expect sustained commitment to reform over an\n            eleven year period. Although, in the circumstances, the\n            choice of the APL instrument mitigated this risk it might\n            have been more prudent to test commitment with a 2-3 year\n            pilot. 5) The implementing and coordinating agency needs to\n            have suitable authority. 6) Keep the project focused. The\n            scope of the project should be limited to components that\n            are inter-related and within which there is a synergy. 7)\n            Linkages between components of a reform and the sequencing\n            of those reforms need to be recognized at design and\n            implementation stage. 8) Appropriate monitoring and\n            evaluation mechanisms are required to monitor the impact of\n            the reforms. 9) For consultancy-intensive projects the\n            supply side is of critical importance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Public Sector Management

effectiveness, and quality of public services.\n            This project, phase one of a comprehensive reform program\n            consisting of sequenced events to be achieved over an\n            eleven-year period, uses the Adaptable Program Lending (APL)\n            instrument. The project aims to a) re-define the role and\n            functions of the state; b) design appropriate institutions\n            and systems to implement this role; and c) rationalize the\n            existing structure and systems to meet the new design. The\n            project has three different components: The first component\n            reforms subvented agencies to make the public sector\n            cost-effective and to reduce the financial burden on\n            government budget by critically reviewing the mandates of\n            mandated agencies--closing down those without a clear\n            mandate, and restructuring those with a viable mandate. The\n            second component restructures the central\n            government--reviewing mandates and responsibilities,\n            removing duplications and overlaps, developing new roles and\n            missions, and realigning functions in line with the\n            decentralization policy. The third component specifically\n            targets systemic constraints in the public sector: it\n            implements a human resource management system, a performance\n            system, an incentive system, and a management information\n            system as well as introduces private sector input and\n            standards on government operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Public
