Some lessons\n            learned included: in order to provide a timely response to\n            Borrowers' needs, projects contemplating large civil\n            works can be appraised on the basis of conceptual and\n            preliminary engineering designs, but the project's\n            costing, disbursement and implementation schedules need to\n            clearly reflect this. Project design needs to ensure the\n            coordination of civil works interventions so as to minimize\n            their impact on the community. The use of an external\n            management support firm can be positive in transferring\n            knowledge to the local team, but the knowledge transfer can\n            take time and a transition period is needed to ensure the\n            local team is fully operational. Results frameworks need to\n            be designed: (i) candidly to present what a project can\n            actually achieve during its timeframe; and (ii) taking into\n            account Borrowers' capacity for measuring results and\n            the availability of reliable baseline data. The design and\n            implementation of a strong and effective communication plan\n            is a key instrument to address citizen demands regarding\n            impacts from large infrastructure investments. Complex urban\n            development projects can be managed effectively by\n            medium-sized municipalities with a reasonable institutional\n            and operational capacity. An integrated urban water\n            management approach is effective, creates synergies among\n            financing and implementation institutions, and allows local\n            stakeholders to understand project objectives and results.\n            The relevance of the World Bank's assistance for\n            achieving impact and sustainability is high even when it is\n            not the main source of funding."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - First Phase of the Municipal\n            Adaptable Program Loan : Uberaba Agua Viva Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - First

Water Supply\n            System - Living Water Project, aims to promote better living\n            conditions for all residents of the municipality of Uberaba\n            through the promotion of integrated urban sanitation,\n            environmental preservation, and expansion of parks and\n            recreational and cultural opportunities. More specifically,\n            the project has the following objectives: 1) restore\n            degraded areas along the banks of water bodies located\n            within the urban area of Uberaba; 2) eliminate the release\n            of unpleasant odors in the city center; 3) provide\n            theopulation strategies for development of leisure and\n            recreation; 4) increase the supply of water while not\n            overloading the current stock; and 5) reducing the incidence\n            of waterborne diseases and outbreaks of communicable\n            diseases spread by insects and rodents. The pattern that\n            emerges from impact analysis is one of short-term negative\n            impacts during project implementation that are more than\n            offset by long term improvements. The implementation stage\n            will concentrate the most negative impacts but also have\n            some positive impacts. Impacts during project implementation\n            will be augmented because work will be done in heavily\n            trafficked commercial areas. The contracting of employees\n            for the project will generate a number of significant\n            impacts. Large public works project such as this one tend to\n            generate a mass of short-term migrants who, employed with\n            the project or not, bring increases in criminality,\n            prostitution etc. as people mill around the area searching\n            for opportunities. The mass of short-term migrants will also\n            increase demand for public services. The noise/dust/traffic\n            associated with construction will also negatively affect\n            residents in all areas where construction will take place.\n            The central city will suffer negative impacts while\n            interceptors and canals are being installed. Negative\n            effects will also be localized and temporary. A long-term\n            impact of the Agua Viva program will be an improvement in\n            the health conditions of city residents related to\n            water-borne illnesses."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Plano de A\u00e7\u00e3o para o Reassentamento Involunt\u00e1rio"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil -
