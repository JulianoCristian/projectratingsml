Some lessons learned include: The\n            Sustainable Development Action Program (SDAP) consisted of\n            nine development scenarios enabling the Council of Ministers\n            (CoM) to select the best scenario based on tangible\n            indicators. While the shared vision process was successful,\n            using a Multi Donor Trust Fund (MTDF) could have simplified\n            the design and the measure of progress. Many development\n            partners funded the shared vision process and each partner\n            came with its requirement and procedures. The establishment\n            of a strongly coordinated development partners group and the\n            regular interaction of the group with the Niger Basin\n            Authority (NBA) proved to be very effective. In the context\n            of the Niger Basin, the development partner group is part of\n            the organ gram of the NBA. Global Environmental Facility\n            (GEF) Grant funding can play a catalytic role in\n            strengthening a regional organization and leveraging\n            additional funds and preparing the institution to the next\n            level of capacity building. The processes of joint planning,\n            good practice sharing, and implication of all stakeholders\n            proved crucial in abiding by the principles of the Shared\n            Vision. Indeed, the GEF project was catalytic in\n            strengthening the NBA in its role as a regional river basin\n            organization. The Bank should be realistic regarding project\n            implementation planning and difficult supervision of\n            regional projects. There is a need for realism in operations\n            that combine relatively low capacity of the Recipient with\n            multiple players at the regional, national and local levels.\n            The project implemented many broadly scattered activities in\n            nine countries at multiple institutional levels, compounded\n            by the strongly centralized and cumbersome disbursement\n            procedures for grass-root level activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa - Reversing Land and Water\n            Degradation Trends in the Niger River Basin

However, the\n            next ordinary Council of Ministers will take place in\n            October 2010 and hence the endorsement of the SAP cannot\n            take place before October 2010."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Africa -

The global environmental objective of the\n            Reversing Land and Water Degradation Trends in the Niger\n            River Basin Project is to reduce and prevent transboundary\n            water-related environmental degradation; prevent land\n            degradation; and protect globally significant biodiversity,\n            through sustainable, informed, and cooperative integrated\n            management of the Basin, while ensuring greater public\n            involvement in the Basin's decision-making process. The\n            Project development objective is to provide the nine\n            riparians an opportunity to define a transboundary framework\n            for the sustainable development of the Niger River Basin,\n            through strengthened capacity and better understanding of\n            the Basin's land and water resources. The Bank\n            implemented components aim to strengthen NBA's regional\n            management capacity and improve data management capacity.\n            There are six project components.  Component 1, Institution\n            Building, augments existing regional and national\n            institutional capacity to manage and implement concurrent\n            regional projects. Component 2, Capacity Building and Public\n            Awareness, promotes activities designed to raise\n            environmental awareness in target communities, facilitate\n            consultations, and build capacity on issues relating to\n            environmental management at the local, national and regional\n            levels. The component includes a public education and\n            awareness program and focused training. Component 3, Data\n            and Knowledge Management, complements ongoing work on water\n            and environment data collection by evaluating the status of\n            the Basin's hydrologic, environmental, and\n            socioeconomic data, and identifying the institutional\n            modalities needed for data collection, sharing and\n            dissemination for decision-makers. The component includes\n            developing an Environmental Information System framework.\n            Component 4, Regional Forum, facilitates the exchange of\n            lessons and good practices from other regional projects in\n            Sub-Saharan Africa, expands on \"IW:Learn\", and\n            strengthens the relationship with existing Pan-African and\n            international networks of Basin organizations, Component 5,\n            Demonstration Pilots and Micro-grant Program, aims to\n            support two parallel efforts in all nine Basin countries.\n            The first assists communities in tackling environmental\n            problems by implementing nine priority demonstration pilots\n            of good practices in managing land and water resources. In\n            parallel to the demonstration pilots, a series of\n            community-based, micro-grant-supported interventions will be\n            implemented, taking advantage of lessons emerging from the\n            pilots' demonstrations activities.  Component 6,\n            finalizes the preliminary Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis\n            (TDA) conducted during Project preparation in the main stem\n            countries (Benin, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria) b y\n            extending the diagnostic analysis process to the remaining\n            four riparian countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad and\n            Cote d'Ivoire). Through and on the basis of this\n            extended priority identification process, countries will\n            prepare a Strategic Action Program (SAP), focusing on land\n            and water issues and complementing the Shared Vision's\n            multi-sectoral SDAP."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger Basin Authority - Reversing the Land\n            and Water Degradation Trends in the River

This\n            report examines possible negative environmental impacts and\n            proposes measures to offset them. To reduce soil erosion,\n            encourage rapid regeneration of vegetation and avoid\n            exploitative methods that deteriorate the soil. Limit the\n            use of chemical fertilizers while encouraging the use of\n            organic fertilizers. Only use pesticides in accordance with\n            national and international standards, and continuously\n            monitor that use. Control flooding, soil compaction, and\n            salinization caused by temporary dams (weirs) construction.\n            Use drainage systems and diversify land use. Limit livestock\n            grazing. Inform tourists about good practices. To avoid\n            water contamination, monitor its exploitation and regulate\n            its use, and adopt water and soil conservation measures.\n            Restore the vegetal cover as soon as possible after clearing\n            for construction, avoid sloping, regulate grazing, renew\n            forage production, and avoid planting species whose growth\n            will be difficult to contain. Monitor biodiversity and\n            consider impacts on animal habitats--such as toxic pesticide\n            use, avoid introducing predators that might thin the native\n            animal population. Teach tourists good practices in\n            biodiversity conservation as well as inform them of legal\n            requirements. Other mitigations include limiting access to\n            protected areas, resettling displaced populations in\n            appropriate areas where they will be financially compensated\n            and be given access to health services, education, and\n            adequate infrastructure; and have access to conflict\n            resolution mechanisms in land use disputes. To control\n            quality and reduce the risk of toxicity from pesticides on\n            agricultural products, avoid aerial spraying and use\n            approved products."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afrique - Projet d ' Inversion des\n            Tendances a la Degradation des Terres et des Eaux du Bassin\n            du Fleuve Niger : Cadre de gestion environnementale et sociale"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afrique \u2013 Projet d\u2019inversion des\n            tendances \u00e0 la d\u00e9gradation des terres et des eaux du bassin\n            du fleuve Niger : \u00e9valuation environnementale : Afrique\u00a0-\n            Projet d\u2019inversion des tendances \u00e0 la d\u00e9gradation des terres\n            et des eaux du bassin du fleuve Niger\u00a0: Cadre de gestion\n            environnementale et sociale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/03/3039258/africa-reversing-land-water-degradation-trends-niger-river-basin-project-environmental-assessment-afrique-projet-d-inversion-des-tendances-la-degradation-des-terres-des-eaux-du-bassin-du-fleuve-niger-cadre-de-gestion-environnementale-sociale","projn":"3A-Reversing Land And Water Degradation\n            Trends In The Niger River -- P070256","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Benin,Burkina Faso,Cameroon,Chad,Cote d'Ivoire,Guinea,Mali,Niger,Nigeria","authors":{"authr":"Boukar Attari;
