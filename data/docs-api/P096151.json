Some lessons\n            learned included: learning and sustainability of pilot\n            activities are limited when there is an absence of clear\n            design, an explicit mechanism for evaluating, and a\n            sufficient implementation time frame. Setting up a\n            monitoring and evaluation system takes more time than\n            governments and task team leaders (TTLs) often recognize and\n            provide. A prior unsuccessful project can result in\n            learning, but it depends upon an accurate understanding of\n            performance issues. Even with a state-focused project, the\n            involvement of the federal ministry of education is critical\n            given its central role in policy. Improving inputs into\n            learning (facilities, textbooks, etc.) needs to be\n            accompanied by defining and addressing quality requirements\n            in terms of minimum
