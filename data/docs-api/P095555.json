Some\n            lessons learned included: the impact of political\n            transitions on project implementation can be significant, in\n            particular when the new administration disagrees with\n            significant aspects of project objectives and design. The\n            Bank teams must be alert to changes in administration\n            priorities and consider a restructuring of the project early\n            on to make the necessary adjustments if common ground can be\n            found on sound technical principles. This is particularly\n            true in the case of Adaptable Program Loans (APLs) or\n            projects prepared by one administration but implemented by\n            another. In addition, rushing through initial implementation\n            shortly before an administration change, despite allowing\n            for more expedite implementation, poses risks especially\n            when it can be expected that the incoming administration\n            might have different priorities from the one preparing the\n            project. Finally, the Bank should not shy away from\n            sustaining high-level, frank discussions with incoming\n            administrations on the scope and technical principles of\n            on-going or new projects, and consider a mutually agreed\n            cancellation as an acceptable option if no agreement can be\n            found. In the case of a deteriorating project\n            implementation, it is important for the Bank team not to\n            alienate the Borrower's goodwill towards the project.\n            Tradeoffs must be made between the need to maintain or\n            improve the quality of project implementation, and the need\n            to maintain working relationships with the client so as to\n            reduce the risk of having to close a project without the\n            support and engagement of the client."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Second Rural and Small Towns Water\n            Supply and

inhabitants, and provides\n            technical assistance to delegate these services and improve\n            sustainability of solid waste investments in urban and rural\n            areas. Given the presence of Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian\n            peoples in the project area, an Indigenous Peoples Plan (the\n            Plan) is triggered. The main objectives of the Plan will be\n            (a) to coordinate the supply and demand of water and\n            sanitation investment in Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian\n            communities, (b) to coordinate efforts of the Sub Secretary\n            of Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste (SAPSyRS), the health\n            ministry (including the Indigenous Health Dept), and the\n            education ministry (including the National Directorate of\n            Intercultural Bilingual Education) to standardize training\n            contents and strategies to train water and sanitation users\n            and water boards in Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian\n            communities, in order to improve the health conditions and\n            achieve sustainability of the water systems by optimizing\n            their financial administration, (c) to coordinate the\n            promotion and dissemination of information on the project\n            with Consejo Nacional de Nacionalidades y Pueblos Indigenas\n            del Ecuador (CODENPE), the Coordinadora de Desarrollo Afro\n            Ecuatoriano (CODAE) and \"alternative municipalities and\n            'mancomunidades'\" to ensure the information\n            reaches the poor and isolated. The Plan also discusses a\n            promotion campaign through the media in Spanish but with an\n            intercultural focus, and in indigenous languages as needed;\n            training of indigenous cabildos and water boards in\n            financial, administrative, technical, and social management\n            of water and sanitation systems with an intercultural focus;\n            regional workshops with alternative municipalities and\n            juntas parroquiales at the national level; and mid-term and\n            ex-post evaluations of sewerage and solid waste projects\n

By 2005, PRAGUAS had improved water supply and\n            sanitation (WSS) services for over 250,000 people. The town\n            component of the project supports municipalities which are\n            willing to make their utilities more autonomous and to raise\n            tariffs to obtain quick service improvements and choose\n            their own management models. PRAGUAS has become the\n            government's primary vehicle for addressing challenges\n            in the water supply and sanitation sector. The objective of\n            PRAGUAS is to increase the coverage and effective use of\n            sustainable WSS services.
