The sustainability of community-based\n            initiatives depends crucially on an enabling institutional\n            environment, which requires government commitment, and on\n            accountability of leaders to their community to avoid\n            'supply-driven demand-driven' development.\n            Programs designed to change behavior need to be grounded in\n            a deep understanding of context; they need to be willing to\n            engage in a study of what motivates people.

Increased focus\n            on generating community feedback in the Nigeria Fadama\n            project, funded by the World Bank, is helping to improve\n            rural livelihoods by deepening the quality and quantity of\n            communication between development practitioners,\n            governments, and community members. The farmers have\n            struggled in the face of grinding poverty and livelihoods\n            have been undercut by low agricultural yields. The project\n            has developed a vibrant network of inclusive community\n            networks. It has also launched a promising mobile phone and\n            SMS-based system that will allow beneficiaries to provide\n            feedback on a variety of indicators from the performance of\n            project staff to suggestions on how to improve the timing of\n            funds disbursement.

Fadama project\n            has built strong networks of community associations and user\n            groups and piloting of an SMS network should be seen as a\n            starting point for a system of feedback mechanisms that can\n            provide both more quantitative and more qualitative\n            information on project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -

Lessons\n            learned include: empowering community organizations with\n            resources and enhancing their capacity to manage these\n            directly through community driven development (CDD) approach\n            enhances efficiency and sustainability of targeted\n            poverty-reduction projects. Until the capacity of the poor\n            farmers has been sufficiently developed to improve their\n            limitations and creditworthiness for traditional\n            microfinance institutions, it is inevitable that they should\n            be assisted with grants in order to participate in\n            Fadama-type livelihood activities.

It is the central paradigm shift\n            around which the entire Fadama system revolves. Keep an eye\n            on sustainability of project supported interventions.\n            Selection and management of subprojects by communities and\n            their cost sharing in the matching grant facilitate\n            sustainability. In order to lay a sound basis for\n            sustainability, operations and maintenance of assets should\n            be undertaken by communities and local governments, through\n
