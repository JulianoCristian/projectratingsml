Lessons\n            learned includes: 1) bearing in mind the constraints on the\n            institutional capacity of Government of Tamil Nadu (GTN) as\n            well as the resources of the Bank, the project's scope\n            should have been less ambitious and much simpler. Although\n            TNUDP's overall performance was better than those of\n            other Bank-financed integrated urban development projects in\n            India, the Project Management Group and the Bank could not\n            address the problems of non-performing components such as\n            Transport and Traffic Management Program Component of TNUDP\n            (TRAMP) and Slum Improvement Program Component of TNUDP\n            (SIP) in a timely manner; 2) financial intermediaries such\n            as Municipal Urban Development Fund of TNUDP (MUDF) and\n            TNUDF can contribute to the strengthening of municipalities\n            by imposing financial discipline on them as a condition of\n            loan provision, and by helping them develop municipal\n            projects. However, the financial intermediaries alone cannot\n            address the fundamental problems of municipalities'\n            weak institutional capacities and weak financial situations.\n            Most of the municipalities do not have adequate financial,\n            managerial, administrative, and technical institutional\n            capacities, which should be strengthened by technical\n            assistance (TA) and the training program; 3) the project was\n            most successful in the areas of policy reform and good\n            practice where Government support for the objectives was\n            strongest; and 4) project management would have been\n            improved substantially if greater decision making authority\n            for resource allocation had been delegated to the project\n            management group (PMG). Authority of this kind would have\n            provided PMG with the means and incentives to take prompt\n            and effective action to correct any emerging inadequacies in implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
