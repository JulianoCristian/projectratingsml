The\n            project was terminated at the government's request\n            after nearly two years of operation from the date of loan\n            effectiveness. Disbursements were to concentrate on studies\n            aimed at improving the sector regulatory framework. Project\n            implementation had encountered insurmountable difficulties,\n            deriving basically from: 1) the inability of the Ministry of\n            Environment, Natural Resources an Fisheries (SEMARNAP) to\n            deliver the planned output, due to the budgetary\n            restrictions discussed in the report; and 2) the fact that\n            the Ministry of Finance rejected the arrangments set down in\n            the Staff Appraisal Report for the Targeted Investment Fund\n            and for the AquaMexico fund--this last one on the grounds\n            that their execution would have resulted in authorizing the\n            new parastatals, which was against the Government of\n            Mexico's policy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

While focusing on seven\n            states, the project benefits aquaculture producers, traders,\n            and processors throughout Mexico. It has two components: (1)\n            The first helps complete and implements the\n            government's regulatory framework, and provides key\n            public goods to stimulate productive sector (private and\n            social) investment. Its four subcomponents are: (i)\n            regulatory framework, (ii) environmental and coastal\n            resources management, (iii) public goods and services, and\n            (iv) institutional strengthening and project coordination.\n            (2) The second component, incorporating the Social Strategy\n            and Indigenous Peoples Development Plan, supports productive\n            investments and training for residents of\n            \"ejidos,\" cooperatives, communal land groups, and\n            other economically disadvantaged producers, and develops an\n            appropriate institutional framework that creates a more\n            level playing field for social sector participation in\n            aquaculture. This component includes two subcomponents: (i)\n            social aquaculture production, and (ii) institutional\n            development. The project will support investments in\n            aquaculture parks and hatcheries, create limited liability\n            corporations to manage them, and train management
