Some\n            lessons learned included: project design should confine\n            itself to interventions that can be controlled and\n            implemented by project authorities. Political decisions like\n            government financing of the health sector and transfer and\n            postings of staff should either be avoided or have stringent\n            monitoring mechanisms in place tied to disbursements in\n            order to be effective. In a project that has a large volume\n            of procurement of goods and equipment, this means that all\n            drawings, technical specifications, procurement plans and,\n            if necessary, a Procurement Agent with adequate experience,\n            are ready and in place before effectiveness. In the absence\n            of this, initial delays are inevitable. Developing systems\n            that provide quality care to the poorest involves a\n            multi-dimensional approach. There needs to be investment in\n            strategic planning, human resources, partnerships with all\n            available resources in the health sector, technical capacity\n            and other socio-economic and cultural factors that impact\n            demand for services. The approach taken during the\n            preparation of the follow-on operation is encouraging in\n            that it has brought all donor partners to the table, to have\n            a coordinated response to the needs of the states of UP and\n            UK. In addition, due to increased funding by National Rural\n            Health Mission (NRHM) to Indian states, new projects need to\n            take a holistic approach instead of a piecemeal one, looking\n            at the entire set of interventions focused on improving\n            health indicators in the state and funded by multiple\n            sources, to attain the biggest benefits. On the\n            institutional side, the Project Management Units (PMUs)\n            created for Bank projects get dissolved at the end of the\n            projects; thus rendering the expertise built through the\n            year's unusable post-closure. A long-term involvement\n            through appropriate lending instruments is imperative to\n            ensure stability and sustainability of institutions and\n            capacities built during the project period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand Health\n            Systems Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Uttar Pradesh and\n

The two main components call for: 1)\n            developing a strategic management capacity, through\n            formulation, and review of health systems performance, and\n            the establishment of a drug policy, public-private\n            partnerships, and manpower activities, as well as pursuing\n            policy reform analysis, and research in the health sector.\n            In addition, accurate health management information systems\n            will be developed, and, managerial appraisal systems\n            implemented to improve actions concerning individual\n            performance, in addition to conducting management training\n            to enable critical project interventions in changing\n            management practices. The project management unit capacity\n            will be strengthened to coordinate and implement project\n            issues; and, 2) improving the quality of clinical practice\n            in public health services, and of access to health services.\n            Quality assurance systems will be introduced in an effort to\n            improve skills, and monitoring practices will ensure\n            adoption of best clinical practices through systematic\n            review of medical, and technical records. Programs and\n            services will focus on disease prevention, and health needs.\n            Both components include the financing of civil works,\n            equipment, and medical supplies, as well as training, and\n            consulting work as needed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Uttar Pradesh Health Systems\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Uttar Pradesh Health\n            Systems Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/03/437857/india-uttar-pradesh-health-systems-development-project","projn":"IN-Uttar Pradesh Health Systems Development\n            Project -- P050657","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_0004110530182"},"subsc":"Health,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"basic health care,basic health\n            services,Blindness,burden of disease,cancer,cardiovascular\n            diseases,Child Development,communicable diseases,Community\n            Health,Cost effectiveness,deaths,Development\n            Projects,disease control,districts,doctors,Economic\n            Analysis,epidemiological\n            transition,equipment,equity,expenditures,externalities,Family\n            Planning,financial management,health care,health care\n            services,Health Centers,health conditions,Health\n            Education,health expenditure,health expenditures,health\n            facilities,health financing,health indicators,Health\n            insurance,health interventions,health needs,health\n            planning,health programs,Health Sector,health\n            services,health system,Health Systems,hospital\n            admissions,hospital equipment,hospital\n            waste,Hospitalization,Hospitals,households,human resource\n            management,illiteracy,in access,incidence analysis,infant\n            mortality,informal\n            sector,innovation,integration,international\n            standards,Intervention,laundry,Leprosy,line\n            managers,Malaria,malnutrition,managers,medical\n            services,mortality,needs\n            assessment,NGOs,nurses,Nutrition,occupancy,occupancy\n            rates,partnership,patient satisfaction,patients,poverty\n            alleviation,preventive health services,private sector,public\n            health,public hospitals,public sector,public\n            services,quality of life,rehabilitation,rural areas,service\n            delivery,therapeutics,urban areas,voluntary sector,waste"},"1":{"cdata!":"basic health care,basic health\n            services,Blindness,burden of disease,cancer,cardiovascular\n            diseases,Child Development,communicable diseases,Community\n            Health,Cost effectiveness,deaths,Development\n            Projects,disease control,districts,doctors,Economic\n            Analysis,epidemiological\n            transition,equipment,equity,expenditures,externalities,Family\n            Planning,financial management,health care,health care\n            services,Health Centers,health conditions,Health\n            Education,health expenditure,health expenditures,health\n            facilities,health financing,health indicators,Health\n            insurance,health interventions,health needs,health\n            planning,health programs,Health Sector,health\n            services,health system,Health Systems,hospital\n            admissions,hospital equipment,hospital\n            waste,Hospitalization,Hospitals,households,human resource\n            management,illiteracy,in access,incidence analysis,infant\n            mortality,informal\n            sector,innovation,integration,international\n            standards,Intervention,laundry,Leprosy,line\n            managers,Malaria,malnutrition,managers,medical\n            services,mortality,needs\n            assessment,NGOs,nurses,Nutrition,occupancy,occupancy\n            rates,partnership,patient satisfaction,patients,poverty\n            alleviation,preventive health services,private sector,public\n            health,public hospitals,public sector,public\n            services,quality of life,rehabilitation,rural areas,service\n            delivery,therapeutics,urban areas,voluntary sector,waste"}},"owner":"S.A.
