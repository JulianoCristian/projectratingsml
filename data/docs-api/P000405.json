The project had three main objectives:\n            (a) in the medium to long run, to promote the participation\n            of the poorest population groups in the process of\n            development; (b) in the short to medium run, to protect\n            underprivileged and vulnerable segments of the population;\n            and (c) to promote the institutionalization of these\n            concerns within the day-to-day responsibilities of existing\n            agencies. Since most of the project's objectives were\n            not achieved, the project was canceled, three and a half\n            years prior to the planned closing date. However, some\n            favorable results were recorded by implementing agencies.\n            Since few activities were implemented, the prospect of\n            project sustainability is limited. The Bank provided\n            abundant resources towards project preparation but project\n            appraisal and supervision were deficient. Project\n            implementation suffered from inadequate government initial\n            commitment and a lack of institutional motivation. The\n            outcome of the project is unsatisfactory as it did not\n            achieve most of its major objectives. Lessons learned\n            included: (a) The Bank should realistically assess the\n            Borrower's political will to address poverty and design\n            poverty projects accordingly; (b) The Bank should be mindful\n            of its critics, but not allow them to unduly influence the\n            shape of the projects it supports; (c) Applying a complex\n            theoretical framework to a single operation is an\n            unrealistic approach for project design. In their eagerness\n            to protect the vulnerable groups in the context of\n            adjustment, the Bank and the government designed an overly\n            ambitious multi-sectoral project, that was difficult to\n            appraise and to implement and too costly to supervise; (d)\n            The Bank should make better use of existing information and\n            carry out complementary studies during preparation; (e) The\n            Bank should appraise project components at appraisal, and\n            not after effectiveness; (f) Performance and impact\n            indicators should be defined by both the Bank and the\n            Borrower during preparation (or at least during appraisal)\n            and should influence project design; (g) The Bank should\n            realistically assess donors' interest in projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Social Dimensions of Adjustment\n            (SDA) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon -
