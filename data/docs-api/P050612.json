Lessons learned from the project: The\n            decentralization of school management brings, among other\n            impacts, an efficient use of funds and fosters innovation at\n            the school level. Role of parental involvement in expanding\n            coverage and improving the quality of education. Crucial\n            role of government commitment in the achievement and\n            sustainability of sector goals. Good collaboration and\n            communication between the Bank and the Borrower is key to\n            overcoming difficulties of any nature. Importance of seeking\n            partnerships to develop and implement policies and\n            strategies. Difficulty in achieving expansion of access in\n            remote areas and improvements in efficiency for the\n            education system.

preschool, and basic education systems, especially\n            in rural and marginal urban areas. There are four project\n            components. 1) Expansion of access to preschool and basic\n            education will include construction of new classrooms and\n            payment of teachers on a declining basis; develop an\n            innovative initial education program with parent\n            participation; and establish accelerated education\n            modalities to meet the needs of over-age children in rural\n            and marginal urban areas and expand alternative (multigrade)\n            classrooms. 2) Quality improvements will support the\n            revision of curriculum for initial and special education,\n            basic education for adults, and accelerated programs to\n            address the special needs of over-age students; review,\n            design, and provide educational materials for teachers and\n            students for all levels and modalities; strengthen teacher\n            training programs; improve health and nutrition school\n            programs; and provide infrastructure and furniture to\n            schools. 3) Institutional strengthening and modernization\n            will establish a financial planning and monitoring system;\n            developing a sustainable system for on-going school-based\n            management initiatives; and further develop communication\n            strategies to increase public awareness of the basic\n            education reform. 4) Project administration will finance\n            operation costs, equipment, and office supplies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - Education
