Second AIDS and STD Control Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was highly likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that the\n            strategic focus of the activities in the project served as a\n            catalyst for change, including attracting additional\n            investment, promoting change, and protecting program\n            investments from political influence, particularly at the\n            municipal level. Even though the project collected\n            significant amounts of data on HIV/AIDS and Sexually\n            Transmitted Deseases (STDs), it was not possible to assess\n            trends over time since the use of differing methodologies\n            resulted in inconsistencies that could not be interpreted.\n            An adequate monitoring and evaluation system was not\n            established. If AIDS II had financed administrative costs on\n            a declining basis, the Ministry of Health (MOH) would have\n            had fewer incentives to rely on external consultants. The\n            project significantly underestimated the administrative\n            demands incurred by the evaluation of more than 2,000\n            projects executed by civil society. Decentralization of\n            management responsibilities to states and municipalities\n            implies a change in roles for all players. The current\n            system allows states and municipalities to make better use\n            of resources at the local level, by increasing synergy with\n            other programs and reducing duplication of efforts. The\n            number of hospitalizations per AIDS patient declined from\n            1.6 in 1996, before ART was introduced, to 0.3 in 2001, for\n            an estimated 358,000 hospitalizations prevented during\n            1997-2001. Providing ART free of charge is not enough to\n            make everyone come forward for treatment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Second AIDS and STD Control

In\n            1993, the World Bank approved 160 million dollars for the\n            AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) Control Project\n            in Brazil. The program focused on prevention efforts, but\n            also covered treatment and testing. Aided by another 165\n            million dollars World Bank loan in 1998, the Control\n            Project, in its second phase, is helping Brazil's\n            ministry of health reduce the spread of human\n            immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS while making it\n            possible for Brazilians with AIDS to live longer, healthier\n            lives. The program has contributed to a 38 percent drop in\n            the number of AIDS-related deaths since 1993. While\n            supporting 145 specialized AIDS care units, 66\n            hospital-based care units, and 50 home-care teams, the focus\n            of the Second AIDS and STD Project remains prevention. It\n            has helped set up a nationwide network of 141 AIDS testing\n            and counseling centers.
