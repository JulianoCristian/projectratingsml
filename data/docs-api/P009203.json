Several lessons were learned. With\n            hindsight, the Yugoslav SAL was overly ambitious and\n            unnecessarily complex. The issues on which attention was\n            focused covered not only the principal macroeconomic areas\n            but also a number of sectoral problems which might have been\n            more effectively dealt with separately. It included a number\n            of conditions which had limited operational content while,\n            in several other instances, the Bank had not been adequately\n            prepared in formulating the provisions and difficulties were\n            encountered in implementation. Nevertheless, the question\n            may be raised whether, even if the quality of the product\n            delivered by the Bank had been improved, would it have been\n            any more effective in achieving the desired results.\n            Moreover, significant institutional changes supported by the\n            SAL have begun to take root, albeit at a slower pace than\n            expected. A key element is the growing acceptance of a\n            project evaluation methodology focusing on economic rates of\n            return. Important advances had also been made in the area of\n            price liberalization but changes continue to occur. Other\n            lessons relate to the possible inclusion of sectoral\n            conditions in a SAL."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Structural Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia -
