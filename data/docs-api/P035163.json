Project\n            sustainability is rated likely. The overall World Bank\n            performance was satisfactory: Despite the shortfall in\n            supervision resources, the Bank team provided significant\n            support to the Borrower. Overall Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory, also: The Government provided provided\n            financial and implementation support to ensure effective\n            project implementation. Some of the lessons learned include\n            the following: The project was well-designed, but key\n            milestone surveys were conducted at a time when few loans\n            were taken and the process was not fully tested.\n            Well-defined operational procedures are essential for pilot\n            projects to generate experiences such that performance\n            measures are meaningful at completion. However well-prepared\n            they are, projects whose main purpose is to change\n            people's behavior through new experiences will by\n            definition be slow to begin, and moreover, slow to disburse.\n            Homeowners Associations (HOA) are able to renovate common\n            property if provided with institutional support, technical\n            support, and financial incentives. Proper legal and\n            regulatory framework is mandatory for facilitating formation\n            of HOAs and energy efficiency investments. Significant\n            institutional support and financial incentives are needed to\n            reduce the transaction costs associated with addressing\n            barriers to the formation of HOAs and to private initiative\n            in maintaining residential buildings."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lithuania - Energy Efficiency/Housing Pilot
