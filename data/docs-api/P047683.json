A\n            number of external factors had considerable impact on this\n            project. Political instability that led to the resignation\n            of four governments within the time-frame of the\n            implementation had a substantial detrimental impact on the\n            implementation of the highly politicized enterprise reform\n            program. The key lessons drawn from the project: 1)\n            State-owned enterprise reform is extremely difficult to\n            achieve even in the best of circumstances and requires years\n            of dedicated effort and a highly committed government. 2)\n            Projects need to be designed for the desired output, not\n            just to provide a core input with the \"hope\" that\n            this will lead to the output. 3) Twinning can be an\n            effective methodology for the transfer of technical skills,\n            especially when the recipient institution has a clear idea\n            and strong interest in what they want out of the\n            arrangements. 4) Any project activities that are intended to\n            be \"pilots\" should really be set up as such, with\n            provision for a joint WBG-client review and dissemination of\n            the \"pilot experience\" built into the project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Banking, Enterprise and Legal\n            Technical Assistance Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia - Banking, Enterprise\n            and Legal Technical Assistance Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/06/1934934/mongolia-banking-enterprise-legal-technical-assistance-credit-project","projn":"MN-Bank,Ent,Leg,Ta(Belt -- P047683","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,National Governance,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,General Technology","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Mongolia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02070304084468"},"subsc":"Banking,Law and justice,Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"audits,Bank Performance,Bank\n            supervision,banking sector,banking\n            system,bankruptcy,BTO,central bank,commercial\n            banks,debt,debt restructuring,deposits,dividends,effective\n            use,enterprise reform,enterprise restructuring,Exchange\n            Rate,execution,financial institutions,financial\n            management,financial performance,financial sector,financial\n            services,financial viability,FISCAL,fiscal burden,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign investors,government intervention,government\n            officials,government's development priorities,human\n            capital,income,inflation,insolvency,Insolvency\n            procedures,insolvent,institutional capacity,Institutional\n            Development,laws,lawyer,legal framework,Legal\n            Reform,legislation,liquidation,market prices,Ministry of\n            Finance,net profit,net sales,new technology,Political\n            instability,poverty alleviation,privatization,public\n            enterprises,public sector,representatives,State\n            Property,structural adjustment,Technical\n            Assistance,trading,trading system,transition\n            economies,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"audits,Bank Performance,Bank\n            supervision,banking sector,banking\n            system,bankruptcy,BTO,central bank,commercial\n            banks,debt,debt restructuring,deposits,dividends,effective\n            use,enterprise reform,enterprise restructuring,Exchange\n            Rate,execution,financial institutions,financial\n            management,financial performance,financial sector,financial\n            services,financial viability,FISCAL,fiscal burden,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign investors,government intervention,government\n            officials,government's development priorities,human\n            capital,income,inflation,insolvency,Insolvency\n            procedures,insolvent,institutional capacity,Institutional\n            Development,laws,lawyer,legal framework,Legal\n            Reform,legislation,liquidation,market prices,Ministry of\n            Finance,net profit,net sales,new technology,Political\n            instability,poverty alleviation,privatization,public\n            enterprises,public sector,representatives,State\n            Property,structural adjustment,Technical\n            Assistance,trading,trading system,transition\n            economies,working capital"}},"owner":"Financial & Private Sector Dept.

The longer-term objective\n            is to promote institutional and skills development to\n            sustain the reforms implemented under the parallel project,\n            the Banking and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (BESAC).\n            BELTAC's components are: (1) commercial bank\n            institutional development, a twinning arrangement of the T\n            & D Bank with a reputable foreign bank, with special\n            attention given to advisory assistance and training for debt\n            workout capacity building, and advisors to help assess the\n            banking institution viability; (2) public enterprise\n            financial restructuring aided by four short-term advisors\n            financed to help carry out financial viability assessments\n            for the two largest public enterprise defaulters; and (3) a\n            legal reform program based on a pipeline of subprojects\n            covering (a) the execution of judgments, specifically,\n            strengthening the Bailiff's office; (b) the\n            establishment of a collateral registry for movable property\n            to facilitate collateralized lending; and (c) a public\n            information campaign focusing on enterprise restructuring\n            and liquidation, and training of legal professionals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Banking,
