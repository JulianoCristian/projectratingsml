The\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory, while that of the\n            borrower was unsatisfactory.  Exterior factors, namely civil\n            conflict and political upheaval, impeded the projects\n            implementation and it, to a large degree, substituted for an\n            absent Ministry of Education.  Several lessons were learned\n            for future projects in countries with fragile states: A) NGO\n            Partnership program. An important innovation for the project\n            and a key factor in the classroom construction program was\n            the incorporation of a larger number of development actors\n            in the implementation of the project. B) Risk Assessment.\n            The undertaking of a serious, detailed risk assessment by\n            the country team would have helped to steer the project in a\n            more sustainable path and/ or to find other strategies to\n            support a failing education sector. C) Preserving\n            Investments in Institutional Capacity. A potential solution\n            to the loss of hands-on experience and formal capacity\n            training would be to build in a transition strategy for the\n            PCU itself at project inception to evolve the organization\n            into an NGO or Foundation at the end of the project. D)\n            Sustainability Plan. In a post-conflict environment\n            alternative arrangements need to be considered for any\n            investments requiring recurrent cost financing.  E) Stronger\n            Incentives Structure. A monetary incentive system lacks\n            basic non-monetary incentives to motivate its public\n            servants (e.g. certificate or recognition). F)\n            Restructuring of Project. In retrospect, the project should\n            have been restructured to more clearly delineate the revised scope."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea-Bissau - Basic Education Support
