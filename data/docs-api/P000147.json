Bank-Borrower\n            relationships were excellent. They cooperated well at the\n            crucial times when the project required restructuring, and\n            later when need arose to extend the life of the project. The\n            project got off to a slow start, due to its relatively\n            complex structure aggravated by a run of dry years, staffing\n            delays and the high level of loans in arrears by the\n            National Development Bank (NDB) clients, which severely\n            reduced the utilization of credit funds made available by\n            the project. As soon as it was launched, the project also\n            became a target of environmental lobbyists who viewed it as\n            environmental unfriendly. A lot of effort had to be put in\n            by both the Bank and Government to defray these criticisms.\n            The project demonstrated the need for careful analysis of\n            all relevant data, including rainfall data, and of\n            input/output parameters, in areas such as ranch development\n            and land use planning. It further demonstrated the need, for\n            smaller and more manageable projects and for the adoption of\n            a process approach, with a built-in mechanism for regular\n            reviews, to which project implementation can respond quickly\n            and flexibly, adjusting project inputs according to need.\n            Finally, the project re-enforced the need for thorough\n            analysis, at appraisal, of the operations and capacities of\n            key institutions which will be involved in project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Botswana -
