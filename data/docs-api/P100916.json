Some lessons\n            learned included: micro-financial institutions may be small\n            but they have the advantage of proximity to the clients and\n            deep outreach. Such institutions invariably operate\n            unsupervised and outside the framework of the banking\n            regulation, and given the limited size of their equity and\n            managerial capacity, face constraints to growth. An\n            important action would be to put in place an enabling\n            regulatory framework and supervision system, assess the\n            viability of such institutions, explore the possibility of\n            consolidating these into larger and stronger institutions\n            which could have a wider operational jurisdiction and offer\n            a wider range of financial services. Studies relating to\n            strategy for penetration of rural markets and training for\n            staff orientation to better understand the risks related to\n            agricultural lending and approaching small and medium rural\n            enterprises are an important mechanism to provide\n            opportunities for private banks to explore provision of\n            rural financial services. An ambitious technical assistance\n            and capacity building program, such as the one implemented\n            under the project, should be supplemented with continuous\n            support and hand-holding from the Bank project team to be\n            successful. An approach that links line of credit with\n            compliance with accreditation criteria has huge potential to\n            effect institutional change. The project not only reduced\n            poverty through project sub-loans but also resulted in\n            significant institutional improvement in the participating\n            banks through continuous and rigorous monitoring of their\n            performance against key performance standards and adjusting\n            the size of their lines of credit in response to their\n            operational performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Third Rural Finance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Third Rural Finance

Vietnam will be to increase economic benefits to\n            rural private enterprises and households by increasing their\n            access to finance. The expected outcomes will include: (i)\n            improved access to financial services for rural\n            entrepreneurs; (ii) increased capital investment made by the\n            rural entrepreneurs as well as increased employment; (iii)\n            increased lending, particularly term lending to the rural\n            private sector for capital investment by all participating\n            financial institutions (PFIs) on market-based terms. There\n            are three components to the project. The first component is\n            the increase capital investment by rural enterprises - rural\n            development fund. This component, the Rural Development Fund\n            (RDF), is designed to address the term financing constraints\n            of financial institutions to provide funding to rural\n            enterprises for longer-term investment needs. The goal is to\n            enable rural private entrepreneurs to access medium to\n            long-term financing for capital investments, such as\n            equipment and new technologies, which will enable\n            opportunities for efficiency gains and business expansion.\n            The second component is the increase access to microfinance\n            in the rural economy - micro-finance loan fund. This\n            component, the Micro-finance Loan Fund (MLF), will provide a\n            small line of credit to demonstrate the commercial viability\n            of lending to micro-enterprises and household businesses.\n            These may be defined as formal and informal businesses\n            employing 2-3 employees outside of their immediate families.\n            Finally, the third component is the build institutional\n            capacities and new products. The institutional building\n            component is a core element to the success of the RFIII\n            project. This component is designed to help strengthening\n            the financial institutions participating in the project and\n            demonstrating a credible strategy for expanding access to\n            finance in rural areas of Vietnam. This component is also\n            designed to help demonstrate that new markets can be found\n            and that these can be commercially viable. These new markets\n            can come in the form of new customers, new products and\n            services, and new institutions participating in the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Third Rural Finance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam -
