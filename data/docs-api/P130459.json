Sound macroeconomic policies coupled with\n            limited external imbalances have helped Poland maintain\n            economic growth despite the slowdown and economic\n            uncertainty in Europe since 2008. Notwithstanding these\n            positive developments over the past few years, Poland is not\n            immune to the protracted recession in the Euro area.\n            Poland's economy has performed well during and after\n            the 2008 global financial crisis. Strong macroeconomic\n            fundamentals, including limited macroeconomic imbalances at\n            the onset of the crisis, large and diversified domestic\n            economy, close trade and supply chain linkages to Germany\n            and adequate policy mix prior to and during the crisis,\n            helped the economy withstand external shocks. The growth in\n            government spending was contained by: a) a temporary fiscal\n            rule limiting increases in all newly enacted and existing\n            discretionary expenditure items to one percentage point over\n            the rate of inflation (CPI); and b) a nominal freeze of the\n            budgetary sphere wage bill, and c) phasing out of early\n            retirement schemes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Second Public Finance Development\n            Policy Loan Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland - Second Public Finance\n            Development
