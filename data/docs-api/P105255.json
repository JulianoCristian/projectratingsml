Some lessons learned included: first,\n            strong Government ownership of the reform program was\n            crucial to the success and rapid pace of the PRSO series.\n            The authorities took the lead in identifying and\n            implementing the reform program, with the Bank playing a\n            catalytic and supportive role in identifying ways to enhance\n            what the Government had already decided to implement on an\n            accelerated time schedule. Second, the strong focus of the\n            Government on results was vital in driving implementation of\n            the reform agenda. The authorities were sharply focused on\n            achieving specific development outcomes and results, and the\n            PRSO team supported the authorities in developing a detailed\n            set of monitorable outcome indicators to track results from\n            implementation of the reform program. Third, the\n            programmatic approach afforded important flexibility to\n            advance and deepen reform implementation in several areas\n            and reduce the scope of or provide additional time for\n            implementation in other areas. Fourth, strong donor\n            coordination to strengthen the Government's\n            implementation capacity was essential. The Bank's\n            projects and other donors provided important technical\n            assistance to build capacity in key areas. Areas in which\n            Bank projects complemented the reforms supported by the PRSO\n            series included public sector reform, education, and health\n            care. Finally, reform progress can be achieved in areas\n            without a clear reform champion if the area is selected\n            carefully and if a flexible approach is adopted. A number of\n            areas in serious need of reform, including external audit,\n            civil service and procurement, lacked a clear reform\n            champion. Given that the PRSO program was broad and\n            ambitious, the Bank was selective in pursuing challenging\n            reform areas that lacked a reform champion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia -

efforts to sustain\n            implementation of the PRSO program in the face of\n            unanticipated budget constraints associated with the August\n            2008 conflict. The PRSO reform program focuses on four\n            critical reform pillars: (i) strengthening public sector\n            accountability, efficiency, and transparency; (ii) improving\n            electricity and gas sector services; (iii) improving the\n            environment for private sector development; and (iv)\n            improving social protection, education, and health care\n            services. The reforms aim at developing a dynamic and\n            competitive private sector as the main engine of growth,\n            with the state playing a supportive role by providing basic\n            public goods and services. These development strategies,\n            reflected in Georgia's poverty reduction strategy paper\n            (PRSP), have served the country well. Driven by rapidly\n            rising foreign direct investment (FDI) flows of about $1.5\n            billion per year, which translated into domestic investment\n            of 28 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), GDP growth\n            averaged 10.5 percent per year over the last three years and\n            reached 12.4 percent in 2007. During the same period,\n            inflation was on average 8.7 percent per year, though it\n            accelerated to 11 percent in 2007. Private capital inflows\n            financed the large external current account deficit while\n            international reserves increased from $881 million in 2006\n            to $1,361 million in 2007, and to $1,550 million by end-July\n            2008 (or about 2.6 months of imports). At the same time,\n            external debt declined from 46 percent of GDP in 2003 to\n            16.7 percent in 2007."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Proposed supplemental credit to\n

Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO IV) and is\n            intended to continue to support the Government of Georgia in\n            the implementation of policy reforms in the areas of: (i)\n            strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and\n            transparency; (ii) improving electricity and gas sector\n            services; (iii) improving the environment for private sector\n            development; and (iv) improving social protection, education\n            and health care services. PRSO IV will be the last of this\n            PRSO series, although the Georgian authorities have\n            indicated interest in a possible follow-up programmatic\n            development policy credit series. At the beginning of the\n            PRSO series, the then new administration faced enormous\n            challenges, and the primary objective of the PRSO series was\n            to support selected reforms necessary to pull Georgia out of\n            a failing state scenario and to mitigate the risks of\n            derailment in of the reform process. For operational\n            purposes, the program is organized into four pillars: (i)\n            strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and\n            transparency; (ii) improving electricity and gas sector\n            services; (iii) improving the environment for private sector\n            development; and (iv) improving social protection, education\n
