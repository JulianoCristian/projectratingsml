With approximately 60 percent of the population\n            living below the poverty line in 2009, Honduras has\n            historically been one of the poorest countries in Latin\n            America. It reflects weak economic growth and recurrent\n            macroeconomic imbalances, vulnerability to natural\n            disasters, and a long legacy of periodic mismanagement. As\n            part of the effort to improve accountability and governance,\n            the Poverty Reduction Support Technical Assistance Credit\n            (PRSTAC) project built on multi-stakeholder engagement,\n            which included several government agencies and sectors.\n            Sweden, Japan, the UK, and the International Development\n            Association (IDA) together provided financing for the\n            project. With IDA roots in the heavily-indebted poor\n            countries initiative and the poverty reduction strategy\n            processes, donor coordination in Honduras has evolved and\n            built around aid partnerships.
