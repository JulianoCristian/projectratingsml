Some lessons\n            learned included: a macro-scale lesson may be derived from\n            the wide range of good effects, in cadastre, land\n            consolidation, environmental land use, village industries\n            and works including water-saving irrigation - which came\n            because both the Government and the Bank restructured the\n            project. Both remained alert to the possibilities of using\n            this vehicle to try new and innovative programs, rather than\n            the easy road of simply closing down an operation, and their\n            courage was rewarded. One reason for the relatively high\n            degree of success of the diverse investment program\n            introduced at the restructuring in 2005 was that the new\n            subcomponents were generally delegated to regular line\n            agencies rather than stand-alone project management units,\n            thus building ownership and expertise ready and able to\n            carry on after project closing. A final general lesson is\n            that one of the best forms of monitoring and evaluation,\n            particularly of new, dispersed programs, is to conduct\n            windscreen surveys or rural appraisals by proven,\n            experienced and independent experts. In a couple of weeks,\n            very large samples of participants across as many as 15\n            provinces can be interviewed in depth, near their homes,\n            workshops and fields, with possibly more candid results and\n            fuller understanding than produced through formal\n            statistical surveys."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Agricultural Reform Implementation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Agricultural Reform\n            Implementation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/11/11522140/turkey-agricultural-reform-implementation-project","projn":"TR-Agricultural Reform Implementation\n            Project (Arip) -- P070286","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","count":"Turkey","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20091216230906"},"theme":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Rural policies and institutions,Land administration and management","subsc":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,Crops,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural reforms;

In pursuing this objective, the Bank\n            and the Government agreed on an Agricultural Policy Paper in\n            April 2004. The principles and specific agricultural\n            policies agreed in this Agricultural Policy Paper have\n            recently been incorporated into the Government's draft\n            Framework Agricultural Law, which mandates their\n            implementation through a refined set of agricultural policy\n            instruments and investments over the period 2006-2010. The\n            restructuring of the ARIP's components directly\n            supports the implementation of a number of the agricultural\n            policy instruments and investments laid out in the Framework\n            Agricultural Law. To date, the investment support activities\n            offered farmers under the Farmers Transition component, have\n            been limited to tobacco and hazelnut farmers who choose to\n            switch out of these formerly supported crops. However, with\n            weak uptake of these ARIP-supported programs (for reasons\n            described below), the Government has requested that the\n            Farmers Transition component be broadened to include\n            activities aimed at supporting land consolidation of highly\n            fragmented farm holdings, village-based participatory\n            investments, greater capacity building for farmers\n            organizations, and farmers in environmentally fragile areas\n            who wish to switch out of crops in oversupply. The proposed\n            restructuring of the ARIP also extends the scope of the\n            Agricultural Sales Cooperative Unions (ASCU) component to\n            the participation by ASCUs in the emerging practice of\n            warehouse receipts-based financing. The revised procurement\n            plan has been reviewed and approved by the Bank project\n            team's procurement staff. The amendment to the loan\n            agreement is in compliance with the Articles of the Bank,\n            and it is thus recommended to approve same on no objection basis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -

aimed at reducing subsidies, substituting a support\n            system for agricultural producers, and agro-industries, with\n            incentives to increase productivity, responsive to real\n            comparative advantages. The components will: 1) finance\n            support to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs\n            (MARA) for the establishment of the National Registry of\n            Farmers, and of the Land Registration and Cadastre Office,\n            which includes a complete computerization of existing land\n            registry records. Institutional capacity building at\n            MARA's provincial, and local offices will be provided,\n            through technical assistance (TA) for registry best\n            practices, training, and provision of equipment, and\n            software; 2) support farmers in the transition to\n            alternative activities, as governmental support is reduced.\n            The cropping area expansion of primarily hazelnut, and\n            tobacco led to significant surplus production, including\n            misuse of agricultural resource bases. Thus, based on the\n            areas to be reduced, payments to farmers will be provided in\n            the form of uprooted costs; input costs for new crops; and,\n            transition costs. Crop replacement options include maize,\n            soybean, sunflower, beans and vegetables, and medicinal\n            plants; 3) assist in the implementation of the Law on\n            Agricultural Sales Cooperatives, through restructuring\n            measures, and cooperative development programs, financing\n            labor retrenchment, and expenses associated with the\n            Restructuring Board. Consulting services, TA, and training\n            will be provided; and, 4) provide project support services,\n            such as public information campaigns, advisory services,\n            monitoring and evaluation, and management activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Agricultural Reform Implementation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Agricultural Reform\n
