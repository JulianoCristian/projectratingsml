Excluding the 'Unallocated'\n            funds, the FSTA project had only three disbursement\n            categories. This breakdown facilitated the addition of new\n            activities, and the switching of funds targeted for one\n            activity to without being subject to lengthy change\n            procedures, either in Azerbaijan or in the Bank. Important\n            synergies can be realized through good cooperation between\n            the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bank. During\n            project preparation, Bank and IMF staff worked as one team\n            both in the elaboration of the strategy and the design of\n            the technical assistance needed to implement the strategy.\n            Throughout implementation, the IMF both continued to support\n            the program and provided advisory services (especially\n            relating to the payments system architecture) that\n            complemented the International Development Agency (IDA)\n            funded assistance and Bank team. This close collaboration\n            was an important factor in the initial and sustained strong\n            commitment to the banking sector reform strategy, as well as\n            in the successful outcome of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Financial Sector Technical\n            Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Azerbaijan - Financial Sector\n
