Guinea - Cocoa Rehabilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Government's top priority for\n            the country's agricultural sector includes restoring\n            cocoa production and exports so as to generate foreign\n            exchange and to redress a marked negative trade balance.  In\n            accordance with this priority, the objectives of the\n            proposed project are:  (a) alleviating the constraints\n            currently impeding the increased production of cocoa; and\n            (b) establishing the necessary infrastructure to maintain\n            the momentum of development in the cocoa sub-sector in the\n            future.  To achieve these objectives, project actions would:\n            (a) provide agricultural credit to meet the seasonal,\n            medium-term, and long-term financing needs of creditworthy\n            farmers and cooperatives.  This would include strengthening\n            the capacity and operational efficiency of the Ministry of\n            Agriculture, Livestock, and Rural Development (MOA) and the\n            project implementing agencies.  The project would accomplish\n            this through the international recruitment of five\n            specialists, on-the-job and overseas training of local\n            staff, improvement of buildings and operating facilities,\n            and provision of vehicles and office equipment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Equatorial Guinea - Cocoa Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Equatorial Guinea - Cocoa\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/01/741645/equatorial-guinea-cocoa-rehabilitation-project","projn":"GQ-Cocoa Rehab-320005 -- P000638","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Environment,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Equatorial Guinea","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3971023104135"},"subsc":"(Historic)Perennial crops","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative procedures,Afrique\n            Centrale,agricultural development,agricultural\n            inputs,agricultural investment,agricultural\n            investments,agricultural management,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,Audits,average yields,Cacao,Canadian\n            International Development Agency,capita\n            incomes,cassava,cattle,Central Bank,CIDA,climatic\n            zones,Cocoa,Coffee,coffee exports,coffee\n            production,cola,commodities,commodity,comparative\n            advantage,cooperatives,crop,crop production,crop\n            protection,cropping,Cultivation,dairy\n            products,Debt,deforestation,devaluation,development\n            agencies,development projects,division of labor,dry\n            beans,ecological conditions,ecology,Economic\n            Development,economic growth,Economic Justification,economic\n            performance,Economic Rate of\n            Return,employment,equipment,export\n            crops,extension,FAO,Farm,farm\n            incomes,Farmers,Farms,fertilizer,fish,fishing,foodcrops,Forestry,fruits,GDP,goats,horticultural\n            crops,housing,husbandry,IFAD,Imports,Income,input\n            use,Interest Rate,International Trade,ITC,Livestock,"},"1":{"cdata!":"administrative procedures,Afrique\n            Centrale,agricultural development,agricultural\n            inputs,agricultural investment,agricultural\n            investments,agricultural management,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,Audits,average yields,Cacao,Canadian\n            International Development Agency,capita\n            incomes,cassava,cattle,Central Bank,CIDA,climatic\n            zones,Cocoa,Coffee,coffee exports,coffee\n            production,cola,commodities,commodity,comparative\n            advantage,cooperatives,crop,crop production,crop\n            protection,cropping,Cultivation,dairy\n            products,Debt,deforestation,devaluation,development\n            agencies,development projects,division of labor,dry\n            beans,ecological conditions,ecology,Economic\n            Development,economic growth,Economic Justification,economic\n            performance,Economic Rate of\n            Return,employment,equipment,export\n            crops,extension,FAO,Farm,farm\n            incomes,Farmers,Farms,fertilizer,fish,fishing,foodcrops,Forestry,fruits,GDP,goats,horticultural\n            crops,housing,husbandry,IFAD,Imports,Income,input\n            use,Interest Rate,International Trade,ITC,Livestock,"}},"owner":"WB Off: Yaounde-Central Africa 1 (AFCC1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"4933"},"facets":{}}}
