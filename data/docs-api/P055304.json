Lessons learned include:\n            the division of land administration activities between\n            Surveying and Mapping Authority (SMA) for cadastre and the\n            Supreme Court for registration resulted in coordination\n            difficulties between the two agencies in the first several\n            years of the project. Also, with cadastre separate from\n            registration, cross-subsidization from the higher revenues\n            of registration to cadastre with lower earning possibilities\n            is made difficult by the institutional divide. RERMP's\n            housing finance and mortgage reform component is in the\n            banking rather than land domain, but was a significant\n            contributor to RERMP's goal to improve the efficiency\n            of the land market. Inclusion of this component was within\n            Slovenia's implementation capacity. While a focused\n            land administration project will generally be preferred,\n            addition to a project of a high impact ancillary component\n            may be beneficial if manageable by the institution\n            concerned. Development of a legal base for land\n            administration, which was minimal before RERMP, was,\n            appropriately, prioritized by Government and the Bank, and\n            laws were passed to provide a structured legislative\n            framework. Laws were proactively amended as experience was\n            gained, and legislation in related sectors (mortgages,\n            taxes) was also approved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Slovenia - Real Estate
