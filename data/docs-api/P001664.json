Lessons learned: Avoid the\n            'Christmas tree' projects attempting to tackle all\n            important issues at once through many components and complex\n            design. In projects with a significant institutional\n            development aspect, base the project design on a realistic\n            assessment of the Borrower's existing and potential\n            future institutional capacity. Remember that both the Bank\n            and the Borrower typically overestimate Borrower's\n            current and potential capacity. Ensure that risks identified\n            at entry are tracked and mitigated on an ongoing basis, and\n            that responses are commensurate - in timing and magnitude -\n            to the seriousness of the risks. Carry out a detailed\n            implementation review early (before mid-term) to allow ample\n            time for identifying and addressing potential problems, and\n            ensuring that measures mitigating against risks identified\n            at entry are adequate. Clarify the objectives of any\n            capacity-building activities in terms of enhanced ability to\n            perform in specific areas, rather than simply gaining\n            knowledge. Base indicators of capacity building on\n            application of new skills (output/outcome) rather than\n            training or equipment/facilities provided (inputs). Stress\n            practical hands-on experience and targeted skills-building\n            over general academic training. Stretch capacity-building\n            budgets by emphasizing in-country and on-the-job training\n            over external courses. Effective coordination of support\n            from different donors may fail because it is beyond the\n            capacity of the Borrower or, sometimes against the interests\n            of particular agencies or individuals. While donor\n            coordination is the Borrower's responsibility, donors\n            should also take care to promote complementarity and\n            consistency of their support, avoid overwhelming government\n            agencies, and avoid creating opportunities and incentives\n            for \"double-dipping\" (two or more donors funding\n            the same activity) or other inefficient use of resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Environmental Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi - Environmental Management

There are\n            four components: (1) Institutional strengthening of the\n            environment information system, including support for\n            training and operations, to enable MOREA to carry out its\n            policy, monitoring, and control functions; and training of\n            line departments, regional and district administrations, and\n            nongovernmental

system; (c) improve the quality of environmental information\n            and access; and (d) identify formal and non-formal systems\n            for information dissemination; (3) Developing the capability\n            of communities to manage natural resources through: (a)\n            NGO-managed activities, including mobilizing communities and\n            running micro-projects to finance

(4) Environmental actions and studies on\n            climate change and long lead forecasting, water hyacinth\n            control, bilharzia control, national park management; and\n
