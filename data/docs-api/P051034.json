Furthermore, turnover on the\n            country team limited program effectiveness, diminishing the\n            continuity of the program, and probably constraining the\n            Economic and Sector Work (ES W) that was performed,\n            suggesting a more robust, timely ESW program would have been\n            beneficial to the design of the reform program, while the\n            turnover among policy officials hindered reform progress."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia -
