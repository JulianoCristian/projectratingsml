Ratings for the First and Second Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit (PRSC I and II) Projects for\n            Mozambique are as follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to\n            the development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects included: 1)\n            the very good macroeconomic performance sustained by\n            Mozambique over the last two decades suggests that as long\n            as the country is following prudent and effective\n            macroeconomic stabilization and management policies in the\n            context of ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n            programs, it is sufficient for the Bank's assistance\n            program, as has been done in the context of the EMPSO and\n            the PRSC series, to base its evaluation of macroeconomic\n            developments on IMF's assessment, and to provide\n            ancillary support, without devoting major extra efforts\n            itself across the whole spectrum within this policy area; 2)\n            the experience of Mozambique also suggests that the PRSC/GBS\n            modality seems to have yielded broadly satisfactory results,\n            which have been at least as good as alternative modalities,\n            but with the added advantage of having the country itself\n            leading its development agenda and playing a central role in\n            coordinating the assistance from its development partners.\n            The presumption of a proven track record, while not a\n            guarantee for continued success, is an important\n            pre-condition. Close monitoring and evaluation by the\n            country and its partners during implementation is also very\n            important; 3) the experience of the financial sector and\n            that of the telecommunications and air transport sectors,\n            suggests that accompanying budget support, or development\n            policy loan (DPL) operations, with related technical\n            assistance (TA) may increase the chances for success.\n            However, for more complicated sectors like private sector\n            development (PSD), or agricultural and rural development,\n            this may not be sufficient, and there may be a need for\n            additional interventions; and 4) stability in the\n            composition of Bank and counterpart project teams, and close\n            involvement of staff of the Bank's office in Maputo at\n            all stages of project preparation and implementation are\n            important for increasing the chances of success of\n            Bank-supported operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Economic Management and Private\n            Sector Operation Project; and First and Second Poverty\n
