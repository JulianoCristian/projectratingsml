Increased annual\n            production would be about 430,000 tons of fruits and 11,000\n            tons of aquatic products, mainly fish. In addition, lending\n            for the establishment or expansion of animal breeding and\n            fish nurseries would help satisfy the growing demand from\n            individual households for improved stock, while increasing\n            the supply of red meat, poultry and eggs.

development of citrus orchards and other\n            tree crops, aquaculture, livestock and agro-processing.\n            Project funds would be channelled through the Agricultural\n            Bank of China (ABC) to subborrowers comprising collective\n            units, individual farmers and households, and state-owned\n            enterprises.

Increased annual\n            production would be about 430,000 tons of fruits and 11,000\n            tons of aquatic products, mainly fish.  In addition, lending\n            for the establishment or expansion of animal breeding and\n            fish nurseries would help satisfy the growing demand from\n            individual households for improved stock, while increasing\n            the supply of red meat, poultry and eggs. The project would\n            provide funds to sub-borrowers in Hubei Provinc finance\n            investments for the development of aquaculture, livestock,\n            and crops.
