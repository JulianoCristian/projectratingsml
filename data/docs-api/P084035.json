Some lessons learned\n            included: projects need to calculate the volume of works,\n            consider seasonal prevalence of works and work out realistic\n            costing/budgeting at project preparation and design to avoid\n            mistakes.

FVWRMP spent time to\n            convince some farms to implement restructuring, while there\n            were other farms that were very keen to restructure. The\n            project should have prioritized these farms and proceeded on\n            a demand-driven basis at least to begin with restructuring.\n            At additional financing and restructuring, FVWRMP included\n            the geotechnical study as part of the PDO. This study was a\n            complex task that also required greater resources than was\n            allocated to the activity.

It is to extend the closing date by an additional\n            year to May 31, 2014. The extension is necessary to complete\n            all works and strengthen the Water User Associations (WUAs).\n            Construction works can only be implemented during a few\n            months per year. As a result of this, some of the works have\n            been delayed. It would be challenging to recover these\n            delays as only a few months of effective construction time\n            remain before the closing date, by which time it is unlikely\n            that all works will be completed.
