Improvement Project for finance are improve: (i) the quality\n            of non-formal initial, basic (grades 1-9) and secondary\n            (10-12) education programs; (ii) the coverage and internal\n            efficiency of initial and basic education; and (iii) the\n            strategic planning and institutional performance of the\n            Ministry of Education at the central, regional and local\n            levels. Improving equity is considered a\n            universal/cross-cutting principle and therefore embedded in\n            each component of the project. There are three components to\n            the project. The first component of the project is to\n            improve learning processes at non-formal pre-school\n            programs, as well as in primary and secondary levels. This\n            component aims to advance the education quality in the\n            system through supply-side interventions on pedagogical\n            methods, curricular relevancy, promotion of Information\n            Technology (IT) literacy skills, and improved technical\n            capacity to measure student learning outcomes. The second\n            component of the project is to increase coverage and\n            retention of the school population in initial and basic\n            educational programs. This component seeks to expand\n            coverage of non-formal initial education programs, while\n            increasing the internal efficiency in the system from\n            pre-school to basic education (grades 1-9). The third and\n            final component of the project is to enhance institutional\n            capacity and performance of the Ministry of Education. This\n            component aims to support strategic investments to the\n            Ministry of Education (Ministerio de Educacion)\n            (MEDUCA's) to build institutional and technical\n            capacity to improve the administrative, management,\n            monitoring and evaluation performance of the education system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Education Quality Improvement

languages. There are two components to the\n            project. The first component of the project is to improve\n            the teaching and learning process in basic education. This\n            is can be achieved by: (i) elaboration of a\n            diagnosis/inventory to define and validate competencies of\n            teacher, directives and supervisors of basic education in\n            indigenous region; (ii) training of directives and\n            supervisors to correct the gaps detected in the diagnosis in\n            indigenous regions; and (iii) formulation of a proposal of\n            special IBE teacher training. The second component of the\n            project is to increase coverage and retention of students in\n            preschool and basic education age. Some of the activities\n            included in the project that involve the indigenous peoples\n            plan are: (i) expansion of IBE preschool (CEFACEI)\n            coordinate with DNEIB; (ii) expansion of telebasica in\n            indigenous regions. Coordinate with telebasica Dir; (iii)\n            adaptation of reinforcement programs with an intercultural\n            focus. Training of teachers to apply reinforcement programs\n            for students at risk of failing school in basic education in\n            indigenous regions; (iv) study to evaluate alternative\n            pedagogical proposals to serve students in highly disperse\n            indigenous regions; (v) carry out technical training for the\n            implementation of IBE model; and (vi) study to evaluate\n            alternative pedagogical proposals to serve students in\n            highly disperse indigenous regions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama -
