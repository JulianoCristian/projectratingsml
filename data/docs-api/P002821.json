Lessons reinforce the\n            importance of political commitment, key to the progress made\n            in implementing the project, particularly given its broad\n            scope, and complexity. This commitment helped strengthen\n            cooperation between the Government, and the Bank, and\n            provided the basis to focus assistance on redressing\n            technical, and capacity constraints. As such, modifications\n            of the social sector reforms, were feasible because of\n            political decision, with initiating actions for a much\n            stronger decentralization than initially envisaged.\n            Furthermore, technical assistance served to redesign the\n            program accordingly, and adopt a phased implementation plan,\n            namely because of Government commitments, which also\n            facilitated implementation of reforms by sector departments.\n            However, the sequencing of actions, and implementation time\n            frame may have been overly optimistic, although it did serve\n            a purpose in conveying a sense of urgency. For instance,\n            institutional, and structural measures had a medium-term\n            perspective, while the horizon of the project was mush\n            shorter; and, by the Bank taking into account this factor,\n            providing flexibility in the inclusion of floating tranches,\n            it allowed the Government a measure of control in timing its\n            actions, in spite of the Government's inexperience in\n            timing tranche releases, which are linked directly to budget\n            financing. Thus a more realistic time frame will be provided\n            under the follow-up operation, by building on the\n            medium-term perspective of the Government's program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Structural Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Structural Adjustment\n            Credit
