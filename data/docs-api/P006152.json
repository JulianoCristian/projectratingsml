Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: a) it is important for the Bank to bring issues of the\n            environment, ethnicity or gender to the development dialogue\n            in countries where these issues are still not on the agenda.\n            In the case of the Eastern Lowlands Project, International\n            Development Association (IDA's) role in introducing\n            environmental and indigenous concerns into the development\n            dialogue in Santa Cruz was crucial; b) it is important for\n            the Bank to explore other channels in civil society to solve\n            developmental or social problems. This was important in the\n            indigenous component where IDA's persistence and\n            patience in resolving the issues paid off. This was an\n            extremely conflictive issue that required several years to\n            solve but which IDA considered to be very important. Working\n            closely with civil society i.e. beneficiaries,\n            non-government organization (NGOs), churches etc., finally\n            led to a solution of the crisis. IDA insisting on a\n            declared\" bottom line\" result helped in this\n            sense; and c) mid-term reviews can be very useful when the\n            problems are clearly identified by both the Borrower and the\n            Bank. In this case, the mid-term review was very beneficial,\n            as the problems were clearly identified and the scope of the\n            restructuring was judicious. This restructuring led to a\n            refocusing on the \"public good\" issues that needed\n            to be financed to accompany the privately financed\n            development that was going on in the project area, i.e.\n            improvement of roads into small farmer areas, increased\n            research and extension on sustainable practices, and renewal\n            of commitment to indigenous issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Eastern Lowlands Natural Resource\n            Management and Agricultural Production Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - Eastern
