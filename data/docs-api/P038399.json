and 2)\n            to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the\n            irrigation schemes by introducing participatory management.\n            The project consists of the following five components: 1)\n            rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure in three regions\n            including Tikves, Bregalnica, and Polo; 2) an institutional\n            development program including subcomponents of: a) a series\n            of pilot programs to develop water user associations (WUAs),\n            improve on-farm irrigation practices, and explore the\n            possibilities for user participation in minor repairs; b) a\n            study on Bregalnica water resource management; and c)\n            support to restructuring water management organizations\n            (WMOs) through legal advice and technical support; 3) a\n            technical studies program for specific problems including\n            dam safety, algae, and repair of the systems; 4) project\n            administration and monitoring; and 5) implementation support\n            for WMOs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Irrigation Rehabilitation and\n            Restructuring
