The closing date for\n            Education for All - Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI)\n            Catalytic Trust Fund the will be extended from May 31, 2012\n            until July 7, 2013. A request for the extension of the\n            closing date dated April 19, 2012 was received from the\n            Government of Ethiopia. In the last ISR dated April 7, 2012,\n            the project development objective (PDO) was rated\n            satisfactory and implementation progress (IP) moderately\n            satisfactory. The project's objectives continue to be\n            achievable. The amount of undisbursed funds under the\n            EFA-FTI Catalytic Trust Fund is US$2.14 million equivalent\n            to 3.0 percent of the Grant. The extension should allow all\n            remaining funds under this Grant to be used by the closing\n            date of July 7, 2013, which is same as that of International\n            Development Association (IDA). The project closing date\n            extension is consistent with OP 13.30.
