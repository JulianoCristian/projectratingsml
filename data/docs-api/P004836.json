Regardless of success, key lessons\n            suggest: 1) The purpose of commissioning is merely to verify\n            flaws in the working system, but not to develop one; hence,\n            a good integration of system control, and design cooperation\n            is required to prod success. 2) Sound load forecasting is\n            required during project preparation, so that transformers,\n            and/or other equipment are not overloaded later on, when\n            decommissioned. 3) The appointment of independent monitoring\n            agencies for resettlement issues, is instrumental to control\n            the implementation of resettlement action plans, avoid\n            potential delays, resulting from disputes by project\n            affected people, and, ease coordination with local\n            authorities towards mutually agreed solutions. 4) Successful\n            complex operations do require above-average inputs of Bank\n            resources, and broad skills mix for project design,\n            appraisal, and supervision. 5) The establishment of a\n            procurement monitoring system within the project unit,\n            supported an effective control mechanism on internal\n            procurement decisions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Viet Nam -

The project has major environmental benefits\n            in the provision of an extra 80 MW generation capacity\n            without the consumption of extra fuel or additional\n            emissions to the atmosphere.  It will allow the\n            strengthening of the power supply system, the improvement of\n            living standards, and the development of industry and other\n            economic activities.   The main environmental issue that\n            arose was in relation to the cooling system.  The initially\n            selected system, which was a direct cooling system taking\n            water from the nearby Dinh river estuary, was not suitable\n            for environmental reasons.  The system eventually selected\n            was an air cooled condenser.  Planned mitigation measures\n            include noise control by the acoustic insulation of  new\n            plant as well as the treatment of all waste streams to the\n            required standard before discharge.  Because of the minor\n            residual negative impacts of the  development, no further\n            mitigation measures are required."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Power Sector Rehabilitation
