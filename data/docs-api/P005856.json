As the first stage of an\n            electrification scheme, it will also supply power for the\n            first time to many of the major population centers, reaching\n            by 1983 about 80,000 consumers or about 40 percent of the\n            total population in the Wadi, and to small industrial\n            consumers. Institution building objectives will be achieved\n            through technical assistance comprising training abroad of\n            PCEP's personnel, and consultants' services for a\n            tariff study, and a power development study. The project\n            faces no special risks but implementation delays could\n            result because of the remoteness of the project site and its\n            generally low level of development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"People's Democratic Republic of Yemen -\n            Wadi Hadramout Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"People's Democratic Republic\n            of Yemen - Wadi Hadramout Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/05/726844/peoples-democratic-republic-yemen-wadi-hadramout-power-project","projn":"RY-Power-269615 -- P005856","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Environmental Economics & Policies,Carbon Policy and Trading,Energy and Environment,Oil Refining & Gas Industry","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912392213"},"subsc":"(Historic)Thermal","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"air conditioning,alternative fuel,capacity\n            utilization,coal,consumption of energy,consumption of\n            oil,crude oil,Debt,diesel,diesel oil,Diesel Power,diesel\n            units,domestic use,drilling,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,electricity consumption,electricity\n            generation,Electricity Sales,electricity\n            supply,employment,Environmental\n            Impact,Expenditures,Farms,fish,Fuel Adjustment,fuel\n            consumption,Fuel Cost,fuels,Gas Oil,Gas Turbine,growth in\n            demand,heavy fuel oil,Heavy Oil,imports,Income,indigenous\n            energy,indigenous energy resources,industrial\n            expansion,Insurance,lighting,living conditions,Load\n            Growth,local electricity,marginal cost,National Oil,natural\n            gas,Oil Company,oil imports,oil price,oil products,Peak\n            Demand,petroleum,petroleum products,power generation,power\n            plants,power supply,surplus energy,total electricity\n            generation,turbine plant,utilities,waste,world oil"},"1":{"cdata!":"air conditioning,alternative fuel,capacity\n            utilization,coal,consumption of energy,consumption of\n            oil,crude oil,Debt,diesel,diesel oil,Diesel Power,diesel\n            units,domestic use,drilling,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,electricity consumption,electricity\n            generation,Electricity Sales,electricity\n            supply,employment,Environmental\n            Impact,Expenditures,Farms,fish,Fuel Adjustment,fuel\n            consumption,Fuel Cost,fuels,Gas Oil,Gas Turbine,growth in\n            demand,heavy fuel oil,Heavy Oil,imports,Income,indigenous\n            energy,indigenous energy resources,industrial\n            expansion,Insurance,lighting,living conditions,Load\n            Growth,local electricity,marginal cost,National Oil,natural\n            gas,Oil Company,oil imports,oil price,oil products,Peak\n            Demand,petroleum,petroleum products,power generation,power\n            plants,power supply,surplus energy,total electricity\n            generation,turbine plant,utilities,waste,world oil"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"repnb":"2002"},"facets":{}}}
