Some lessons learned include: 1)\n            precise definition and scheduling of works during project\n            preparation; 2) policy and institutional reforms undertaken\n            prior to major investments in works; 3) participatory\n            approach to reflect changing priorities in strategy updates;\n            4) appropriate financial management systems established to\n            guarantee accountability and transparency; 5) strengthened\n            procurement capacity; and 6) the use of local contractors as\n            capacity is built. Of these lessons, perhaps the one\n            embedded the most in the project design was the use of a\n            participatory approach to continuously reflect changing\n            priorities in

first phase of the Roads and\n            Bridges Management and Maintenance Project for Mozambique\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: Implementation delays due to\n            underestimated contract durations at the design stage,\n            delays in the decision-making process of the National Road\n            Administration (ANE), inadequate contract management, and\n            poor performance of some contractors and consultants\n            resulted in additional costs, loss of economic benefits that\n            were projected at project appraisal, and ineffective use of\n            national resources. Therefore, it is critical for the ANE to\n            carry out an assessment of institutional capacity and\n            develop work programs that can be delivered successfully\n            using agreed on time schedules. The coastal areas of\n            Mozambique have few naturally available materials suitable\n            for road building. The ANE needs to set up an information\n            system that will allow management to monitor project\n            performance and permit decision makers to take appropriate\n            actions.  For the road sector programs aimed at using the\n            sector wide approach with the concept of pooled funding, it\n            is important to reach a consensus with other Development\n            Partners (DPs) on the implementation arrangements\n            particularly on fiduciary aspects such as procurement and\n            financial management. The monitoring and assessment\n            framework should include a time based action plan to carry\n            out baseline studies, if needed, a well coordinated\n            mechanism for data collection, and the agency staff with\n            clear role and responsibilities for evaluation and reporting\n            of the project performance biannually."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique -

The Specific objectives of this project\n            will improve the coverage and condition of roads and\n            bridges; strengthen the country's capacity to manage\n            and administer the road sector effectively and\n            transparently, with efficient and sustainable institutional\n            arrangements; establish finance mechanisms to ensure\n            sufficiently, timely, stable, and secure flow of funds for\n            roads maintenance, affordable at the macroeconomic level and\n            for the road users; and improve road transport safety. The\n            project consists of three components: 1) The civil works\n            component will support roads routine and perodic\n            maintenance, roads rehabilitation, rural roads civil works,\n            emergency works, road safety, and engineering services for\n            road works. 2) The second component will establish an\n            institutional framework for the sector to ensure transparent\n            roads management and administration and support policy\n            reform. 3) The third component will support strategy and\n            preparatory activities for Phase II, which involve revising\n            and updating of the national integrated road sector strategy\n            and preparing environmental impact assessment and social\n

Project will adversely impact the\n            environment as a result of construction, and operation\n            activity in the area. During construction, vegetation and\n            fauna habitat losses will be mitigated by clearly marking\n            the work areas with pegs, identifying trees for retention,\n            and stockpiling shrub foliage for later use as brush layer,\n            and seed stock. Soil erosion, and sedimentation will be\n            controlled through the construction of diversion banks,\n            filter structures - fences of windrowed vegetation - and\n            sediment traps, and, in addition, vegetative propagation\n            should minimize the disturbed area. Drainage construction\n            should take place prior to, during, or immediately following\n            road excavation, to minimize scour, and sedimentation, and,\n            ensure that borrow pits, drain into sediment traps before\n            run-off is discharged off the site. Topsoil saving should be\n            the practice, to be re-used on completed road formation\n            batters, or areas approved by the Supervision Consultant.\n            During operations,
