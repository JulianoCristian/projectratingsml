During a previous mission in May 2010, the\n            Government of Uttar Pradesh (GoUP) was requested to identify\n            possible unutilized funds and to submit a request to the\n            Bank for a commensurate reduction in the loan amount. GoUP\n            subsequently undertook a detailed review of final project\n            costs and the estimated loan funding requirements up to\n            project closure. On this basis, the GoUP established that an\n            amount of US$28 million would remain unutilized. The planned\n            revised scope of work has remained mainly the same. GoUP\n            will be unable to utilize the remaining funds on any\n            additional works due to time constraints. The task team has\n            reviewed the request for cancellation.
