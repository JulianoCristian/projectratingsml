Turkey's\n            development strategy has placed greater emphasis on growth\n            of output through higher labor productivity, rather than\n            increased employment. As a result, the labor surplus,\n            including the estimated labor surplus in agriculture, rose\n            from about 1 million in 1962 to 1.6 million in 1972, about\n            10 percent of the labor force. Emigration has so far eased\n            the pressure on employment. Between 1965 and 1972, net\n            emigration amounted to about 400,000 and was expected to be\n            about 70,000 per year during the Third Plan period\n            (1973-77). The Third Plan continues to emphasize investment\n            in capital intensive industries, and projects a growth in\n            non-agricultural labor surplus by another 300,000 by 1977.\n            With the slowdown in Europe on employment of Turkish\n            workers, unemployment should be a major concern of economic\n            policy. Speedy implementation of land reform and rural\n            development programs would help to dampen migration from\n            rural to urban areas. In addition, labor intensive\n            production methods need special emphasis in the choice of\n            projects. However, even with these measures and faster\n            growth than planned in construction and services, urban\n            unemployment is likely to remain a serious problem."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
