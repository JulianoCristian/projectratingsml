Some lessons learned included: the\n            project was implemented from 2000 until 2011, and although\n            the implementation period was long, the project benefited\n            from staff continuity such as the task team leader (TTL) at\n            project closing date already becoming a task team member in\n            the second supervision mission in 2001, and assigned as the\n            TTL in 2004. Such staff continuity was crucial to ensuring\n            continued relationship with clients, and helped greatly to\n            manage the project efficiently. The ozone cell at Ministry\n            of Environment and Forest (MoEF) has limited human\n            resources, and after the project coordinator resigned and\n            the position became vacant in 2009, decision-making and\n            clearance process at the ozone cell became significantly\n            delayed towards project closure. The Bank's investment\n            in the relationship with Industrial and Development Bank of\n            India (IDBI) has been an important aspect of the successful\n            MP program in India. The smooth and effective functioning of\n            IDBI in the Third CFC Production Sector Closure Project (ODS\n            III) project is a testimony to the benefits of such a well\n            developed relationship."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
