Some\n            key lessons learned include: 1) Adjustment lending in itself\n            is an appropriate tool to engage a government in\n            telecommunications sector reform when the project supports a\n            champion or proponent of reform within the government. But\n            while identifying a clear leader is a legitimate tool to\n            jumpstart reform, it may need to be complemented by broader\n            stakeholder participation and buy-in to be sustainable.\n            Project effectiveness can be increased if technical\n            assistance is available to assist in the design and\n            implementation of the reforms. 2) The risk that personal\n            conflicts may affect the course of reform should be\n            mitigated through solid institution building and transparent\n            processes. During the implementation of the project,\n            personal relationships, more than the institutional setting,\n            played a crucial role in fostering and then stopping reform\n            3) The establishment of ANRT (the state telecommunications\n            regulatory agency) as an autonomous entity could have been\n            accompanied by the merger of the sector ministry in a larger\n            Ministry. The Bank could have placed a stronger emphasis on\n            separating the dual interest of the Government as owner of\n            Maroc Telecom, and members of the Board of ANRT (some\n            ministers still sit on both boards) before supporting the\n            privatization transaction. 4)  When supporting privatization\n            of a state-owned enterprise in a non-competitive sector,\n            consideration should be given to accompanying measures that\n            may be required to monitor and mitigate the risks of\n            consolidation and abuse of dominant position. 5) When moving\n            to a single tranche operation, other measures could have\n            been considered that could have limited the anticompetitive\n            developments that took place in the Internet and data\n            markets. These could have included: (a) measures that\n            allowed for the monitoring and sanctioning of predatory\n            pricing and cross-subsidies; (b) detailed provision of\n            enforcement instruments to allow the regulator to sanction\n            anticompetitive behavior; and (c) introduction of full\n            competition in international voice and data communications\n            in conjunction with the privatization transaction. 6) In the\n            postal sector as in many infrastructure sectors, governments\n            and incumbent operators tend to overstate the importance of\n            universal service costs. The Bank should have been more firm\n            in suggesting gradual liberalization, while carrying studies\n            to assess the cost of universal service."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Information Infrastructure Sector\n            Development Operation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Information\n            Infrastructure Sector Development Operation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/05/3516663/morocco-information-infrastructure-sector-development-operation-project","projn":"MA-Information Infrastructure Sector\n            Development Project -- P065736","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Knowledge Economy,ICT Policy and Strategies,Health Economics & Finance,Education for the Knowledge Economy,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Education","count":"Morocco","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040518130815"},"subsc":"Information technology,Telecommunications,Postal services,Other industry","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Information and communications,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"broadband networks,business\n            development,capital markets,Code Division Multiple\n            Access,collaboration,Communication Services,Communications\n            Technologies,competition policy,competitive\n            bidding,cryptography,data services,data\n            transmission,e-commerce,e-government,economic\n            growth,electricity,electronic commerce,electronic\n            transactions,Exchange Rate,financial autonomy,Gross Domestic\n            Product,ICT,income,Information Infrastructure,information\n            services,information systems,Information\n            Technology,international standards,Internet access,Internet\n            service provider,Internet service providers,Internet\n            services,ISP,leased\n            lines,licenses,licensing,media,networks,portals,postal\n            sector,postal sectors,Postal services,Postal Union,private\n            sector,private sector participation,provisions,Public\n            Offering,public use,Radio,regulatory agency,regulatory\n            framework,revenue sources,rural\n            teledensity,SAL,sanctions,savings,tax,Telecommunication,Telecommunications,telecommunications\n            infrastructure,telecommunications law,telecommunications\n            liberalization,telecommunications\n            networks,telecommunications sector,telecommunications\n            services,telephony,text,Universal Service,universal service\n            obligations,urban services"},"1":{"cdata!":"broadband networks,business\n            development,capital markets,Code Division Multiple\n            Access,collaboration,Communication Services,Communications\n            Technologies,competition policy,competitive\n            bidding,cryptography,data services,data\n            transmission,e-commerce,e-government,economic\n            growth,electricity,electronic commerce,electronic\n            transactions,Exchange Rate,financial autonomy,Gross Domestic\n            Product,ICT,income,Information Infrastructure,information\n            services,information systems,Information\n            Technology,international standards,Internet access,Internet\n            service provider,Internet service providers,Internet\n            services,ISP,leased\n            lines,licenses,licensing,media,networks,portals,postal\n            sector,postal sectors,Postal services,Postal Union,private\n            sector,private sector participation,provisions,Public\n            Offering,public use,Radio,regulatory agency,regulatory\n            framework,revenue sources,rural\n            teledensity,SAL,sanctions,savings,tax,Telecommunication,Telecommunications,telecommunications\n            infrastructure,telecommunications law,telecommunications\n            liberalization,telecommunications\n            networks,telecommunications sector,telecommunications\n            services,telephony,text,Universal Service,universal service\n            obligations,urban services"}},"owner":"Information & Communication Tech (TWICT)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026131-PHRD-SECOND POLICY REFORM\n            SUPPORT LOAN,TF036770-MOROCCO - TELECOM ADJUSTMENT\n            LOAN PROJECT,TF037721-ECA REGION - TELECOMMUNICATIONS,TF039101-MOROCCO - INFORMATION\n            INFRASTRUCTURE DEVE.

The project\n            supports a wide range of actions in the telecommunications,\n            information technology, and postal sectors, outlined in\n            section IV.B, in Annex 1 (Letter of Sector Development\n            Policy) and in Annex II (matrix of policy objectives and\n            actions). The development of a modern and diversified\n            information infrastructure will have a positive impact on\n            private sector development and economic growth, thus\n            contributing to poverty reduction. Extension of\n            communication and postal financial services to remote,\n            mainly rural areas will improve the living standards of the\n            rural population, thereby
