However, the Operations Evaluation Department\n            assessed both the project and the PCR as unsatisfactory\n            because of the failure to implement two important components\n            in the critical area of LPG distribution. On component had\n            to be partly abandoned due to the fact that the anticipated\n            feed was contingent on the completion of another project\n            which did not materialize; another component could not be\n            implemented due to higher than expected process quoted for\n            shallow-bottomed tankers. The project was also plagued by\n            the withdrawal of the top two choices for the general\n            contractor and a catastrophic cyclone in the Chittagong area\n            scattering material and work in progress. Institutional\n            development is rated as negligible, since there was no\n            progress on the LPG side, and the refinery already had a\n            satisfactory institutional structure before the project. The\n            prospects for sustainability of the project benefits are\n            likely. The Bank's performance is rated as\n            satisfactory, as it met the expectations of the Borrower\n            with regard to the refinery modification and LPG components.\n            The Borrower's performance is rated highly satisfactory\n            for operation, and satisfactory for preparation,\n            implementation, and covenant compliance. The most\n            significant lesson from this project is that effective,\n            results-oriented project preparation and design are keys to\n            efficient implementation. Particularly for Bangladesh, there\n            is a need to minimize the number of procurement packages and\n            to minimize the delays resulting from the approval process\n            by several layers of bureaucracy. Engagement of consultants\n            to work alongside the beneficiaries' staff facilitated\n            procurement. Finally, the dedication of the\n            beneficiaries' staff helped in a large measure to\n            implement the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Refinery Modification and LPG\n            Recovery and Distribution Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh -
