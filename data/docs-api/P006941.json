Among the lessons learned: 1) The time\n            period for loan approval needs to be taken into account in\n            the timeline for project implementation, yet at the same\n            time, it should be used by the Executing Agency to get ready\n            for the project execution by implementing studies, designs,\n            etc. 2) The Government's involvement in project\n            implementation was very limited. In future operations, a\n            mechanism should be established for a continuous dialog with\n            Government authorities, specifically the Ministries of\n            Health and Finance and the National Water Council. 3) The\n            project suffered considerable delays in execution due to\n            lack of support from the Costa Rican Water Supply and\n            Sewerage Institute's  (AyA) management for its\n            implementation during the initial years. Future operations\n            should establish better mechanisms for evaluating project\n            execution. The mid-term review ought to be supplemented with\n            evaluations at the start of each new administration. 4) Not\n            all of the Bank's procurement guidelines are compatible\n            with the Costa Rican procurement Law. During project\n            preparation the supralegality of the Bank procurement\n            guidelines was not recognized in Costa Rica. This created\n            implementation problems during the entire period of project\n            execution and led to situations that were impossible to\n            resolve. This lesson has not been capitalized, given that in\n            executing the first Bank operation (Loan 1935-CR), this was\n            one of the biggest challenges. For future operations, this\n            subject needs to be carefully analyzed and a solution to it\n            needs to be identified. 5) The approval of tariff increases\n            was one of the hurdles in the execution of the project. They\n            were not timely, nor do they adhere to clear negotiation\n            principles between the Executing Agency and Regulatory\n            Authority of Public Services  (ARESEP). 6) In the two water\n            sector projects partially financed by Bank Loans the\n            preparation of designs and bidding and contract documents\n            were causes for considerable delays. The time during which a\n            loan is in the process of approval within the country should\n            be used for implementing these activities. An itemized time\n            line and monitoring by sector authorities should be prepared\n            to reduce these delays. The use of external consulting\n            services is highly recommended for preparation of projects,\n            since it would free the institution from a considerable workload."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Second Water Supply and\n            Sewerage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Costa Rica - Second Water Supply\n            and Sewerage
