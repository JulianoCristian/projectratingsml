Some lessons learned included: the project\n            team carried out a close supervision of all Project\n            activities. Substantial resources and time were placed in\n            field works to ensure capacity building of beneficiaries and\n            to pass on the know-how the team itself had acquired through\n            training and technical support from the Bank. With extensive\n            work on the ground, the project succeeded in changing\n            mentalities and transforming behaviors in schools and\n            communities. The project was implemented with a highly\n            participatory approach. The beneficiaries and their\n            communities developed strong local ownership, which was\n            critical for the maintenance and sustainability of the\n            project outcomes. The participatory approach also enabled\n            the project implementation process to incorporate the\n            knowledge and skills of the local communities. Regional\n            Education Officers and staff were involved at all times\n            during the implementation of the project, such as training\n            and supervision and monitoring missions. This allowed them\n            to absorbed the standards and the procedures used by the\n            project team, which was important to the sustainability of\n            outcomes beyond the

In addition, the program\n            supports improvement of schools\u0092 organization of primary\n            level in Regions 1, 7, 8 and 9. To evaluate the program, the\n            Government of Guyana and the World Bank collected survey\n            data from schools, students, teachers and parents in three\n            rounds 2007, 2008 and 2009 in Regions 1 and 7. This report\n            shows the findings and impacts of SFP using all survey\n            rounds.  Regions 1 and 7 are characterized by high poverty\n            levels and agricultural labor intensity. Both factors\n            highlight the potential of organizing SFP around local\n            producers, so that a regular supply of low-cost food can be\n            guaranteed to the local schools and children living in\n            precarious conditions. Seventeen of the sixty-four schools\n            participating in the impact evaluation are in Region 7, and\n            the rest are in Region 1. Randomization for the selection of\n            comparison groups was not achieved, due to the participation\n            rules. However, sample selection correction methods were\n            used to correct for observable and unobservable biases. This\n            study's finding fall under the following topics:\n            enrollment and attendance, nutritional status,\n            students' classroom behavior and school performance,\n            academic performance by students, parental/community\n            participation, household diets, food prices shocks and SFP\n            as a safety net. Finally, the SFP\u2019s achievements with regard\n            to improving community participation in school activities\n            can make a key contribution in finding solutions to many of\n            the challenges faced by the Ministry of Education for\n            service delivery and quality education in rural, remote areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana's Hinterland Community Based\n
