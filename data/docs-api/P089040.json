Under Taliban rule (1996-2001), the\n            country was plagued by continuing conflict, and\n            international isolation. The education system was virtually\n            dismantled. Girls were officially excluded from the system.\n            Boys in school were taught a curriculum limited to religious\n            content. After the fall of Taliban in 2001, more and more\n            Afghan families returned home after living the war years as\n            refugees in neighboring countries. As a result village\n            populations across the country have swelled and there was\n            increased demand for education. Recognizing that education\n            would play a vital role in the reconstruction and\n            development of Afghanistan, World Bank\u2019s International\n            Development Association along with other international\n            partners launched a series of education programs aimed at\n            providing access and quality education at all levels with a\n            focus on girls. Specifically, these programs aimed to\n            reconstruct the education sector across the country. Since\n            2001, the projects have brought new life to education and\n            particularly benefited girls. Girls\u2019 enrollment skyrocketed\n            from 839,000 to more than 2.2 million, and boys\u2019 from 2.6\n            million to 3.9 million, the highest enrollment in the\n            history of Afghanistan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan girls' schools -

This paper\n            aims to inform this process by investigating a variety of\n            characteristics of children, such as their households,\n            educational facilities, community factors, and spatial\n            variables that are associated with education enrollment in\n            urban and rural Afghanistan. This paper aims to investigate\n            the factors underlying these low school enrollment figures\n            and is structured as follows. Section one reviews previous\n            research in this area. Section two provides a brief\n            description the data and the methodology used in this\n            analysis. In section three authors present the results which\n            are then discussed in section four. In fact this study found\n            that while the availability of appropriate schools is\n            significantly correlated with primary and mid-school\n            enrollment, they have a significant impact only on the\n            enrollment of rural girls in high school. Right now,\n            Afghanistan appears to be in a paradoxical situation: while\n            education and better human capital needs to power economic\n            growth, incomes need to expand to ease the constraints on\n            education enrollment that are currently imposed by economic\n            backwardness. To break out of this circle of constraints\n            against enrollment, policy makers need to aggressively\n            pursue policies that concentrate on easing the economic\n            costs to households of children attending school, while\n            enhancing the supply and quality of the facilities provided."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Educational attainment in Afghanistan : an\n            economic analysis"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Educational attainment in\n            Afghanistan : an economic analysis"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2013/07/18090609/educational-attainment-afghanistan-economic-analysis","count":"Afghanistan","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accessibility, age groups, Armed Conflict,\n            availability of schools, benefits of education, child\n            health, Child labor, communities, completion rate,\n            Completion Rates, disabled, disabled Child, educated\n            mothers, educated parents, education cycle, education\n            facilities, Education Outcomes, Education Statistics,\n            education system, EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, Educational\n            Development, educational facilities, educational facility,\n            Enrollment, enrollment figures, enrollment increases,\n            enrollment of boys, enrollment of children, enrollment of\n            girls, enrollment rate, Enrollment Rates, enrolment rate,\n            families, female enrollment, female enrollment rate, female\n            member, female teachers, Forced Migration, Gender, Gender\n            differentials, gender disparity, Gender Parity, GER, girls,\n            Gross Enrolment, Gross Enrolment Ratio, High School, Higher\n            Education, higher enrollment, Human Development, jobs, level\n            of education, literate parents, Middle School, movement, net\n            enrolment, net enrolment rate, old girls, older children,\n            onset of puberty, parental education, parental inputs, pass\n            rate, Primary education, primary enrollment, Primary School,\n            primary school enrollment, primary school enrolment, Public\n            Expenditure, refugees, rural areas, rural boys, rural girls,\n            Rural Women, school attendance, School Census, school walls,\n            schooling, schools, Secondary Education, secondary school,\n            secondary schools, Severe disability, social development,\n            society, teachers, teaching, violence, Working children,\n            young people"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Human development","projn":"AF-Afghanistan: Strengthening Higher\n            Education Program -- P089040","docty":"Working Paper (Numbered Series)","subtopic":"Disability,Youth and Governance,Education For All,Primary Education,Adolescent Health","teratopic":"Education,Governance,Health, Nutrition and Population,Social Protections and Labor","authors":{"authr":"Ebenezer, Roshini"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20130808130634"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education","theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Education for the knowledge economy","colti":"South Asia Human Development Sector report\n            no. 62","historic_topic":"Education,Governance,Health, Nutrition and Population,Social Protections and Labor","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Education (SASED)","trustfund":"TF092544-ARTF -

The link between education and increased individual\n            earnings has been widely documented: there is a large body\n            of cross-country evidence that education enhances the\n            employability, productivity and income earning capacity of\n            individuals. The impact of educational attainment on these\n            various socio-economic indicators has been shown to vary by\n            region, sub-region, gender, age, by income levels, and other\n            variables. In this paper, we focus on the socio-economic\n            impact of educational attainment in Afghanistan. Afghanistan\n            presents a fairly unique context for examining the\n            association between education and the socio-economic\n            variable discussed above. It is a conflict-affected country,\n            with strong and rich cultural and religious traditions. It\n            also has some of the worst developmental indicators and in\n            the world. Using data from the National Risk and\n            Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) survey of 2007/08, authors\n            investigate the extent to which the educational attainment\n            of men and women is associated with greater economic welfare\n            and less likelihood of being poor. The analysis is divided\n            into four parts: part one looks education and other factors\n            associated with household economic welfare and the\n            probability of being poor; part two focuses on the education\n            and other factors associated with women's participation\n            in the labor force; part three looks at the association of\n            mother's education with health-related outcomes of\n            children; and part four looks at the association between\n            educational attainment of girls and women, and their\n            perceptions of well-being. Afghanistan's education\n            indicators are among the worst in the world and girls and\n            rural communities are particularly disadvantaged."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Educational, economic welfare and subjective\n            well-being in Afghanistan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Educational, economic welfare and\n            subjective well-being in Afghanistan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2013/07/18090614/educational-economic-welfare-subjective-well-being-afghanistan","count":"Afghanistan","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"babies, Basic Needs, birth order, both\n            sexes, child health, child mortality, Child Survival,\n            child-bearing, Cognitive Skills, conflict, correlates of\n            poverty, dependency ratio, developing countries, diphtheria,\n            disability, economic development, Economic Growth, economic\n            opportunities, economic progress, educated mothers, educated\n            women, education variables, educational attainment,\n            enrollment, estimates of poverty, Experienced violence,\n            family members, female, female labor force, Females,\n            fertility, gender, gender differences, gender disparity,\n            Gender Equality, gender inequality, GER, health facilities,\n            health indicators, health outcomes, health workers,\n            hospital, household chores, Household Consumption, household\n            head, household head Age, household income, households,\n            human capital, Human Development, immunization, Impact of\n            Education, income earning capacity, income Transfers,\n            infant, Journal of Epidemiology, Labor Force, labor market,\n            level of education, levels of consumption, levels of\n            education, life expectancy, low birth weight, marital\n            status, maternal mortality, maternal mortality rate,\n            medicines, midwife, Ministry of Education, Mother, net\n            enrolment ratio, nurse, nutrition, nutrition outcomes,\n            Nutritional Status, occupations, Older women, Participation\n            rates, per capita consumption, Personality, policy goals,\n            Policy Research, Policy Research Working Paper, polio, polio\n            vaccine, Poor, poverty line, Poverty Lines, Poverty\n            REduction, Poverty Status, poverty threshold, Primary\n            completion, Primary completion rate, primary education,\n            Primary school, Psychology, quantitative research, Respect,\n            returns to education, Role of Women, Rural, rural areas,\n            rural communities, Rural girls, rural populations, rural\n            sector, rural women, School Teachers, schooling, secondary\n            education, Secondary school, sex, social progress, Social\n            Science, spouse, tetanus, tuberculosis, university\n            education, urban areas, urban women, vaccination,\n            Vulnerability, War, whooping cough, woman, Youth, Youth literacy"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Human development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","projn":"AF-Afghanistan - Second Education Quality\n            Improvement Program -- P106259,AF-Afghanistan: Strengthening Higher\n            Education Program -- P089040","docty":"Working Paper (Numbered Series)","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Housing & Human Habitats,Primary Education,Population Policies","teratopic":"Education,Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","authors":{"authr":"Ebenezer, Roshini"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20130808131031"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Secondary education,Primary education,Tertiary education","theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Gender,Education for all,Education for the knowledge economy","colti":"South Asia Human Development Sector report\n            no. 63","historic_topic":"Education,Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Education (SASED)","trustfund":"TF092544-ARTF - STRENGTHENING HIGHER\n            EDUCATION PROGRAM,TF091943-RISK ASSESSMENT OF COMMUNITY\n            MANAGED VS.
