The\n            sustained fiscal crisis in Pakistan after the first one to\n            two years of the project implementation constrained the\n            government's capacity to finance its share of the\n            overall program as agreed at the appraisal. A number of\n            important lessons have been learned through this project. 1)\n            Moving to a reproductive health approach can be helpful with\n            integration of services. 2) It is difficult to have\n            administrative decentralization in the presence of a\n            centralized funding mechanism. 3) The deployment of women as\n            trainers and supervisors greatly facilitates the recruitment\n            of female outreach workers. 4) Relying on the procurement of\n            technical assistance for institutional capacity development\n            is a risky strategy. 5) The experience with procurement\n            points to the critical importance of having an overall\n            detailed procurement plan before implementation starts. 6)\n            It is necessary to have a detailed appraisal of the\n            financial management system to be carried out at inception,\n            and for minimum improvements to be required and implemented\n            prior to approval of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

High fertility is part of a\n            web of poor social indicators in Pakistan, tied to slow\n            progress in the social sectors as well as poverty. The best\n            way to slow population growth will be to build demand for\n            smaller families through improvements in education and\n            economic opportunity, especially for women, and in\n            children's survival prospects, while supplying better\n            family planning information and services so that couples can\n            more easily limit fertility. Family planning will then\n            become a more appealing option. Pakistan's Social\n            Action Program, which covers primary education, primary\n            health care, population, and rural water supply, will\n            address both \"demand\" and \"supply\"\n            aspects of family planning. The Population Welfare Program\n            Project will contribute mainly by strengthening supply of\n            family planning information and services, to meet the demand\n            that already exists.

High fertility is part of a\n            web of poor social indicators in Pakistan, tied to slow\n            progress in the social sectors as well as poverty. The best\n            way to slow population growth will be to build demand for\n            smaller families through improvements in education and\n            economic opportunity, especially for women, and in\n            children's survival prospects, while supplying better\n            family planning information and services so that couples can\n            more easily limit fertility. Family planning will then\n            become a more appealing option.
