Some lessons learned included: even\n            though the census, as part of the comprehensive peace\n            agreement (CPA), had a lot of political dimensions which\n            were not in the Bank's terms of reference and domain of\n            expertise, supporting such an important activity can work as\n            long as the focus remains on the technical and\n            implementation areas. Census operations are highly\n            specialized and need major technical support, particularly\n            in countries with little relevant expertise and with major\n            logistical and political problems. United Nations Fund for\n            Population Activities (UNFPA) is the most-qualified\n            international organization to provide technical and\n            managerial census support, but its involvement is\n            unavoidably expensive and needs major field presence. The\n            Bank's decision to allow full payment of the grant\n            up-front provided UNFPA with maximum flexibility to carry\n            out speedy procurement. The Bank has to dedicate\n            considerable resources to its Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF)\n            administration, including the frequent and intensive\n            allocation of experienced technical and fiduciary staff, as\n            well as regular country and sector management involvement.\n            Although MDTF funding was limited and decided to be a\n            government responsibility, lack of government funding for\n            proper staff capacity building became an issue."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan -
