Some lessons\n            learned included:  The project confirmed that flexibility is\n            paramount in dealing with a project that is being\n            implemented while a major reform program is in progress.\n            Commitment and support of government at various levels and\n            strong ownership at the power utility level is a key to the\n            success of the sector reform and technical assistance (TA)\n            programs. Piloting has been a feature characteristic of\n            Chinese reform and Bank-assisted power sector projects.\n            Project elements explicitly designed to pilot new approaches\n            include: competitive provincial power market, comprehensive\n            Distribution Management System (DMS), condition-based\n            maintenance, and leasing arrangement for a peaking\n            generation plant. This approach, coupled with flexibility in\n            the use of loan funding for low-cost high impact TA, could\n            be a successful means to further reform and innovations.\n            Delays in government clearance and approval process resulted\n            in significant delays of project implementation. Effective\n            re-scheduling and re-organizing project construction\n            activities by experienced implementing agencies can often\n            catch up delays during the project implementation and\n            minimize the impacts. Cost estimates proved to be too high\n            and resulted in excessive front-end fee and commitment\n            charges to the Borrower. Significant cost savings were also\n            achieved by a number of other Bank-assisted power\n            project's in China. In-depth review of project design\n            and unit prices could help reduce unnecessary financing costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Tongbai Pumped Storage

implementing competitive generation markets in the\n            Zhejiang Province. These objectives will be supported by the\n            following components: 1) The development of the Tongbai\n            pumped storage power plant, based on an existing upper\n            reservoir, will consist of a new lower reservoir, impounded\n            by a dam, with connecting tunnels, and an underground\n            powerhouse. An environmental management plan will be\n            implemented, as will a resettlement action plan to protect\n            the affected population. In addition, the component includes\n            consulting services, for engineering, design, procurement,\n            and construction management assistance. 2) The transmission\n            reinforcement comprises erection of twin transmission lines\n            connecting the Tongbai plant to a 500 kv grid, and\n            construction of substations. Existing substation lines will\n            be expanded, and telecommunication equipment will be\n            supplied, covering customer service centers. 3) A\n            competitive program for power market development, and sector\n            restructuring will be implemented."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

Possible negative impacts caused\n            by project construction will be offset by the following\n            countermeasures: The unstable slope caused by the large\n            variation in the water level of the upper and lower\n            reservoirs will be closely monitored. A flood releasing\n            tunnel built will be set up and people alerted when the\n            reservoir is being discharged. Project affected persons will\n            be resettled locally and the land resources available per\n            capita will be minimally changed. To offset negative impacts\n            to the ecological environment in the resettlement host area,\n            the area will be afforested and protected as a bamboo, tea,\n            and fruit tree zone to attract tourists. A wastewater\n            discharge plan will alleviate the impact of sewage discharge\n            on water quality. Artificial watering will control quarry\n            construction and road pavement dust. Vehicle washing in the\n            area of the lower reservoir will avoid water pollution in\n            the area of the upper reservoir. Waste oil will be burned or\n            shipped away; and wastewater from mechanical equipment will\n            be centrally treated before discharge. Sewage will be\n            diverted to septic tanks, and the manure used as fertilizer,\n            while dining hall sewage will be discharged through an\n            oil-separation pool.
