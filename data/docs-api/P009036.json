Some lessons learned included: (i)\n            entrepreneurs like predictable debt service obligations and\n            prefer assuming the foreign exchange risk rather than\n            covering it at the cost of fluctuating relative and high\n            interest rates; (ii) in an economy with a high rate of\n            inflation, sound economic and financial returns can be\n            obtained if lending activities are sheltered from the\n            effects of inflation through appropriate interest rate\n            mechanisms; (iii) free-standing permanent working capital\n            loans with long-term maturities can be vital for the\n            enterprises in an economy where banks are reluctant to\n            provide medium-to-long term financing, due to macro-economic\n            uncertainty; and (iv) for export-oriented enterprises,\n            borrowing in foreign exchange does not entail the same\n            degree of FE risk as is the case for
