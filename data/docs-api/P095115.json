Some lessons learned included: the project was\n            an essential component of the government's larger well\n            implemented energy efficiency programs and was aligned with\n            the government's program to improve living conditions\n            in the Chernobyl affected area. The project did not require\n            changes in pricing and subsidies given the government\n            policies particularly in the Chernobyl affected area, the\n            targeted beneficiaries, and the overall level of\n            relationship with the country in terms of policy dialogue.\n            By supporting a project with local (improve living\n            conditions), national (reduce energy intensity), and global\n            (reduce global emissions) objectives, the Bank created an\n            environment of confidence conducive to continued future\n            dialogue with Belarus on these important issues.\n            Participation of users and beneficiaries increases their\n            understanding of and commitment to the project and improves\n            end results. Not allowing design consultants affiliated with\n            the Sub-Borrower to participate in the project limited the\n            pool of eligible local design consultants available in the\n            market and constrained the potential for capacity building.\n            Increased awareness of contractors about project bidding\n            opportunities in the early stages of the project (appraisal)\n            helps to limit delays. The establishment and revision of\n            baselines and targets that are directly related to project\n            outputs simplify measurement, monitoring and association\n            with the project outcomes. Continuous dialogue between the\n            Bank and the government teams facilitates timely resolution\n            of problems, limits delays, and builds strong relations for\n            future dialogue."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Belarus - Post-Chernobyl Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Belarus - Post-Chernobyl Recovery
