Some lessons\n            learned included: continuity of Bank and Borrower staff\n            helps to create mutual respect and understanding which in\n            turn facilitates resolution of problems that arise during\n            implementation. Close involvement of an experienced\n            Borrower/Implementing Agency in project design, together\n            with attentiveness to their views, helps to build a\n            cooperative relationship between the Bank and the\n            Borrower/Implementing Agency. Continuous donor coordination\n            and allocation of resources can result in expeditious\n            implementation of a large project. Flexible load following\n            generation capacity should be developed and made available\n            before the launch of a balancing market."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan - North-South
