The\n            second component, which focuses on knowledge sharing and\n            partnership building, comprises three sets of activities: 1)\n            information, education, and communication activities; 2)\n            building \"bridging\" social capital by creating\n            networks of \"graduating\" community-based\n            organizations and facilitating continued partnership between\n            local authorities and CBos, especially in the area of\n            sustainability; and 3) building linkages with other national\n            poverty reduction agencies and with project s with similar\n            set-up in the Region.
