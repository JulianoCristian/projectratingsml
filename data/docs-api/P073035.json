Some lessons learned included:\n            well-designed incentives can link landless families to\n            credit and service markets and enable the poor to\n            dramatically expand their asset base; the alliance\n            constructed with private financial institutions clearly has\n            great potential for the long-term and should become a key\n            element in the proposed Rural Competitiveness Project; the\n            approach to creating viable economic alternatives\n            demonstrated in PACTA is equally or more suitable to groups\n            that already possess land, including forest and indigenous\n            communities, small landholders titled by the state, and the\n            agrarian reform sector; the concept of alliances acquires\n            substance within a given territory, with given\n            environmental, institutional and market conditions; and\n            where participants can interact in a direct way and build on\n            related processes of community and municipal development;\n            participation works best when based on a systematic learning\n            process; the organizational structure and form (or forms) of\n            property in land and other assets should be determined by\n            the members of each enterprise who are themselves self\n            selected; access to high quality enterprise development\n            services is a critical factor that is mostly lacking in\n            rural areas; gender equality is both a means and an end of\n            enterprise development; institutional arrangements going\n            forward should ideally be constructed on the basis of local\n            alliances and give priority to local initiatives; the\n            institutional structure adopted for the long term should\n            build-in arrangements and designed to facilitate the\n            strongest possible forms of social auditing and control; and\n            it is possible to shift the ground of the land access debate\n            from a narrow, essentially political focus to a broader\n            focus on how to create viable livelihoods in the countryside."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Access to Land Pilot Project (PACTA)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Honduras - Access to Land Pilot\n            Project
