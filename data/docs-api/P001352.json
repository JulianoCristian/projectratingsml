The request was submitted by the\n            friends of Nairobi National Park (FoNNP). The request states\n            that an export processing zone (EPZ) 'located in Athi\n            River, Nairobi, Kenya, was funded by the World Bank sometime\n            in 1994' without any stakeholder consultation. It\n            alleges that this EPZ contributed to the creation of\n            environmental and social conflicts, depleted water\n            resources, led to irregular electricity supply and abandoned\n            manufacturing operations. It further claims that 'the\n            EPZ lies waste after crippling and helping to destroy the\n            Kitengela wildlife ecosystem' and that 'local\n            communities are becoming increasingly hostile over\n            government plans to urbanize marginal lands'. Under the\n            eligibility criteria, the panel may not investigate projects\n            for which the loan has been closed or more than 95 percent\n            disbursed. Because the project closed on June 30, 1995, the\n            panel is not registering the request in the panel's\n            register, and is advising the Requester of this decision. In\n            making this determination, the panel notes the many\n            significant concerns stated by the Requesters and has\n            forwarded the request to management for its consideration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Export Development Project : notice\n            of receipt of a request for inspection and decision not to\n            register the request"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Export Development\n            Project : notice of receipt of a request for inspection and\n            decision not to register the request"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/08/11045816/kenya-export-development-project-notice-receipt-request-inspection-decision-not-register-request","projn":"KE-Export Development-114848 -- P001352","docty":"Inspection Panel Notice of Registration","subtopic":"Ecosystems and Natural Habitats,Livestock and Animal Husbandry,Wildlife Resources,E-Business,m","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Agriculture,Environment","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20090907041322"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise-IL,(Historic)Trade policy reform","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Agriculture,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"buffalo, conservation, ecosystem,\n            ecosystems, electricity, encroachment, Export Development,\n            Fenced, game, gazelles, grazing, harm, industrial\n            development, INSPECTION, Lake, lion, Livestock, Livestock\n            Research, loan, manufacturing, marginal lands, migration,\n            National Park, stakeholder, Telephone, wildlife, wildlife\n            areas, Wildlife Foundation"}},"owner":"WB Off: Nairobi - Eastern AFR 2 (AFCE2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"50254"},"733840":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1995/06/733840/kenya-export-development-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1995/06/733840/kenya-export-development-project","new_url":"1995/06/733840/kenya-export-development-project","disclosure_date":"2003-09-22T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1995/06/27/000009265_3961019134330/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1995/06/27/000009265_3961019134330/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","credit_no":"2197","docdt":"1995-06-27T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2003-09-23T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Export Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Export Development Project for Kenya\n            was satisfactory. The project achieved most of its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            modest, sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of\n            both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, the Kenyan\n            experience demonstrates the critical importance of\n            macroeconomic stability, particularly fiscal restraint, to\n            the success of export promotion. Second, private sector\n            confidence is also crucial for investment. However, the\n            Kenyan Government did not inspire such confidence because it\n            failed to follow a consistent set of macroeconomic and\n            financial policies compatible with the goal of trade\n            promotion. The Government's willingness and ability to\n            control the budget deficit and prevent further appreciation\n            of the exchange rate will be the keys to future investment\n            and export growth. Third, careful design contributed to the\n            ability of the KEAS component to focus on its very specific\n            goal, to provide support services to new and emerging\n            exporters. Reliance on private sector management ensured\n            that the scheme would not be used to further unrelated\n            Government objectives. The use of a cost-sharing arrangement\n            ensured that the beneficiary enterprises would share the\n            scheme's goals. Finally, the limited time frame for the\n            scheme prevented firms from becoming dependent on its support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Export Development

The\n            project achieved some of its objectives, institutional\n            development was negligible, sustainability is uncertain, and\n            the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was marginally\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, The EDP suffered significantly from high\n            turnover among task managers, resulting in inconsistent\n            supervision. It is clear that successive task managers were\n            unaware of the status of key components of the project and\n            unsure of what actions they should be taking to keep the\n            project on track. An established hand-over procedure,\n            including a detailed memo outlining the current status of\n            each element of the project and necessary future actions,\n            might mitigate this type of problem in the future. Second,\n            the experience with pre-shipment export finance in Kenya\n            should not be cause to reject similar programs elsewhere,\n            but should be viewed as an example of how an otherwise sound\n            program can be abused in the absence of adequate oversight\n            by both the Borrower and Bank. Finally, the GOK must\n            continue to improve the transparency and consistency of its\n            implementation of economic reform to achieve credibility in\n            the eyes of private
