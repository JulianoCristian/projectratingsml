Some lessons\n            learned included: risks associated with fluctuating exchange\n            rates should be hedged if a significant proportion of the\n            expenditures financed by the loan are in a currency\n            different from the loan currency. Procurement and\n            implementation arrangements for technically complex project\n            components should be carefully aligned with the real\n            capacity of the contractor and the implementing agency.\n            Close involvement of the implementing agency in project\n            design, together with attentiveness to their views, helps to\n            build a cooperative relationship between the Bank and the\n            Borrower. Continuity of Bank and Borrower personnel helps to\n            create mutual respect and understanding which in turn\n            facilitates resolution of problems that arise during the\n            course of implementation. Transferring slow-moving\n            components to other projects with the same Borrower should\n            be considered in order to avoid prolonging project closure,\n            particularly in instances where project development\n            objectives (PDOs) are similar and additional financing is\n            not a viable option."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan - Electricity

 quality of electricity supply; develop competition; and\n            restructure the Kazakhstan Grid Operating Company so that it\n            is financially viable. The project has four main components.\n            The first refurbishes transmission substations, including\n            replacement of high voltage equipment at substations;\n            installs shunt reactors to compensate for reactive power;\n            replaces protective relaying, and supplies and installs\n            monitoring and control equipment at substations. The second\n            component modernizes the dispatch control system, including\n            supply and installation of a supervisory control and data\n            acquisition system at regional and national dispatch\n            centers; reinforces a telecommunications system; and\n            supplies and installs a commercial metering system. The\n            third component finances institutional development, which\n            includes installing a company-wide management information\n            system and corporate restructuring. The fourth component\n            provides technical assistance for procurement and project\n            management, and establishes an electricity spot market."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan -
