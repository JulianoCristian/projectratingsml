Under the\n            technical assistance component, studies will be undertaken\n            which will provide the basis for reorganization of the\n            sector and rehabilitation of its institutions (168\n            man-months). The technical assistance program will also\n            include training, operational support, and assistance in the\n            implementation of the rehabilitation plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Power System Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Power System\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/08/741644/ghana-power-system-rehabilitation-project","projn":"GH-Power-266580 -- P000868","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Poverty Alleviation,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Ghana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3971023104131"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to electricity,barrels of oil,barrels\n            per day,bulk electricity,bulk power,charcoal,coal,commercial\n            energy,cooking,covers,crude oil,cubic feet of gas,diesel\n            fuel,diesel power,diesel power plants,Distribution\n            losses,distribution of electricity,Distribution\n            Systems,electric power,Electricity,Electricity\n            Consumption,electricity sales,electricity\n            services,Electricity Supply,Energy demand,Energy Fund,energy\n            needs,energy policies,energy projects,Energy\n            Resources,ENERGY SECTOR,engineering,engineers,export\n            markets,final energy demand,fire,flexibility,fuelwood,gas\n            market,gas reserves,generating plant,grid,grid\n            extensions,high voltage,hydroelectric\n            plants,Income,Insurance,lignite,natural gas,oil,oil\n            companies,Oil Company,oil\n            equivalent,peat,Petroleum,petroleum exploration,petroleum\n            industry,petroleum product,Petroleum product\n            prices,petroleum products,pipeline,power generation,power\n            plants,Power Sector,power supplies,Power System,power\n            systems,primary energy,primary energy demand,proven\n            reserves,Recoverable reserves,Renewable Energy,reserves of\n            oil,rural electrification,solar energy,thermal\n            energy,thermal plants,total consumption,transmission\n            grid,transport,urban centers,utilities,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to electricity,barrels of oil,barrels\n            per day,bulk electricity,bulk power,charcoal,coal,commercial\n            energy,cooking,covers,crude oil,cubic feet of gas,diesel\n            fuel,diesel power,diesel power plants,Distribution\n            losses,distribution of electricity,Distribution\n            Systems,electric power,Electricity,Electricity\n            Consumption,electricity sales,electricity\n            services,Electricity Supply,Energy demand,Energy Fund,energy\n            needs,energy policies,energy projects,Energy\n            Resources,ENERGY SECTOR,engineering,engineers,export\n            markets,final energy demand,fire,flexibility,fuelwood,gas\n            market,gas reserves,generating plant,grid,grid\n            extensions,high voltage,hydroelectric\n            plants,Income,Insurance,lignite,natural gas,oil,oil\n            companies,Oil Company,oil\n            equivalent,peat,Petroleum,petroleum exploration,petroleum\n            industry,petroleum product,Petroleum product\n            prices,petroleum products,pipeline,power generation,power\n            plants,Power Sector,power supplies,Power System,power\n            systems,primary energy,primary energy demand,proven\n            reserves,Recoverable reserves,Renewable Energy,reserves of\n            oil,rural electrification,solar energy,thermal\n            energy,thermal plants,total consumption,transmission\n            grid,transport,urban centers,utilities,water supply"}},"owner":"WB Off: Accra Western AFR 1 (AFCW1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"4932"},"facets":{}}}
