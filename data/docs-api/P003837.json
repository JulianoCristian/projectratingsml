The project would\n            provide improved basic services to 1.2 million residents of\n            the four cities. About 760,000 would benefit from the\n            kampung improvement program.  Another 400,000 would share in\n            the benefits of the solid waste disposal program, which\n            would provide a cleaner physical environment and reduce\n            health risks, and the drainage improvement program, which\n            would minimize the risks of property damage, illness and\n            loss of life arising from periodic flooding."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Fifth Urban Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Fifth Urban\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1984/04/741653/indonesia-fifth-urban-development-project","projn":"ID-Urban V -- P003837","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"City Development Strategies,Municipal Financial Management,Urban Services to the Poor,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Urban Development","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980203114737"},"subsc":"(Historic)Urban management","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Urban Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Urban Development","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,Autonomy,basic\n            services,betterment tax,Cities,city development,City\n            Drainage,City Governments,drainage facilities,Economic\n            Analysis,employment,financial accounting,garbage\n            collection,Housing,housing development,Land Acquisition,land\n            development,land fill,land registration,Land Taxes,local\n            enterprises,local government,local\n            governments,migration,municipal administration,municipal\n            agencies,Municipal Development,Municipal\n            Governments,Municipal Management,neighborhoods,Project\n            Finance,property tax collection,Provincial\n            Governments,Provisions,Public Works,revenue\n            collection,roads,sanitary landfill,sanitation,sanitation\n            facilities,Savings,schools,septic tanks,service\n            standards,sewerage,social facilities,Solid Waste,solid waste\n            collection,solid waste disposal,Solid Waste\n            Management,Tax,tax revenues,taxation,Technical\n            Assistance,transport,urban areas,Urban Development,urban\n            drainage,Urban growth,urban infrastructure,urban\n            investments,urban population,urban population growth,urban\n            poverty,urban programs,urban projects,urban residents,URBAN\n            SECTOR,urban services,urban water supply,Urbanization,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,Autonomy,basic\n            services,betterment tax,Cities,city development,City\n            Drainage,City Governments,drainage facilities,Economic\n            Analysis,employment,financial accounting,garbage\n            collection,Housing,housing development,Land Acquisition,land\n            development,land fill,land registration,Land Taxes,local\n            enterprises,local government,local\n            governments,migration,municipal administration,municipal\n            agencies,Municipal Development,Municipal\n            Governments,Municipal Management,neighborhoods,Project\n            Finance,property tax collection,Provincial\n            Governments,Provisions,Public Works,revenue\n            collection,roads,sanitary landfill,sanitation,sanitation\n            facilities,Savings,schools,septic tanks,service\n            standards,sewerage,social facilities,Solid Waste,solid waste\n            collection,solid waste disposal,Solid Waste\n            Management,Tax,tax revenues,taxation,Technical\n            Assistance,transport,urban areas,Urban Development,urban\n            drainage,Urban growth,urban infrastructure,urban\n            investments,urban population,urban population growth,urban\n            poverty,urban programs,urban projects,urban residents,URBAN\n            SECTOR,urban services,urban water supply,Urbanization,Water Supply"}},"owner":"Indonesia Headquarters Unit (EACIQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"4887"},"facets":{}}}
