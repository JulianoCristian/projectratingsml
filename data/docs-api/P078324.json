Some lessons learned included: this project\n            underlined the large benefits that can be had from\n            investment in a well-functioning monitoring and evaluation\n            strategy. Factors that were important to the success of the\n            monitoring and evaluation strategy included closely support\n            by the Bank team on technical issues, clarity of the tasks\n            described in the ToRs (i.e. specified number of health\n            facility and household surveys), the fact that the request\n            for proposals was attractive to well-qualified institutions,\n            and effective management of the contract by Ministry of\n            Public Health (MOPH). Comparison with experience in other\n            countries also suggests the importance of the fact that the\n            contracted organization was a university whose primary\n            motivation was not profit. High quality staff from the ranks\n            of graduate students were deployed, the organization had a\n            large reputational stake in ensuring high quality according\n            to international best practice, it went beyond its terms of\n            reference to pursue deeper analysis (often with the\n            self-interested aim of producing peer-reviewed\n            publications), and it established an excellent working\n            relationship with MOPH by being highly responsive to\n            pressing requests for data collection and analyses. The\n            investment project paradigm is poorly adapted to supporting\n            the delivery of basic social services in countries such as\n            Afghanistan that require ongoing financing of recurrent\n            costs. Investment projects are basically designed to make\n            one-off investments that are intended to produce returns\n            after the end of the project. A number of features of the\n            Bank's traditional investment project framework stem\n            from this, such as short project implementation periods and\n            the difficulties in financing of civil servant remuneration\n            (on the assumption that the government should be able to\n            handle such recurrent costs after the investment is completed)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Health Sector Emergency\n            Rehabilitation and Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan - Health Sector\n

By the time the\n            Taliban regime fell in 2001, Afghanistan had some of the\n            world\u2019s worst health indicators. Afghanistan needed to\n            improve its primary health care delivery to decrease its\n            child and maternal mortality rates, particularly in rural\n            areas. Without a viable primary care system, the country was\n            also vulnerable to emergent diseases such as HIV and AIDS\n            and avian influenza that threatened public health.\n            International Development Association (IDA) along with local\n            and international Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)\n            financed the Health Sector Emergency Reconstruction and\n            Development Project which provided the basic package of\n            health services to the rural people. It also supported the\n            community midwifery education program. In addition volunteer\n            community health workers were trained, new health centers\n            opened, and the quality of care improved. To meet emergent\n            public health risks, IDA also financed the Afghanistan HIV\n            and AIDS Preventive project. It also built national capacity\n            to inform the public at large about how to avoid HIV\n            infection, strengthened surveillance of HIV incidence,\n            mapped and estimated the size of groups engaged in high-risk\n            behavior, and supported information and advocacy campaigns\n            to reduce the social stigma associated with the disease. IDA\n            also financed the Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic\n            Preparedness and Response Project to keep bird flu from\n            spreading to humans by developing and implementing Highly\n            Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) prevention and eradication\n            activities.
