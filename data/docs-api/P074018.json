Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) fund disbursement linked to\n            construction progress (for individual construction)\n            facilitates effective use of funds. In the absence of this\n            link, there is a risk that beneficiaries may use funds for\n            purposes other than the intended use; 2) the projects\n            approach to the reconstruction of housing are now standard\n            across South Asia disaster management housing reconstruction\n            programs and have influenced housing reconstruction in Aceh,\n            Indonesia. Lessons learnt from the project have been\n            integrated into those projects; 3) the Government of\n            Gujarat's (GoG's) 2003 promulgation of the Gujarat\n            Disaster Management Act, provided for the formation and\n            mandate of the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority\n            (GSDMA). The formation of the GSDMA allowed for quick policy\n            decisions during project implementation, for the\n            co-ordination of a multitude of line departments (without\n            questions of authority) and for the integration of\n            longer-term disaster management into the disaster\n            reconstruction. In the absence of the Act and the GSDMA\n            integrated disaster management would not have been possible;\n            and 4) disasters require quick reconstruction to meet the\n            needs of affected people.

There are four project\n            components. The first finances the implementation of\n            owner-driven housing recovery plans initiated under the\n            ongoing immediate phase (Phase 1) for the partially damaged\n            and fully collapsed houses in the affected rural and urban\n            areas. The second component funds for repairing,\n            strengthening, rehabilitating, reconstructing, and upgrading\n            damaged public buildings, roads and bridges, and dams and\n            irrigation infrastructure in the earthquake-affected areas;\n            2) retrofitting undamaged government administration\n            buildings and critically important public buildings and\n            preparing detailed engineering documents for retrofitting\n            key bridges; and 3) constructing buildings and control rooms\n            needed to foster State emergency management as well as\n            setting up the Gujarat Institute of Disaster Management\n            (GIDM) and the Institute for Seismic Research. The third\n            component ensures the participation of earthquake-affected\n            communities establishing village-level subcenters to build\n            capacity for earthquake-resistant construction,\n            strengthening local government mechanisms, gender\n            sensitization, and community-based disaster preparedness\n            programs.

An awareness campaign will be\n            conducted so that excavated materials at each site will be\n            managed properly, and storage/piling is done away from water\n            bodies and drainage channels.

No forestland, ecological\n            protected areas, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, or\n            known habitats of flora/fauna will be acquired for public\n            use, nor will environmental resources be overused as\n            building materials.
