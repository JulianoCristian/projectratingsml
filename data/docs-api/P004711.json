a program for the\n            resettlement of about 2,000 families living in the proposed\n            reservoir area; (b) construction of a rockfill storage dam\n            82 meters high with a total embankment volume of about 8\n            million cubic meters; (c) construction of an open-chute type\n            spillway; (d) an intake structure with one irrigation outlet\n            and three power conduits; (e) construction of a surface\n            powerhouse with three generating units of 100 MW each and of\n            a switchyard; (f) installation of a 230 kV double-circuit\n            transmission line about 88 km long from Khao Laem to\n            Srinagarind and a 230 kV single-circuit line on double\n            circuit towers, about 108 km long on to the Ban Pong No.
