Some lessons\n            learned included: take into account the small size of the\n            Lao PDR program and opportunity costs of the World Bank (WB)\n            team in pursuing an overambitious budget support operation.\n            In addition, every action or trigger should be accompanied\n            with technical assistance (TA) or other WB program in order\n            to achieve outcomes. The reform areas to which the\n            Government has not fully committed or that do not have\n            enough capacity or champions in the Government that are able\n            to lead reforms should not be included, while the dialog in\n            these areas should continue through other instruments, such\n            as analytical and advisory services (AAAs) and capacity\n            building activities. The emphasis should be shifted from\n            actions and triggers to outcomes and indicators, leading to\n            a more streamlined policy matrix of maximum 6 triggers and\n            12 actions. Relying on outcomes will also allow focusing on\n            achieving outcomes through a coherent and well-timed\n            program, rather than focusing on having an action in each\n            sub-sector every year. Triggers and actions should be worded\n            more flexibly and indicatively, to allow for adjustments\n            along the way that would lead to better outcomes rather than\n            fulfilling the matrix to the letter. The Government should\n            also get credit for reforms that lead to the outcomes, even\n            if these were not initially envisioned in the matrix."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao People's

that is consistent with the IMF Government\n            Finance Statistics; the development of quarterly budget\n            execution report formats; increasing the efficiency of\n            public procurement; strengthened monitoring of state owned\n            companies including commercial banks; and implementation of\n            further phases of the power sector action plan; Component 2,\n            Public expenditure policy reforms, will consolidate progress\n            in the timeliness o f payment of salaries to teachers and\n            health workers; further increases in the
