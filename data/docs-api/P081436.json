Some lessons learned included: an investment\n            loan dealing with slum upgrading should have an integrated\n            approach to social and physical urban interventions.\n            Assessing the importance of achieving gradual and small\n            scale improvements (such as providing new homes, improving\n            sanitation coverage, or increasing access to educational\n            facilities) can help in setting expectations for the project\n            as a whole, and later in assessing the project's impact\n            and its contribution to sustainable poverty reduction in a\n            targeted area. It is important to size the right project for\n            the right level of administration. Project preparation of an\n            investment loan should strike the right balance between\n            readiness to implement and flexibility in project design.\n            Bank engagement in urban and slum upgrading projects should\n            include work on housing policy and finance at local level.\n            Teams dealing with projects targeting at-risk and vulnerable\n            areas should carefully consider variables that may be\n            difficult to control. Sequencing in core activities linked\n            to slum upgrading projects can be the key to a successful\n            project implementation. Bank fiduciary approaches to project\n            supervision can be better integrated, harmonized, and\n            congruent to clients' capacities, in order to reduce\n            project management costs and facilitate day to day routine\n            supervision and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Bahia Poor Urban Areas Integrated\n            Development
