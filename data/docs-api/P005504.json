Despite consistency with government\n            priorities, and largely with the Country Assistance Strategy\n            objectives, major project risks, identified at the design\n            stages, but neglected further on, hampered the quality of\n            project implementation. Key lessons suggest that: 1) since\n            the Bank does not have a high comparative advantage in\n            funding technical assistance projects which are not\n            competitively prone, nor economically strong, aid agencies,\n            and grants available for environmental pilot activities\n            would be suited, in particular, for building environmental\n            capacity, and in general, for institutional projects. But,\n            where institutional development projects for new agencies\n            are undertaken by the Bank, the perceived importance of the\n            Bank advisory role may thrust the political will, and donor\n            coordination, essential for project success; 2) the design\n            for environmental management projects, should take into\n            account the socioeconomic context of the country, where top\n            management should ensure that environmental goals are met at\n            the highest level; and, 3) since legislation prepared under\n            projects is rarely enacted during the life of the project,\n            the Bank should find ways to continue support for adoption\n            of such legislation, to reach the final targets on which the\n            impact of the project depends."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Environmental Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Environmental\n
