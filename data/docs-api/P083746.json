Ratings for the Housing Sector Development\n            Policy Loan Project for Morocco are as follows: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            Algeria project include: seeding housing reform by focusing\n            upon a selected bottlenecks-such as in bank processing of\n            mortgage loans and in the registration of property titles\n            cannot guarantee that the reform will take root. Even if\n            they constitute necessary conditions for reform, they must\n            be calibrated with other actions to ease the supply of new\n            housing, for example-to achieve the well functioning markets\n            promised by the housing sector reform. Housing sector\n            reforms need to be calibrated and synchronized in order to\n            succeed. In Algeria, improving the origination and\n            processing of mortgage loans went ahead even though demand\n            for such loans was weak. In such cases, reform measures\n            might need to be scaled back or delayed. Lessons learned\n            from the Morocco Project include: policies and programs\n            aimed at achieving cities without slums need to treat slums\n            as a dynamic feature of urban development. Without\n            appropriate urban planning and land use controls, the\n            formation of new slums can overwhelm the achievements of\n            upgrading and redeveloping existing ones. For housing reform\n            to be sustained, it is important to modernize and\n            consolidate the institutional framework for taking the\n            reform forward through a powerful and financially sound\n            agency such as Al Omrane that enjoys full government\n            support. Sector reform is more likely to succeed if\n            harnessed to a flagship program that is well understood by\n            all stakeholders and beneficiaries, such as the Villes sans\n

Some lessons learned included: reforming land\n            titling was identified at the preparation stage as one of\n            the critical bottlenecks constraining the land supply for\n            residential purposes. This is still a major issue that\n            remains to be addressed. However, as land titling is not\n            specific to the housing sector, but rather cuts across all\n            areas of the national economy, it was not possible to\n            include its reform in the HSDPL and a separate operation\n            would be required. This issue will have to be addressed for\n            all aspects of land titling, such as in industrial,\n            agricultural, tourism, and residential housing sectors. It\n            is widely understood that current constraints in land tenure\n            and land titling constitute a hindrance to economic growth\n            across all sectors of the Moroccan economy. The high level\n            of financial resources and institutional support to the\n            social housing programs provided by the Government should be\n            accompanied by appropriate safeguard measures to ensure that\n            the intended benefits reach the targeted social groups and\n            are not captured by others, thus undermining the social\n            impacts of the public housing policies and the credibility\n            of the responsible institutions. The public policies in\n            support of the housing sector, and in particular the social\n            housing programs, are part of the Government's broader\n            approach towards poverty alleviation, which include\n            interventions in health, education, and social protection.\n            Insufficient targeting and leakages in the social housing\n            programs will weaken the pro-poor efforts of the Government\n            and undermine its credibility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Housing Sector Development Policy\n            Loan

Policy Loan for Morocco on June 30, 2005. The\n            loan agreement was signed on July 18, 2005 and declared\n            effective on August 24, 2005, when the front end fee of Euro\n            580,500 was applied. The first tranche was disbursed on\n            September 2, 2005. The loan's original closing date of\n            December 31, 2007 was extended by six months to June 30,\n            2008. The development objectives of the loan are to: (i)\n            strengthen the institutional, regulatory and fiscal\n            environment for a well-functioning housing market and for\n            the emergence of market-based solutions to the\n            country's housing sector constraints and needs; and\n            (ii) increase the access of low income and severely\n            disadvantaged households to more affordable and higher\n            quality housing. Three years after the approval of the loan,\n            the housing sector in Morocco has gone through profound\n            transformations and is now considered one of the most\n            dynamic sectors of the national economy. All indicators seem\n            to confirm that the policy implemented by the Government as\n            of early 2003, and which has been supported by the\n            Bank's technical assistance at first, and by the\n            present loan for the past three years, has been successful\n            in addressing some of the fundamental sector issues and in\n            reaching the above development objectives. This tranche\n            release document certifies that (i) the progress achieved by\n            the Borrower in the carrying out of the program of reforms\n            supported by the loan is satisfactory; (ii) the\n            macroeconomic framework of the Borrower is satisfactory, and\n            in line with the program, as measured on the basis of\n            indicators agreed upon between the Borrower and the Bank;\n            and (iii) the actions agreed upon for the disbursement of\n            the second tranche have been taken, with the exception of\n            one action, for which a waiver is sought."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Housing Sector Development Policy\n            Loan : release of the second tranche and request for one

       Government's housing sector program, and of the Housing\n            Sector Development Policy Loan Project are to strengthen the\n            institutional, regulatory, and fiscal environment for a\n            well-functioning housing market, and for the emergence of\n            market-based solutions to the country's housing sector\n            constraints and needs, in addition to increasing the access\n            of low-income, and severely disadvantaged households, to\n            more affordable and higher quality housing. The loan would\n            support the first objective through policy reforms and\n            measures to modernize urban planning standards and\n            regulations; restructure and refocus public sector housing\n            agencies, and enterprises; and, rationalize and simplify\n            real estate taxes and subsidies. The second objective would\n            be supported by reforms and measures to expand urban slum\n            upgrading, and social housing programs through\n            market-friendly approaches, will improve the efficiency of\n            the residential rental market, and, will expand the access\n            of informal sector and low-income households, to\n            market-based housing finance. However, identified risks\n            concern coordination among the institutions involved; the\n            pace of implementation of the slum upgrading program, and of\n            the Public Housing Operators (OPH) restructuring, and in\n            addition, the potential delays in the legislative reforms\n            for the urban planning code, residential rental sector and\n            real estate taxation, and subsidies, most importantly, the\n            absence of land titling reform. Despite these factors,\n            macroeconomic risks are found to be not critical to the\n            success of reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Housing Sector Development Policy\n            Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco -
