The paper\n            concerns best practice in land administration systems. While\n            the paper is focussed on world's best practice, it does\n            so in the context of developing and emerging industrial\n            countries such as Indonesia which have diverse land tenure\n            relationships ranging from areas in cities with active land\n            markets approaching modem land markets, to whole provinces\n            which are almost completely under traditional or customary\n            tenure. Each country has different requirements for\n            cadastral and land administration infrastructures due to\n            their specific social, legal, cultural, economic,\n            institutional and administrative circumstances. The paper\n            highlights some common principles in the design and\n            implementation of land administration infrastructures that\n            are usually applicable for countries such as Indonesia,\n            either now or in the foreseeable future. Not all principles\n            will be applicable for all countries. The paper discusses\n            the principles under the following headings: 1) land policy\n            principles, 2) land tenure principles, 3) land\n            administration and cadastral principles, 4) institutional\n            principles, 5) spatial data infrastructure principles, 6)\n            technical principles, 7) human resource development\n            principles. The paper concludes by highlighting the\n            importance of developing a vision for a land administration\n            system within each country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Best practices for land administration\n            systems in developing countries"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Best practices for land\n            administration systems in developing countries"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2000/07/18634306/best-practices-land-administration-systems-developing-countries","count":"Indonesia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Economic & Sector Work","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural lands, agricultural\n            productivity, Agriculture, cities, common property,\n            compensation, economic development, environments, forest,\n            forest lands, forestry, forests, Habitat, housing, LAND\n            ADMINISTRATION, land information systems, land law, Land\n            Management, land market, land markets, land owner, land\n            owners, land parcels, LAND POLICY, land records, land\n            reform, land registration, land rights, land tenure, land\n            tenures, land title, land titles, land titling, land\n            transfer, land use, Land Use Policy, land valuation, lands,\n            natural resources, Oil, private lands, property\n            administration, property rights, resource management, rural\n            areas, squatter, squatter settlements, tenures, urban areas, villages"}},"majtheme":"Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Rule of law","projn":"ID-- Land Administration -- P003984","docty":"Other Infrastructure Study","subtopic":"Rural Land Policies for Poverty Reduction,Common Property Resource Development,Land Use and Policies,Urban Housing,Forestry","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Urban Development,Rural Development","authors":{"authr":"Williamson, Ian P."},"entityids":{"entityid":"000456286_20131211122618"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Central government administration","theme":"Land administration and management,Rural markets,Personal and property rights","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Urban Development,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Social, Env. & Rural Sus.
