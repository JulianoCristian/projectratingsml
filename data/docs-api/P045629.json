The Sihanoukville\n            Water Supply Authority (SWSA) became more autonomous in its\n            operations and extended water supply services to 18,000\n            people within its poor service area. By 2004, both utilities\n            improved their operational and financial performance\n            substantially. The project also assisted in developing a\n            national water supply and sanitation policy to foster\n            sustainable well performing and autonomous public utilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rehabilitating the urban water sector in Cambodia"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rehabilitating the urban water\n            sector in Cambodia"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/03/16583541/rehabilitating-urban-water-sector-cambodia","projn":"KH-Provincial And Peri-Urban Water And\n            Sanitation Project -- P073311,KH-Urban Water Supply Project -- P045629","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Urban Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Cambodia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20120808004258"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sanitation,Water supply","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","colti":"Water feature stories ; issue no. 6","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to water, access to water supply,\n            ALTERNATIVE APPROACH, capacity building, Collection\n            efficiency, cost recovery, distribution system, domestic\n            connections, effective urban water supply, leakage, local\n            communities, national water, national water supply, number\n            of connections, piped water, Private operators, public\n            utilities, rehabilitation of infrastructure, sanitation\n            access, sanitation investments, sanitation policy,\n            Sanitation Sector, sanitation services, service area,\n            service providers, towns, urban communities, Urban\n            Sanitation, Urban Water, Urban Water Sector, Urban Water\n            Supply, water connections, Water quality, Water sales, Water\n            Sector, water services, water supply services, water supply\n            systems, water utilities"}},"owner":"Water Unit (TWIWA),Southeast Asia Sustainable Dev (EASTS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF033708-CAMBODIA - URBAN WATER SUPPLY,TF033726-CAMBODIA - URBAN WATER SUPPLY,TF033737-ASIA REGION - WATER SUPPLY,TF033899-EAST ASIA - MEKONG BASIN,TF034089-CAMBODIA - WATER SUPPLY\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF035101-ASIA REGION - WATER, SEWERAGE SECTOR,TF035250-EAST ASIA REGION - MEKONG BASIN FINANCING,TF039272-CAMBODIA - URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT,TF024014-BNPP-WATER/RES/MNGT: WATER\n            SECTOR INITIATIVES 2000,TF026848-PHRD-CAMBODIA: PROVINCIAL AND\n            PERI-URBAN WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PR,TF038835-CAMBODIA - PROVINCIAL AND\n            PERIURBAN W&S PROJECT,TF040814-CAMBODIA: PROVINCIAL AND\n            PERI-URBAN WS PROJECT,TF050943-JSDF-CAMBODIA: CAPACITY\n            BUILDING AND BASIC SERVICE PROVISIONING IN CAMB,TF051613-JSDF-CAMBODIA: CAPACITY\n            BUILDING & BASIC SERVICE PROVISIONING IN CAMBOD","repnb":"46191"},"5591847":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/01/5591847/cambodia-urban-water-supply-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/01/5591847/cambodia-urban-water-supply-project","new_url":"2004/01/5591847/cambodia-urban-water-supply-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/02/09/000009486_20050209091721/Rendered/INDEX/30003.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/02/09/000009486_20050209091721/Rendered/PDF/30003.pdf","credit_no":"3041","datestored":"2005-02-09T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2004-01-21T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Urban Water Supply Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Urban Water Supply Project for\n            Cambodia had the following ratings:  the outcome was highly\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was highly likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, the Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory and borrower performance\n            was satisfactory.  Among the lessons learned are the\n            following:  1) More efforts should have been expended at\n            preparation to identify a solution to Sihanoukville Water\n            Supply Authority's (SWSA's) lack of autonomy. The\n            Bank may have erred in repeatedly requesting autonomy\n            without exploring other more realistic avenues, such as\n            simple management contracts. 2) Disappointed by the small\n            amount of flexibility enjoyed by SWSA, during the\n            preparation of the successor project in 2000 the Bank\n            decided not to include in the latter urban water systems\n            without sufficient autonomy, and therefore to discontinue\n            its involvement in Sihanoukville. In hindsight, the\n            Bank's exit was probably premature and, as\n            implementation progressed after 2000, it became increasingly\n            clear that this had been a mistake. 3) Phnom Penh Water\n            Supply Authority's (PPWSA' s) leadership was to a\n            very large extent the driving force behind the whole\n            project, as it created a dynamic benefiting all\n            stakeholders. It also had a powerful demonstration effect.\n            4) Project implementation would have benefited, if, before\n            start of project execution, key personnel from the central\n            and technical ministries had been provided assistance and\n            training in Bank policies and procedures. It would have\n            reduced delays. To the extent possible, this type of\n            assistance should be on a grant basis. 5) The experiences\n            accumulated from the project plead for a continued\n            Bank's presence in the water and sanitation sector in\n            Cambodia to consolidate what was achieved and to expand much\n            needed services to a very poor population."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia -

The project consists of three\n            components: 1) Augmentation of water supply in Phnom Penh\n            will be done through rehabilitation and extension of the\n            Chruoy Chang War water treatment plant; supply of pipes,\n            ancillary equipment and leak detection equipment; and\n            technical assistance.  2) Augmentation of water supply in\n            Sihanoukville will be done by raising the outlet weir and\n            sealing off the sand spit to increase the storage of raw\n            water; constructing four new groundwater wells; and\n            improving distribution system.  3) Assistance to develop a\n            water and sanitary policy framework for the sector as a\n            whole will be provided through financing of consulting services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Urban Water Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cambodia - Urban Water Supply
