The project\n            consists of three components. First, the local institutions\n            strengthening component will support the Local\n            Administration and Line Ministries at the governorate,\n            district, and village levels in assisting local communities\n            to identify, plan, operate, and maintain rural\n            infrastructure through training and technical assistance.\n            Second, the village infrastructure component will support\n            Village Priority Development Plans identified, prepared, and\n            co-financed through the SHROUK participatory process. It\n            will provide grant financing to support community-based\n            social and economic infrastructure sub-projects such as\n            village water supply systems, rural roads, health centers,\n            women's clubs, etc. Third, the rural finance component\n            will promote increased economic activities and open access\n            to credit for women and the rural poor in Sohag. It will\n            also support on-farm technology improvement and rural-based\n            investment. The component will also finance a special\n            wholesale credit window for nongovernmental organizations\n            and provide institutional support to the Local Development
