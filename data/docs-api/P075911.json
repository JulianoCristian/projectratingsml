Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) improved accountability system for\n            community development is critical in order to enhance\n            positive perceptions among beneficiaries, and other\n            stakeholders including donors. This provides an incentive\n            for their support and involvement. For this to be achieved\n            there is need to strengthen the information, education and\n            communication (IEC) so as to enhance civic engagement and\n            community accountability. 2) The first adaptable program\n            loan (APL 1) has managed to put in place proper\n            accountability systems; through the APL 1, several\n            innovations were made with regard to results monitoring and\n            measurement. Such systems need to be maintained at each\n            level of project implementation. For example, at the\n            community level, there is need to promote the use of\n            community monitoring and feedback through the community\n            statistics days as an integral part of the monitoring and\n            evaluation framework. At the local authority (LA) and\n            program level, there is need to promote participatory\n            development of delivery benchmarks related to the community\n            sub-project cycle so that beneficiaries and stakeholders are\n            aware of what they have to be accountable; and 3) the\n            sustainable mechanisms to secure continuity and\n            functionality of community assets and institutions\n            established through the APL 1 and other similar\n            interventions are important achievements for this project,\n            and need to be institutionalized."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Third Social Action Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi - Third Social Action Fund

- Third Social Action Fund Project (APL)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Under The Third Social Action Fund\n            Project (APL) (MASAF 3) for Malawi, the distributed nodes of\n            social capital generated through MASAF I and I1 will be\n            networked to both optimize the social capital generated as\n            well as to facilitate i t s incremental conversion into\n            economic capital. There are five project components. The\n            first component, Community Development Projects combines two\n            of the current components under MASAF 11, Community\n            Sub-projects and Public Works Program, for effective\n            integration into the local authority (LA)  management\n            framework. It will continue to finance demand-driven\n            community-based socio-economic activities, including\n            infrastructure, which include inter alias: construction\n            and/or rehabilitation related to the provision of basic\n            social services in health, education and water;\n            afforestation, terracing, community roads and bridges,\n            community centers, food processing technologies, energy\n            efficiency interventions, training, and others. The Social\n            Support Projects stimulates and supports traditional coping\n            systems which rely on the extended family to mitigate\n            against foster households experiencing deepening poverty\n            after taking in vulnerable individuals. The vulnerable\n            include: widows and widowers, the aged, orphans and foster\n            parents, the destitute, the disabled, persons affected by\n            HIVIAIDS, and malnourished under-fives. The project will\n            finance initiatives identified by communities working with\n            NGOs/CBOs, and these projects will contribute to household\n            food and nutrition security for the vulnerable individuals\n            and foster households. The component will assist in the\n            development of long-term capacity and provide technical\n            assistance to NGOs/CBOs working directly with the vulnerable\n            groups at the district, ward, and village levels. The third\n            component, Community Savings and Investment Promotion\n            (COMSIP) will, given the few formal opportunities for saving\n            that exist, promote a savings and investment culture among\n            the poor. Support under this component will not include the\n            transfer of monies for savings or credit purposes, but will\n            include promotion of COMSIGs of 10-15 members each. The\n            fourth component, Transparency and Accountability Promotion,\n            will develop suitable technical guidelines, generate data\n            from the work of communities and partner institutions,\n            process such data into useful information, disseminate, and\n            package it into suitable materials for training. This\n            component will also focus on developing an effective MIS\n            which will feed into the overall monitoring and evaluation\n            system. The fifth component, the Institutional Development\n            component, will address the internal capacity requirements\n            of MASAF to deliver in a transparent and accountable way. It\n            will finance the continued provision of technically\n            competent staff to work at the MASAF MU, and strengthen LA\n            capacity to implement the community sub-project cycle with\n            technical and financial expertise."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Third Social Action Fund Project (APL)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi - Third Social Action Fund\n
