Some lessons learned\n            included: the concept of quality of education is a dynamic\n            concept that evolves over time. The evolution and\n            development of education quality should be defined and\n            formed to respond to a specific country or socio-economic\n            and cultural context at a certain period of time. Therefore,\n            setting up a Fundamental School Quality Level (FSQL) that\n            matches the education system's implementation and\n            financial capacity was critical to ensure its relevance and\n            usefulness. The project was designed as a traditional\n            investment project, providing incremental finance to a\n            project with specific time-bound objectives that were\n            expected to be achieved in targeted districts by completion.\n            Its institutional arrangements were designed to facilitate\n            and ensure the project's effective implementation, but\n            institutional strengthening on a national scale over and\n            above that which will be required for successful\n            implementation was not an explicit objective of the Project\n

to have\n            regularly demonstrated strengthened capacity to identify,\n            plan for, support and monitor the needs of educationally\n            disadvantage

Disadvantaged children are\n            broadly defined as school-aged children who are not enrolled\n            or are at-risk of not completing their primary education;\n            children who attend schools thatdo not meet fundamental\n            quality standards; and disabled children or children from\n            other highly vulnerable groups, such as street children,\n            migrant children, or girls in certain ethnic minority areas.\n            There are three project components beside the project\n            management component. The first component raises all schools\n            in the 189 most disadvantaged targeted districts to a\n            fundamental school quality level (FSQL) through a\n            two-pronged approach: 1) it provides necessary support to\n            district administration to improve planning, management, and\n            monitoring capabilities; and 2) it enhances school capacity\n            to provide effective instruction at poorly resourced\n            satellite campuses. Specifically, the component strengthens\n            district school data collection systems; supports the\n            development of a district-wide FSQL action plan; procures a\n            teacher's guide, materials, and training modules;\n            provides workshops; places teacher assistants; upgrades\n            infrastructure; and strengthens parents' associations,\n            among other activities. The second component prsents\n            interventions that address the educational needs of disabled\n            children; and addresses the educational needs of vulnerable\n            groups, such as street and working children, children living\n            in fishing communities, and others. The third component\n            assists the Ministry of Education and Training (MoET) to lay\n            down a pathway for reaching national school standards by\n            using FSQL as a first step. It will propose FSQL criteria\n            and raise awareness at all levels of the education system\n            about how to bring every school up to FSQL levels."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam -

Disadvantaged Children Project\n            identifies ethnic minority issues, summarized as\n            difficulties in accessing education due to long distances,\n            or late enrollments; persistent incomplete schooling due to\n            high costs, or non-supportive environment to attend school,\n            namely, sibling care in ethnic minority areas, or child\n            labor

  Through project interventions, this IPP stipulates measures\n            to involve ethnic minorities in attending schools, and\n            participating in the educational achievements. Community\n            mobilization will prod school attendance, and foster\n            community training to improve school enrollment at the\n            district level, by supporting the provision of free\n            textbooks and supplies, supporting Vietnamese language\n            readiness programs, and improving training of local\n            teachers, in addition to quality improvements at satellite\n            schools, which should result in enhanced educational quality\n            between main campuses and satellite schools. Direct\n            educational costs should be alleviated through fee waivers\n            for books, and supplies, as well as community-supported\n            language-readiness pre-schooling should ease the burden of\n            sibling care, or child labor difficulties. Finally, the\n            national curriculum standards should be evenly applied, but\n            be relevant, and culturally appropriate to ethnic\n            minorities, in accord with educational
