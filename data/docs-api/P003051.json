In\n            particular, the project would: (a) strengthen education\n            planning by introducing a program of systematic data\n            collection and analysis, and a pilot program of school\n            mapping; (b) improve the relevance and quality of education\n            by conducting a survey of technical schools, preparing\n            programs to upgrade technical teachers, and assessing new\n            methods of textbook production, distribution and cost\n            recovery. Further, it would strengthen education management\n            and administration by carrying out an in-depth analysis of\n            the administrative structure and procedures of DEPS;\n            developing a plan for DEPS reorganization; training DEPS\n            staff, school principals and inspectors in budgeting,\n            accounting and management; and providing better\n            communication and transportation equipment. The project\n            would finance about 37 man-years of experts' services;\n            14 man-years of overseas fellowship training; in-country\n            training for about 2,800 Zairians; and miscellaneous\n            equipment, supplies and materials (including materials for\n            printing and distribution of textbooks)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire - Education Technical Assistance and\n            Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zaire - Education Technical\n            Assistance and Training Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1984/08/722830/zaire-education-technical-assistance-training-project","projn":"ZR-Educ.Trg.Tas -- P003051","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Teaching and Learning,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101902441068"},"subsc":"Primary education","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,administrative\n            costs,autonomy,banking system,class sizes,commercial\n            banks,commercial\n            debt,curricula,curriculum,debt,decentralization,decision\n            making,developing countries,education programs,education\n            projects,Education Quality,education sector,education\n            services,education statistics,education system,Educational\n            Quality,employment,enrollment,enrollment ratio,financial\n            management,financial resources,first grade,Fiscal\n            Year,foreign exchange,gross enrollment,gross enrollment\n            ratios,inflation,insurance,interest rates,lifting,local\n            government,local level,marketing,maturities,Ministries of\n            Finance,operating costs,operating expenditures,operating\n            expenses,parents,parity,penalties,poor performance,primary\n            school,primary school teachers,primary\n            teachers,principals,printing,private banks,private\n            sector,public debt,public enterprises,public\n            sector,pupils,qualified teachers,quality of\n            education,reorganization,school construction,school\n            inspection,School Supplies,schools,Secondary\n            Education,secondary level,secondary schools,Teacher,teacher\n            trainees,teacher training,teacher training\n            programs,teachers,teaching,teaching personnel,teaching\n            profession,teaching staff,Technical Assistance,Technical\n            Education,textbook production,textbooks,transport,urban\n            areas,Urbanization,Vocational Training,wages,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,administrative\n            costs,autonomy,banking system,class sizes,commercial\n            banks,commercial\n            debt,curricula,curriculum,debt,decentralization,decision\n            making,developing countries,education programs,education\n            projects,Education Quality,education sector,education\n            services,education statistics,education system,Educational\n            Quality,employment,enrollment,enrollment ratio,financial\n            management,financial resources,first grade,Fiscal\n            Year,foreign exchange,gross enrollment,gross enrollment\n            ratios,inflation,insurance,interest rates,lifting,local\n            government,local level,marketing,maturities,Ministries of\n            Finance,operating costs,operating expenditures,operating\n            expenses,parents,parity,penalties,poor performance,primary\n            school,primary school teachers,primary\n            teachers,principals,printing,private banks,private\n            sector,public debt,public enterprises,public\n            sector,pupils,qualified teachers,quality of\n            education,reorganization,school construction,school\n            inspection,School Supplies,schools,Secondary\n            Education,secondary level,secondary schools,Teacher,teacher\n            trainees,teacher training,teacher training\n            programs,teachers,teaching,teaching personnel,teaching\n            profession,teaching staff,Technical Assistance,Technical\n            Education,textbook production,textbooks,transport,urban\n            areas,Urbanization,Vocational Training,wages,water supply"}},"owner":"WBOff:Kinshasa-CC2:DRC/CG(Braz) (AFCC2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"P3766"},"facets":{}}}
