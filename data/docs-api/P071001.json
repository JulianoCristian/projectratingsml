Some lessons learned included: in high risk\n            environments (post crisis, fragmented governance, etc.) an\n            early wins strategy may be required, but should be\n            accompanied by flexibility, early and structured review, and\n            an exit strategy in the event that reforms come off track.\n            Formulation of laws in adjustment operations needs to be\n            accompanied by careful attention to addressing\n            implementation constraints, particularly in post-crisis or\n            transition environments, where capacity is particularly weak\n            and the institutional framework is fragmented. Operations\n            that require intensive on-the-ground capacity building are\n            not suitable for pure adjustment-type lending because the\n            adjustment timetable is usually inconsistent with the\n            capacity building timetable. In situations with multiple\n            development partners and significant capacity constraints,\n            effective leadership and coordination, both in government\n            and development partners, is essential."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

Some lessons learned included: collectively,\n            Bank staff and management should be realistic and\n            conservative in project design when the overall political\n            environment is unstable and coalitions are weak and easily\n            divided.

The Bank's\n            operational policies should be flexible and permit the use\n            of Development Policy Lending (DPL) of longer time and\n            duration, when justified, to adjust to local conditions and\n            allow sufficient implementation time to build up\n            institutional capacity and sustainability.

The Bank\n            should continue to have a unifying role, both with domestic\n            counterparts and international donors.

private sector growth.\n            Objectives of the reform program are to reduce those\n            administrative and regulatory barriers that will have the\n            most critical near-term impact on the three phases of\n            business development: 1) improving business entry through\n            streamlined and transparent countrywide approach to business\n            registration and licensing and strengthened legal framework\n            and capacity for attracting foreign investment; 2)\n            streamlining the environment for business operation by\n            reducing companies' administrative and regulatory\n            compliance costs through rationalization of inspections and\n            regulations, strengthening of judicial and extra-judicial\n            capacity to resolve commercial disputes; improving\n            enforcement of secured transactions; and leveling the\n            playing field for private sector participation in public\n            procurement; and 3) facilitating business exit through\n            improved bankruptcy and liquidation systems. Underlying\n            these objectives is the need to strengthen the consultative\n            capacity between the public and private sectors to promote\n            policies and legislation that are business-friendly. The\n            Credit will be released in two tranches for budgetary and\n            balance of payments support to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n            Tranche releases will be linked to policy
