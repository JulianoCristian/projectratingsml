Among\n            the lessons cited were the following: 1) Developing and\n            implementing a social development agenda for vulnerable\n            children is a multi-stakeholder responsibility that is\n            shared by central ministries and regional authorities as\n            well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and\n            communities. 2) NGOs are sound mechanisms for delivery of\n            services to vulnerable children; service delivery is made\n            more effective through a shift from a \"grant\"\n            approach to a \"contracting\" approach.  3) A strong\n            but simple monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system is\n            essential for learning and accountability. It should be\n            established at the onset of a project and include\n            measurement of costs, the intervention delivered,\n            stakeholder and beneficiary consultation, outputs and\n            outcomes expected. 4) 4. A learning and innovation lending\n            instrument (LIL) is effective to pilot and test initiatives,\n            and to build consensus around new approaches prior to large\n            scale interventions. 5) In the case of \"fast\n            track\" projects, project preparation work can continue\n            until project effectiveness. This is particularly\n            appropriate for a LIL which is processed in a short period\n            of time. 6) Field-based management is particularly effective\n            for this kind of pilot project that requires quick response\n            and support to unforeseen needs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt -
