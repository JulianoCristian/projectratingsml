Ratings for\n            the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Poverty Reduction Credit\n            Project for Burkina Faso are as follows: outcomes of the\n            project were satisfactory, sustainability is moderate, and\n            the performance of the Bank and the Borrower was also rated\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned from the report are: 1)\n            PRSCs are useful instruments to help the borrower assume\n            increased responsibility in managing its public resources in\n            an efficient manner, notably by providing more flexibility\n            and predictability; however, there is a risk of complacency\n            and of dependence on continued foreign budget support; 2)\n            issues of attribution are inevitable when the reform\n            programs are supported by several donors; 3) since outcomes\n            are to be assessed after several years, the quality of the\n            relevant statistical data is critical; if insufficient,\n            preparation should include remedial actions, including the\n            selection and definition of baseline data; 4) since reforms\n            are of medium-to long-term nature, early identification of\n            institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints is of\n            paramount importance; and 5) to assess outcome of a\n            medium-term program, it is essential that the different\n            documents of a PRSC series be consistent in content and\n            format,

      Assistance Strategy (CAS), to support the implementation of\n            the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), and, the second\n            in a series of three planned operations for FY02-03. The\n            project is designed to help the Government achieve better\n            outcomes in public resource management by: 1) strengthening\n            program budgets, linking allocations to specific sector\n            objectives, strategies, and action plans; 2) improving\n            service delivery in education, health, and rural\n            development; and, 3) strengthening the fiduciary framework,\n            to promote accountability, and transparency in the use of\n            public funds, including external aid. Nonetheless, the main\n            risks to this operation, and its reform program, come from\n            political instability, vested interests, and fiduciary and\n            institutional issues. However, to minimize those risks,\n            reforms are being implemented in a sensitive context, and in\n            participation with opposition parties in the political\n            dialogue; and, notwithstanding vested interests, and\n            fiduciary risks regarding the use of public funds, such\n            should be mitigated to a substantial extent by the design,\n            and content of the project, given that the supported, main\n            reform measures, will have been taken prior to Board\n            presentation, and, by the fact that substantial technical\n            support will be provided."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Second Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Second Poverty\n
