Some lessons learned included: the highly\n            streamlined project design proved to be a valuable\n            instrument and provided the right amount of flexibility in\n            project implementation that was the key for the success of\n            the pro-vicinais program for a sophisticated client with\n            important needs. The sufficient lead-time and resources for\n            consensus building and prioritization of the policy goals\n            was a key to successfully introducing new management systems\n            involving very complex procedural changes. The\n            sustainability of the rural road asset can be enhanced\n            through more active engagement of the project in assisting\n            clients in supporting local governments. Standardized\n            engineering designs with a classification of different\n            levels of maintenance interventions based on simple road\n            parameters are an important
