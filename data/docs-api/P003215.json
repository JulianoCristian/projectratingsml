thereby help sustain the\n            momentum of the policy and institutional reforms. This will\n            allow the productive sectors of the economy to respond to\n            the incentives and favorable economic environment\n            established by the reforms and provide the increased supply\n            of goods and services needed to support structural change in\n            the economy. The Credit will finance: a) imports of goods\n            with the exception of defense and luxury consumer goods, and\n            b) technical assistance and training. The latter component\n            will improve foreign exchange management by the Bank of\n            Zambia, audit implementation of Zambia Consolidated Copper\n            Mines' 5-year Production and Investment Plan, improve\n            debt management in the Ministry of Finance, and devise a\n            mechanism for limiting maize subsidies to low income\n            families. By increasing domestic supplies of spare parts,\n            raw materials, intermediate goods and other productive\n            inputs, as well as basic consumption goods, the project\n
