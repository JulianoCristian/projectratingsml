Due to a deterioration of organizational\n            structures in the state and collective farms, a large\n            reduction in subsidies, and shifts in relative prices for\n            outputs and inputs, agricultural production declined\n            significantly. The rapidly deteriorating irrigation and\n            drainage systems further reduced agricultural output.\n            Despite the complex situation, irrigated agriculture,\n            together with livestock, continued in the 1990s to be a\n            major component in the Kyrgyz Republic's economy,\n            accounting for 45 percent of GDP on average as well as 43\n            percent of employment. The next step was to rehabilitate and\n            modernize on-farm irrigation infrastructure within the\n            former large farms so that the supplied water could be used\n            more efficiently. To ensure adequate maintenance afterwards,\n            the government sought to promote the development and\n            strengthening of water users associations (WUAs) as the\n            critical organization responsible for on-farm irrigation\n            operation and maintenance. Support to the government to\n            address these sector issues was provided under the On-Farm\n            Irrigation Project (Project I), and is being continued under\n            the Second On-Farm Irrigation Project (Project II)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Water user associations as an essential\n            component of irrigation reform : Kyrgyz Republic's\n            first and second on-farm irrigation projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Water user associations as an\n            essential component of irrigation reform : Kyrgyz\n            Republic's first and second on-farm irrigation projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2008/10/11269499/water-user-associations-essential-component-irrigation-reform-kyrgyz-republics-first-second-on-farm-irrigation-projects","projn":"1W-Feature Stories -- P111132,KG-On-Farm Irrigation Project -- P049723,KG-Second On-Farm Irrigation Project -- P096409","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Irrigation and Drainage,Regional Economic Development,Water Supply and Systems,Water Use","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Kyrgyz Republic,World","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20091028000212"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia,The World Region,The World Region","colti":"Water feature stories ; issue no. 19","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA,Knowledge Management Product","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative regions, agricultural output,\n            agricultural production, agricultural sector, collective\n            farms, covering, crop production, drainage, drainage\n            systems, Farm Irrigation, farm systems, farmers, Human\n            Development, Human Development Index, irrigated agriculture,\n            irrigated land, Irrigation, irrigation fees, irrigation\n            infrastructure, Irrigation Project, Irrigation Projects,\n            irrigation rehabilitation, irrigation service, irrigation\n            systems, irrigation water, Life expectancy, poverty line,\n            rural livelihoods, Water delivery, water demands, water\n            distribution, Water Sector, Water User, Water User\n            Associations, water users, water users associations, WUA"}},"owner":"Urban Development Sector Unit (EASUR),Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD),Agriculture & Rural Development (ECSAR),Water Unit (TWIWA)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF025148-PHRD- ON-FARM IRRIGATION PROJECT,TF034356-ECA REGION -
