The original project parameters were revised, with\n            changes in the main beneficiaries, project components,\n            additional financing and an extension of the closing date of\n            the project. The outcomes of the HRP led to the realization\n            that lump-sum contracts were a success, leading to much\n            lower overall construction completion costs when compared to\n            traditional item-rate contracts. The HRP experience showed\n            that addressing sector policy reforms in investment\n            operations is a rather difficult undertaking. It also\n            highlighted the inadequacy of the price adjustment\n            mechanism, and construction industry constraints."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Highways Rehabilitation
