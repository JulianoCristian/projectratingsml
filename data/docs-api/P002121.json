The project significantly contributed to\n            establishing an institutional capacity to identify and\n            develop environmental policies and programs at the federal\n            and state levels. The project funded and guided the creation\n            of a monitoring network for data gathering and dissemination\n            of detailed information. During the project's life, an\n            enormous amount of work was done to develop dialogue and\n            linkages with a wide range of government and community\n            representatives, significantly raising public awareness and\n            understanding of environmental problems. Also, the large\n            numbers of staff trained by the project in the various\n            agencies should continue to have an impact on national\n            policies and programs. A central lesson learned is the\n            overarching importance in a complex technical assistance\n            project for effective management and close supervision at\n            the field level. The decisions required to move ahead with\n            project activities needed to be more decentralized from the\n            outset to give the project units within each agency more\n            authority for procuring goods and services. The World Bank\n            should have had substantial resources in the Resident\n            Mission from the initial stages to provide adequate ongoing\n            supervision and support to move with the project as it\n            developed, and to ensure agency coordination. The\n            project's planned implementation period was too\n            short--although the project closing date was later extended."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Environmental Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Environmental\n            Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/01/728070/nigeria-environmental-management-project","projn":"NG-Environmental Manage -- P002121","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Environmental Governance,ICT Policy and Strategies,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99031910572780"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,Agriculture,air,air\n            quality,climate,Conservation,contractors,data\n            collection,data gathering,decision-making,drainage,economic\n            conditions,economic development,environmental\n            agencies,environmental damage,environmental\n            degradation,environmental groups,Environmental\n            Impact,Environmental Impact Assessment,environmental impact\n            assessments,environmental issues,Environmental\n            Management,Environmental Management Project,environmental\n            organizations,environmental policies,environmental\n            priorities,environmental problems,Environmental\n            Protection,Environmental Protection\n            Agency,equipment,expenditures,extension,fisheries,forest\n            management,Forestry,hazardous waste,Housing,impact\n            assessments,implementing agencies,incentive\n            systems,industrial pollution,institutional capacity,land\n            degradation,Land Resources,land use,laws,national\n            level,natural resource,natural resource management,Natural\n            Resources,NGOs,ozone,pilot projects,pollution,population\n            growth,programs,public awareness,recycling,resource\n            use,rural communities,Rural Development,socioeconomic\n            data,soil degradation,soils,technical\n            assistance,television,timber,universities,waste,waste\n            management,water contamination,Water Resources,wetlands"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,Agriculture,air,air\n            quality,climate,Conservation,contractors,data\n            collection,data gathering,decision-making,drainage,economic\n            conditions,economic development,environmental\n            agencies,environmental damage,environmental\n            degradation,environmental groups,Environmental\n            Impact,Environmental Impact Assessment,environmental impact\n            assessments,environmental issues,Environmental\n            Management,Environmental Management Project,environmental\n            organizations,environmental policies,environmental\n            priorities,environmental problems,Environmental\n            Protection,Environmental Protection\n            Agency,equipment,expenditures,extension,fisheries,forest\n            management,Forestry,hazardous waste,Housing,impact\n            assessments,implementing agencies,incentive\n            systems,industrial pollution,institutional capacity,land\n            degradation,Land Resources,land use,laws,national\n            level,natural resource,natural resource management,Natural\n            Resources,NGOs,ozone,pilot projects,pollution,population\n            growth,programs,public awareness,recycling,resource\n            use,rural communities,Rural Development,socioeconomic\n            data,soil degradation,soils,technical\n            assistance,television,timber,universities,waste,waste\n            management,water contamination,Water Resources,wetlands"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 2 (AFTS2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF024310-USTDP CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF034748-GLOBAL - INST.
