Some lessons learned included: for\n            Argentina, and other countries with a federal institutional\n            framework, it is critical to take diversity in terms of\n            local institutional capacity into account and adjust the\n            project accordingly. An in-depth analysis is required to\n            identify differences in local capabilities and develop a\n            strategy on how to address the specific circumstances of\n            different provinces or localities. Results-Based Financing\n            (RBF) can work well even in a federal system, but all major\n            actors at different levels need to receive performance\n            payments, and the different sets of performance indicators\n            at different levels need to be aligned. Close engagement\n            with actors at lower levels, including health providers, can\n            make a large difference to overall performance of an RBF\n            program. A strong focus on information systems (including\n            for reporting and billing) is key for the success of a\n            larger-scale RBF program. Another reason for the better\n            performance of first phase provinces could have been that\n            they had more time to implement the project. The time frame\n            for second phase provinces was likely too short and better\n            results could have been achieved if the project period was\n            longer. If the project time frame could not be changed, then\n            it will have been better to be less ambitious with the\n            indicator targets. More broadly, provincial ownership and\n            institutional sustainability have been growing but will take\n            time to be fully entrenched."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Provincial

whose\n            main objective is \"to improve health coverage and\n            quality of care for the population without social work,\n            helping in reducing maternal and child mortality.\" The\n            Plan seeks to improve the efficiency and quality of health\n            services to achieve better results in reducing morbidity and\n            infant and maternal mortality. One of the most innovative\n            aspects of the Plan is the inclusion of an assessment of its\n            own impact on the health and welfare of the target\n            population. This assessment began with the completion, in\n            2006, of a survey on the socio-health of the target\n            population and the supply of public health services, the\n            LBAPL1 (Baseline Evaluation of the Impact of Phase 1 of the\n            Plan Nacer), covering a sample of 60 health centers by\n            province in each of the nine districts in the country that\n            make up the northeastern and northwestern regions. This\n            Final Report collects and reorganizes the information in\n            previous partial reports. The report is organized as\n            follows: Chapter 3 describes briefly the main\n            characteristics of the sample chosen for the realization of\n            the LBAPL1 and questionnaires that gave rise to the\n            databases used. Chapter 4 presents and analyzes the timely\n            filed information about socio-demographic indicators of the\n            eligible population. Chapter 5 deals specifically with\n            aspects of various kinds of risk factors which affect the\n            target population. Chapter 6 analyzes the offering of public\n            health services for birth control and infant health in the\n            designated provinces. Chapter 7 extends the analysis of data\n            collected from the integration of the information in the\n            previous chapter through hypothetical surveys and vignettes\n            to review the quality of care made.

When economic crisis struck in 2001, poverty\n            rates shot up, more than half of low-income households lost\n            their health insurance, and health outcomes deteriorated\n            sharply among the poor. The government of Argentina launched\n            Plan Nacer in 2004 as a free, voluntary, public insurance\n            program to cover uninsured mothers during pregnancy and up\n            to 45 days after delivery, as well as children under the age\n            of six. As part of the Plan Nacer reform effort, the\n            government changed the operating culture of its health\n            system to offer incentives for performance. International\n            Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) assisted with\n            the process by providing analytical support to diagnose the\n            main causes of health system inefficiencies and identify\n            options to better meet the needs of the poor. IBRD approved\n            a Provincial Maternal Child Health Sector Adjustment Loan to\n            support institutional changes that would form the foundation\n            for planned reforms. As a result, more than one million\n            previously uninsured pregnant women and children have basic\n            health insurance and secure access to services. By moving\n            from a traditional system based on inputs and fixed budgets\n            to one geared around outputs and results, Plan Nacer has\n            given beneficiaries more influence on service providers,\n            enhanced transparency, increased accountability and improved\n            public performance. IBRD continued to support Argentina in\n            its efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and\n            its own national health goals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina provee atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica a madres y ni\u00f1os"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina delivers care to\n            mothers and children : Argentina provee atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica a\n            madres y ni\u00f1os"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/03/25162262/argentina-delivers-care-mothers-children-argentina-provee-atenci\u00f3n-m\u00e9dica-madres-y-ni\u00f1os","count":"Argentina","lang":"Spanish","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"health, diseases, women, children, prevention"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Rule of law,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Human development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Argentina provee atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica a\n            madres y ni\u00f1os"}},"topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population m1327755 621,Health Management and Administration\n            m1326358 1383,Health Services Delivery m1327294 1305,Health Economics and Finance m1326577 625,Nutrition m1326779 644,Health Technologies m1327278 1331","projn":"AR-Provincial Maternal-Child Health\n            Investment Apl 2 -- P095515,AR-Provincial Maternal-Child Hlth Sector\n            Adjustment Ln.
