Some lessons\n            learned included: even during difficult political times\n            (e.g. the 2007 and 2008 transition) and periods when a\n            transition government is in place, there is a merit for the\n            Bank to maintain engagement on critical policy and\n            institutional reforms in order to ensure government's\n            continued attention on critical development issues. The Bank\n            must remain cognizant of risks associated with implementing\n            far reaching institutional reforms during the tenure of an\n            unelected government. While supporting an opportunistic use\n            of the window opened during the transition period and\n            recognizing the role of Caretaker Government (CTG) in giving\n            traction to some critical reforms, it must also be\n            acknowledged that, in Bangladesh, many challenging reforms,\n            such as privatization, deregulation and trade openness were\n            initiated and implemented under elected governments.\n            Evidence shows that these reforms although more difficult\n            and time consuming have been more sustainable. The Bank must\n            continue to maintain dialogue with the political parties,\n            including those in opposition, and with other key opinion\n            makers in a more

The transitional part of the TSC reflects the\n            transitional nature of the political situation. The TSC will\n            support a subset of the CTG's wide-ranging reform\n            agenda, which is heavily focused on tackling critical and\n            long-festering weaknesses in core governance functions.\n            Notably, the reforms have sought to strengthen and enhance\n            the autonomy of important institutions of accountability\n            such as the election commission and the anti-corruption\n            commission. Other measures have included separation of the\n            lower judiciary from the executive, preparation of the right\n            to information legislation, and formation of the regulatory\n            reforms commission to streamline business processes. The CTG\n            is also deepening economic reforms in a number of areas,\n            including trade liberalization, macroeconomic stability, and\n            strengthening public financial management and tax\n            mobilization. The recently concluded joint damage, loss and\n            needs assessment has outlined a long-term strategy that\n            integrates structural and nonstructural interventions in\n            light of the lessons learned from the natural disasters over\n            last two decades. Central to this strategy is a long term\n            disaster risk reduction framework which has five strategic\n            pillars: (a) risk identification and assessment; (b)\n            strengthening and enhancing emergency preparedness; (c)\n            institutional and community capacity building; (d) risk\n            mitigation investments; and (e) introducing catastrophe risk\n
