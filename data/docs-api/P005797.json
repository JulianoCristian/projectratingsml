The main objectives of the project\n            were: (a) to increase agricultural productivity and incomes\n            of farmers on 120,000 hectares, including those of the low\n            rainfall areas of the region by means of improved\n            agricultural services; improved utilization of land and\n            water resources; and special assistance to women farmers;\n            and (b) to improve the health and nutrition standards of the\n            rural families through improved extension services to rural\n            women. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned from the project were as follows: (a) the\n            timely availability of adequate recurrent local operational\n            budget is vital for the long-term sustainability of the\n            project; (b) effective management of complex projects\n            requires an efficient regional coordination mechanism; (c)\n            there is a need to set up and implement a pragmatic\n            mechanism to forge effective and close links between\n            extension and research activities under the concerned\n            projects; (d) the development and adoption of M and E\n            systems should build on existing practices and take into\n            account the national capacity and training needs to enable\n            local

increase\n            agricultural productivity and incomes of farmers of the\n            Southern Region by providing improved agricultural services\n            including operation and maintenance of agricultural\n            infrastructure, improved utilization of land and water\n            resources, special assistance to women farmers; and improved\n            services for rural women to raise the health and nutrition\n            standards of the rural families. The project consists of\n            construction of facilities, and the provision of vehicles\n            and equipment, the establishment and strengthening of\n            regional support services in agricultural extension, rural\n            development for women and veterinary services.  The project\n            further entails operation and maintenance; development of a\n            tree nursery; provision  of fertilizer; and construction of\n            subbranches for the Cooperative and Agricultural Credit Bank\n            (CACB).  In addition, the project aims to establish\n            demonstration farms to train farmers in irrigation and\n            agricultural practices; rehabilitate irrigation schemes (350\n
