Some lessons learned\n            included: the report made several recommendations on\n            improving operations and maintenance, including: (a) adding\n            additional criteria for review before approval of project\n            proposals, including separate items or annexes to show\n            operation, maintenance, and sustainability costs for assets;\n            (b) giving priority to and encouraging applicants who\n            conduct operations and maintenance on existing assets at an\n            appropriate quality and level; (c) evaluating the operation\n            and maintenance of assets previously improved by the ASIF in\n            the case of communities that are applying for additional\n            ASIF funding after receiving a project in the past; and (d)\n            providing enhanced training on operations and maintenance.\n            These recommendations translated into inclusion of more\n            strict requirements in the follow-up operation (SILD).
