Lessons\n            learned from the projects included: once-off grant funding\n            at the sub national level can be used to compensate\n            municipalities for the larger losses they may incur through\n            reduced fiscal transfers. As long as the cost of the grant\n            funding to the higher level government is below that of the\n            transfers it made before, the net fiscal effect of the\n            subsidy for the country or region will be positive. To\n            strengthen city management in transition economies, bringing\n            younger and innovative staff on board as well as deploying\n            experienced and traditional staff, can help form the dynamic\n            local teams and leadership needed. A city's single\n            celebratory event, with the municipal pride it engenders,\n            can be used by the Bank and Borrower as an opportunity to\n            start reform. The special occasion can also serve as a\n            pretext for exceptional grant financing, without undermining\n            medium term financial reform. In Kazan the occasion was the\n            city millennium. In other cities, it can be hosting a major\n            trade, sporting or cultural event."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Kazan Municipal\n            Development

had the following ratings: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned included: 1) Russia has\n            asked the Bank to work at the sub-national level to address\n            a diversity of local issues ranging from fiscal\n            sustainability and social protection to the housing and\n            communal services sector. The Kazan work shows that such\n            issues can be very successfully addressed through a\n            combination of a systemic approach with appropriate\n            institutional development; 2) The DPL option selected for\n            Kazan allowed focus on the substance of reforms rather than\n            on the project procurement and implementation issues that\n            tend to consume both borrower and Bank staff in an\n            investment project; 3) The Program was approved as an\n            adjustment operation without a separate technical assistance\n            component. A stand alone Technical Loan was not possible due\n            to existing borrowing limitations of the federal government;\n            4) Local consultants employed by the Bank at the project\n            preparation stage helped tremendously to focus the Program\n            on approaches that had been tested in other regions of\n            Russia. A fully local Bank team can be highly effective in\n            daily supervision dialogue with municipal authorities, yet\n            international experts can be extremely helpful, particularly\n            at the preparation stage; and 5) Joint projects with the\n            Bank and other international financial institutions increase\n            the quality of project preparation and implementation,\n            manifest an international approval of local reforms and thus\n            increase regional and municipal investment ratings."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russia -

The macroeconomic and fiscal framework has been\n            satisfactory during the Program period. The Borrower and the\n            City have fully met seven out of the nine core conditions of\n            the second tranche release, and have substantially met one\n            more condition relating to the improvements in the housing\n            and communal sector (except full elimination of\n            cross-subsidization between water users that was prevented\n            by an unexpected tariff increase caps introduced in the\n            national legislation). Implementation of one core condition,\n            i.e. transfer of the city's water and wastewater\n            facilities to a competitively selected private operator, has\n            become largely redundant as the EBRD stand alone project\n            came on board and its expected development impact is\n            believed to meet the spirit of this loan.

In view of the overall performance and progress\n            with the implementation of the Program supported by the\n            Loan, it is recommended that the Executive Directors approve\n            the proposed waiver.
