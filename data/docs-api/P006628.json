debt. The main areas covered by the\n            Government's medium-term program include: (i) measures\n            to strengthen incentives for non-copper exports; (ii) steps\n            to increase public savings and the efficiency and impact of\n            public expenditures; and (iii) measures to improve the\n            condition of banking and corporate finances. The loan will\n            finance all imports, with the exception of luxury items and\n            military goods. Complementary studies designed to improve\n            health sector management, employment generation, export\n            assistance programs, and a forestry development program will\n            be
