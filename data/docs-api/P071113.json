This type of project,\n            however, should fit and be implemented within the context of\n            an overall poverty alleviation strategy of the Government,\n            and it should include an exit strategy in order to address\n            the sustainability issue. In a CDD project, it is important\n            to have a project development objective that can be easily\n            measured and monitored, and to design a system that will\n            show trends in selected indicators. Despite shortcomings of\n            the implementing agency, a project can still be implemented\n            reasonably satisfactorily if the individual members of the\n            project management team are strongly committed and dedicated\n            to the successful implementation of the project. Timely\n            restructuring is essential to deal with design and\n            implementation problems and to ensure satisfactory project\n            implementation. The implementing agency should recruit as\n            field coordinators only those persons that actually reside\n            in the area or region, as frequent field coordinator visits\n            played a constructive role in the successful implementation\n            of sub-projects. Stakeholder ownership is critical for the\n            success of community sub-projects, and the concept of\n            'beneficiary' should include the community as a whole."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lebanon - Community Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lebanon - Community Development

Nonetheless, this\n            environmental assessment looks at potential adversity on the\n            environment, due to land terracing on slopes, deforestation,\n            adversity affecting natural habitats, and biodiversity,\n            uncontrolled use of pesticides, and herbicides, and, impacts\n            on cultural heritage sites. Mitigation measures include the\n            following. Contractors shall be responsible of maintaining\n            appropriate ditches to control drainage channel discharges,\n            and disposing construction waste, oil spills, and lubricants\n            at selected dump sites. The Archaeology Department will\n            conduct ad hoc inspections, in coordination with government\n            agencies, to prevent the risk of damage to unknown\n            archaeological sites. Communities, and municipalities alike\n            will be involved in the adequate disposal of solid wastes\n            resulting from schools rehabilitation, which prioritizes on\n            sanitary, and toilets installation. Likewise, the\n            rehabilitation of health centers will require municipal, and\n            community involvement for the adequate disposal of medical\n            wastes. The Ministries of Energy, and Agriculture,\n            contractors, and communities will be involved in monitoring\n            irrigation, and drainage water quality resulting from\n            degraded ponds, and reservoirs, clogged canals, or\n            sedimentation. Adequate design of canals will provide access\n            for weeds/sediments removal, and, an operation and\n            maintenance plan shall enforce monitoring and control of\n            agrochemical uses."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Appendices"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lebanon -

The second component\n            focuses on income enhancement by funding capacity building\n            activities to support 1) micro and small entrepreneurs and\n            nongovernmental organizations providing credit to target\n            beneficiary groups; and 2) women, youth, and disabled people\n            to provide them with demand-driven specialized skills that\n
