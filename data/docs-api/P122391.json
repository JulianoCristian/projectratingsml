Some lessons\n            learned included: the operation capitalized on the\n            heightened desired for enhancing investment coordination at\n            the metropolitan level given the flow of investments being\n            channeled into the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro\n            (RJMR) as a result of the upcoming summer olympics, the\n            soccer world cup, and the ongoing industrial restructuring\n            of the region, fueled partly by the recent discovery of oil\n            reserves. These circumstantial events play a determinant\n            role in the relevance and effectiveness of lending\n            operations. Strong institutional leadership and\n            implementation capacity were key determinants of the level\n            of achievement across the various policy areas. Strong\n            leadership from top Government of the State of Rio de\n            Janeiro (GoRJ) authorities will be required to effectively\n            align priorities within the government with the goals set\n            for the operation. Ensuring the non-reversibility of tranche\n            release conditions poses a difficult challenge. Regional\n            development interventions, require engaging with multiple\n            government agencies, the implementation experience of this\n            operation illustrates the difficulties of working with\n            agencies that present uneven levels of institutional\n            maturity, technical competency, and leadership. Metropolitan\n            development operations require working with municipal, as\n            well as federal entities and programs, and add further\n            complexity. Delays in the preparation of the Technical\n            Assistance Loan (TAL) operation resulted in the lack of\n            adequate technical support for the institutional\n            restructuring activities that were envisioned under this\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL). While the team labored to\n            secure other TA support through trust funds, including\n            South-South exchanges, the void left by the TAL operation\n            substantially hindered the overall effectiveness of this\n            DPL. The experience of this operation underlines how the\n            effectiveness of a DPL can be enhanced by a TA instrument in\n            a low institutional capacity environment. Sub-national\n            operations offer great potential for cross-fertilization and\n            economies of scale. There are often trade-offs between\n            defining a thematically consistent policy matrix and\n            maximizing the accountability of implementing agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
