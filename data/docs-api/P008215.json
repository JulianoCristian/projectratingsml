Through the many lessons drawn from the\n            project, it is primarily specified that, given the\n            country's weak capacity to design, and implement a\n            complex health reform, it would have been preferable to\n            proceed with simplified, phased reforms, complemented by\n            management, and infrastructure improvements, rather than\n            preconditioning other components, on the successful\n            implementation of the policy analysis, and pilot\n            experimentation component. This could have reduced the risk\n            of costly delays, and, permitted the phased construction of\n            a policy framework to foster further institutional\n            development. Moreover, key indicators - increased coverage,\n            quality and efficiency - to measure basic outcomes, should\n            have been agreed at appraisal time, not as it turned out,\n            during implementation, when the focus is on the project\n            progress in the short-term, and not intended for the\n            long-term implementation efficiency, and impact evaluation.\n            Similarly, other lessons offer suggestions as for the\n            preparation (and careful supervision) of policy studies; for\n            project restructuring, provided changes in government\n            policy, and priorities so require to ensure relevance, and\n            impact; for the design of training programs, to include an\n            evaluation scheme, integral to the overall training program;\n            and, for the appropriate use of the Mid Term Review, in a\n            planned, strategic manner for efficient implementation,\n            impact evaluation, and if so needed, for restructuring the\n            scope, and content of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Venezuela - Health Service Reform

services in the states of Aragua, Falcon,\n            Trujillo and Zulia. The project will help the Government to:\n            a) redefine key government health policies related to the\n            organization and financing of health services; b) promote\n            decentralization by building the capacity of the four states\n            and their respective health facilities; and c) enhance the\n            quality and efficiency of government health services by\n            rehabilitating plant and replacing basic equipment in\n            ambulatory clinics and hospitals. The project consists of\n            three components. The policy analysis and reform component\n            will support policy reform in the areas of: 1) hospital\n            autonomy; 2) rationalization of the service delivery model;\n            and 3) improved health financing. The institutional\n            development component will build capacity at the state level\n            to manage health care by providing in-service management\n            training to staff of state health directorates, district\n            health offices, hospitals and ambulatory clinics; by\n            developing systems for them to manage finances, human\n            resources, strategic planning, materials, maintenance,\n            waste, and health information; by providing computer support\n            and technical assistance. The strengthening of health\n            service delivery component will improve the quality and\n            efficiency of health services by rehabilitating ambulatory\n            clinics and

services in the states of Aragua, Falcon,\n            Trujillo and Zulia. The project will help the Government to:\n            a) redefine key government health policies related to the\n            organization and financing of health services; b) promote\n            decentralization by building the capacity of the four states\n            and their respective health facilities; and c) enhance the\n            quality and efficiency of government health services by\n            rehabilitating plant and replacing basic equipment in\n            ambulatory clinics and hospitals. The project consists of\n            three components. The policy analysis and reform component\n            will support policy reform in the areas of: 1) hospital\n            autonomy; 2) rationalization of the service delivery model;\n            and 3) improved health financing. The institutional\n            development component will build capacity at the state level\n            to manage health care by providing in-service management\n            training to staff of state health directorates, district\n            health offices, hospitals and ambulatory clinics; by\n            developing systems for them to manage finances, human\n            resources, strategic planning, materials, maintenance,\n            waste, and health information; by providing computer support\n            and technical assistance. The strengthening of health\n            service delivery component will improve the quality and\n            efficiency of health services by rehabilitating ambulatory\n            clinics and hospitals and replacing and completing basic equipment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Venezuela - Health Services Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Venezuela - Health Services\n            Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/11/722671/venezuela-health-services-reform-project","projn":"VE-Health Service Reform Project -- P008215","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Venezuela, Republica Bolivariana de","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961007072956"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Central government administration,Health","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"air,asbestos,clinics,day\n            care,deaths,Decentralization,development projects,disease\n            control,doctors,expenditures,fire prevention,health\n            care,health care services,health centers,health\n            conditions,health facilities,health financing,health\n            indicators,health plans,health policies,health policy,health\n            projects,health reform,health sector,Health Services,health\n            system,health workers,hospital autonomy,hospital\n            beds,hospital systems,hospitals,households,income,infant\n            mortality,infant mortality rate,infectious\n            diseases,information\n            needs,injuries,Iron,managers,measles,Medical\n            Equipment,mortality,nutrition,nutrition\n            policies,occupancy,occupancy\n            rates,patients,physicians,pollution,population\n            groups,poverty alleviation,private sector,public\n            health,public sector,rehabilitation,safety,service\n            delivery,Social Development,waste,waste disposal,water supply,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"air,asbestos,clinics,day\n            care,deaths,Decentralization,development projects,disease\n            control,doctors,expenditures,fire prevention,health\n            care,health care services,health centers,health\n            conditions,health facilities,health financing,health\n            indicators,health plans,health policies,health policy,health\n            projects,health reform,health sector,Health Services,health\n            system,health workers,hospital autonomy,hospital\n            beds,hospital systems,hospitals,households,income,infant\n            mortality,infant mortality rate,infectious\n            diseases,information\n            needs,injuries,Iron,managers,measles,Medical\n            Equipment,mortality,nutrition,nutrition\n            policies,occupancy,occupancy\n            rates,patients,physicians,pollution,population\n            groups,poverty alleviation,private sector,public\n            health,public sector,rehabilitation,safety,service\n            delivery,Social Development,waste,waste disposal,water supply,workers"}},"owner":"Health Sector (LCSHH)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF026081-USTDA CTF,TF023940-PORTUGUESE CTF (ICEP),TF020765-CANADIAN 'GENERAL'\n            CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF034609-VENEZUELA - HEALTH SERVICES REFORM,TF023013-PHRD-HOSPITAL MODERNIZATION PROJECT","repnb":"P6413"},"facets":{}}}
