Some lessons\n            learned include: ensuring effective linkages between\n            research-extension-farmers is not easy and continues to be\n            in need of new and innovative solutions. The need to expand\n            the focus of the research and extension service agendas\n            towards more agriculture commercialization, value chain, and\n            agribusiness related areas are fast emerging as a priority.\n            To maximize long-term impacts and effectiveness of major\n            investments currently being made into national agricultural\n            research system (NARS), there is a need for continued\n            support of ongoing institutional reforms at Bangladesh\n            Agricultural Research Council (BARC) and Agricultural\n            Research Institutes (ARIs). The implementation arrangement\n            of a complex project such as this one needs streamlining to\n            achieve greater coordination, efficiency, and\n            accountability. Before deciding on additional financing (AF)\n            to scale-up an ongoing project, Bank teams and Government\n            counterparts should make thorough and realistic assessment\n            on time and bureaucratic procedural requirements needed for\n            obtaining government approval, and also anticipate potential\n            delays and distractions that the processing of the AF
