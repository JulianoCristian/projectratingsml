All the components\n            were effectively implemented resulting in substantially\n            reducing government ownership of commercial enterprises and\n            in fiscal saving. Furthermore, the project signaled stronger\n            government commitment to enhance the role of the private\n            sector. Key lessons learned include emphasizing the need for\n            quality privatizations. The implementing agency should\n            ensure that the process is widely publicized so as to\n            attract as many competitive bidders as possible. The\n            selected buyers should be committed to returning the\n            enterprises to viability. At the same time, the buyers\n            should be capable and willing to meet their outstanding\n            obligations. Compliance can be achieved by writing default\n            clauses into the sales contracts and invoking these clauses\n            when default occurs. Because the project assumed that\n            process issues could be resolved in a shorter time and the\n            outsourcing process was oversimplified, unforeseen delays\n            occurred in implementing the divestiture program.\n            Fundamental issues like the legalities involved in\n            transferring land titles need to be addressed system-wide.\n            Combining this project with the Public Enterprise and\n            Privatization Technical Assistance Project (PEPTA) was\n            helpful as the two projects were coordinated as one\n            operation with some mutual conditionalities, which\n            effectively meant more supervision time for the PSAC\n            privatization component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Private Sector Adjustment

Government's program to promote private\n            sector growth by accelerating the pace of privatization and\n            by maintaining an appropriate macroeconomic policy\n            framework, including improved management and\n            poverty-orientation of public expenditures. The\n            privatization component, which cuts across several sectors\n            and uses private firms to implement privatization, has three\n            parts: the first, covers 46 medium sized state-owned\n            enterprises (SOEs); the second covers 64 small SOEs; and the\n            third covers 4 large and strategic SOEs, including Ghana\n            Telecom and State Insurance Corporation. Of these, the\n            Government is expected to sell or liquidate 48 small and\n            medium-sized SOEs and to offer for sale 3 large and\n            strategic SOEs including Ghana Telecom, within the program\n            period. The macroeconomic framework component, in addition\n            to ensuring fiscal and monetary discipline, seeks to\n            implement better expenditure monitoring systems in 16\n            ministries covering at least 70 percent of total\n            expenditures, a more efficient multi-year contracting system\n            in 2 ministries, and a comprehensive accounting system in 6\n            ministries. Also, expenditures on basic education, primary\n            health, and rural infrastructure will be increased in real\n            terms to improve the poor's human resources and\n            income-augmenting opportunities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Private Sector Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Private Sector Adjustment\n            Credit
