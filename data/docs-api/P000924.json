Among the lessons\n            learned, it is suggested that communities were capable of\n            demanding, and maintaining services, as well as making\n            contributions to capital costs, and operation and\n            maintenance. Most importantly, the project proved that the\n            demand-driven approach, when accompanied by adequate\n            information campaigns, outlining the technical options,\n            associated costs, and, an effective financial policy\n            implementation, lays the ground for community involvement,\n            and their commitment to sustain development. Hence, review\n            of the first year of the project, concluded that District\n            staff needed to be selected more on the basis of their\n            communication, and management skills, rather than technical\n            skills alone, and, should be selected in response to their\n            demand for participation. The project also showed the\n            importance of not only transferring decision-making, but\n            also resources, if decentralization, and local\n            accountability are to be achieved, since community, and\n            district-level contracting establishes a commercial link,\n            allowing the community to develop procurement capacity.\n            Nonetheless, donor coordination remains a challenge, since\n            the Community Water and Sanitation Agency, must continue to\n            balance each donor reporting requirements, with those of the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Community Water and Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Community Water and\n            Sanitation
