Both World Bank and borrower performance were\n            satisfactory overall. Key lessons learned relate mainly to\n            the resettlement and irrigation components. They include:\n            The need to carefully appraise proposed institutional\n            arrangements for resettlement; the treatment of land\n            acquisition; the feasibility of \"moving
