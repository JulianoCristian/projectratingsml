Regional Hydropower Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings convey a satisfactory project\n            outcome, likely sustainability, substantial institutional\n            development impacts, and satisfactory performances by the\n            Bank and Borrower. Several lessons of experience were drawn\n            from this project, some are as follows. Better technical\n            preparation, especially concerning the studies leading to\n            the construction of the power plant, the transmission lines,\n            and the dispatch center should have been foreseen in the\n            project design. Moreover, detailed designs/studies should\n            have been completed prior to the launching of the bidding\n            process (a responsibility left to the contractor who\n            produced detailed designs during contract execution). This\n            would have helped limit cost increases due to contract\n            addendums, and avoid uncontrolled cost overruns for the\n            Borrower. In addition, there is need for better financing\n            harmonization: project implementation needed better and\n            timely coordination among co-lenders on issues involving\n            procurement and processing of payments, in light of the\n            project's complex financing arrangements, which\n            undermined project execution. Furthermore, it would have\n            been useful to establish Special Accounts for the Mauritania\n            and Senegal Credits, which would have reduced work slowdown\n            due to delays in payment. Bank financing should have been\n            conditional to the successful implementation of an\n            Environmental Assessment, because delays in implementing the\n            Water Charter and the resulting Manantali Reservoir\n            Management Program threatened to damage the environment, and\n            undermine the resettlement of affected populations. Both of\n            these issues could have been negotiated prior to both plant\n            and transmission systems construction. Nonetheless, the\n            project stimulated a series of actions in the region:\n            Cooperation between Mali, Mauritania and Senegal, resulting\n            in the creation of an institutional framework, thus\n            harmonizing national planning and legal frameworks to\n            promote development, trade and labor flows. It is suggested\n            member states need to create the conditions to stimulate\n            investment (public and private)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Regional Hydropower Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal -

The lack of early\n            consultations with the affected population as of the\n            construction of the reservoir in 1988, has created a\n            negative approach on the socio-economic front. Furthermore,\n            due to flooding and water contamination, endemic diseases\n            and malnutrition have affected the population health.\n            Mitigation measures have been taken for biodiversity\n            protection, such as diverting power lines from the protected\n            zones. Nevertheless, the social problems affecting an\n            essentially rural population need to be addressed, which\n            legislation has, thus far, failed to accomplish. The\n            creation of local coordination committees with strong\n            representation rights is suggested, to establish the link\n            with national governments in order to evaluate health and\n            compensation rights, including supplementary retraining and\n            monitoring management efficiency.
