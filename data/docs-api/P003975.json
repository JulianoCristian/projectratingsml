Both the\n            Bank's and the Borrower's performance under the\n            project has generally been satisfactory.The key lessons\n            learned were as follows : (i) establishment of a central\n            Project Management Unit (PMU) could benefit overall project\n            coordination and accountability; (ii) cumbersome procurement\n            processes are a leading cause of project implementation\n            delays; (iii) action on land acquisition should be taken\n            early on during project preparation stage; (iv) the project\n            did not have any outcome or impact indicators to measure the\n            performance of State Electrcitv Corporation\u2019s (PLN) power\n            transmission system in Java; (v) the project's focus on\n            institutional development solely through a system planning\n            study can in hindsight be viewed as overly narrow; and (vi)\n            more attention should be given on accurate cost estimate."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
