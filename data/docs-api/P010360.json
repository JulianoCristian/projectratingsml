(SNGPL) Among the key lessons learned from\n            this project are: The issues involved should be thoroughly\n            examined and addressed prior to breaking new ground on\n            sector reforms to ensure sustained commitment of the\n            Government and the Borrower. Given the significant share of\n            gas sales at subsidized rates to domestic consumers who are\n            mainly from the middle class and their potential vested\n            interest, the impact of proposed reforms on existing\n            relationships and incentives for political patronage based\n            on gas connections should have been carefully assessed at\n            the outset. The expected leverage of the investment\n            component with regards to restructuring and privatization\n            was, in retrospect, overly ambitious. A tougher stance from\n            the Bank could have helped meet the project's\n            development objectives. The restructuring strategy should\n            have been more clearly defined during project preparation.\n            The project's reliance on domestic financial capital\n            markets, which lacked depth and maturity, to finance\n            privatization of Pakistan's oil and gas sector was\n            risky. Finally, making the completion of the pricing study a\n            condition of effectiveness would assure that SNGPL was\n            provided with cost covering tariffs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Sui Northern Gas Pipelines\n            Limited (SNGPL) : Corporate Restructuring and System\n            Expansion Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Sui Northern Gas\n            Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) : Corporate Restructuring and\n            System Expansion Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728327/pakistan-sui-northern-gas-pipelines-limited-sngpl-corporate-restructuring-system-expansion-project","projn":"PK-Corp.
