The performances of the Borrower and the\n            Bank are rated satisfactory. PROBIO is already serving as a\n            model for numerous other biodiversity projects in Brazil.\n            Among the key lessons which have been learned through the\n            successful implementation of the PROBIO project they are:\n            1)Strategic, and include building consensus around problems,\n            priorities, and strategies for action; incorporating\n            biodiversity into other productive sectors needs to be\n            promoted to achieve the greatest impact; partnering for\n            biodiversity conservation established between diverse actors\n            can multiply potential impact and increase sustainability;\n            mobilizing the academic community to make key contributions\n            by thinking outside the conventional, disciplines,\n            addressing challenges, and helping resolve them in\n            practical, multi-sectoral ways. 2) Informational, and\n            include carefully targeting information towards key\n            stakeholders; packaging information for all target audiences\n            - scientists, policy makers, local communities, etc. - in a\n            way that is relevant, accessible, and appealing to each;\n            disseminating targeted, applied research to stimulate policy\n            debate and generation; and bringing people involved in an\n            initiative together for information exchange, as happened\n            with subproject coordinators and in the biome workshops, to\n            generate a high degree of knowledge sharing, network\n            creation, and activity stimulations; 3) Operational,\n            including involving all relevant relevant stakeholders from\n            an early stage; being creative in developing ways to\n            leverage funds (through joint calls for proposals, etc.);\n            removing 1 to 1 cofinancing requirements for each\n            transaction to increase flexibility under difficult fiscal\n            constraints; including a high level of attention to\n            methodologies and procedures; matching the calendar year of\n            the project to the fiscal year of the country; and never\n            assuming promises which depend on third parties; and\n            4)Concern subprojects, including systematic management of\n            subprojects, providing implementing teams with a kit\n            containing manuals, procedures, and key documents; knowledge\n            exchange among subproject coordinators, and reducing

the facilitation of\n            partnerships between the public and private sectors; and\n            disseminating biodiversity information. The project will\n            include the following components: 1) biodiversity\n            assessments and dissemination, which will include a\n            biodiversity information network; 2) model biodiversity\n            sub-projects; and 3) project administration. The main\n            objective of the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund (FUNBIO)\n            Project is to provide long-term and sustainable use of\n            biological diversity in Brazil. The project will have two\n            major components: 1) strengthening and operational support\n            of FUNBIO, which will include operational costs, development\n            of a cost-recovery and fund-raising program, and special\n            studies to strengthen FUNBIO; and 2) grants program that\n            will finance FUNBIO sub-projects. The sub-projects will be\n            selected on a competitive basis according to established\n            criteria. The nature of the sub-projects will include the\n            following four broad areas: (a) biodiversity conservation;\n            (b) sustainable use of biodiversity; (c) policy analysis;\n            and (d) applied research and technology development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - National Biodiversity and Brazilian\n            Biodiversity Fund Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - National Biodiversity\n            and Brazilian Biodiversity Fund Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/03/441901/brazil-national-biodiversity-brazilian-biodiversity-fund-projects","projn":"BR-National Biodiversity Project - Probio\n            (Gef) -- P006210,BR-Brazilian Biodiversity Fund - Funbio\n            (Gef) -- P044597","subtopic":"Biodiversity,Wetlands,Natural Resources Management,Environmental Management,Energy and Environment","docty":"GEF Project Document","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101911493248"},"subsc":"Central government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1996","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absorptive\n            capacity,Agriculture,amphibians,Biodiversity,Biodiversity\n            Assessments,biodiversity conservation,biodiversity\n            monitoring,biodiversity protection,Biodiversity\n            Strategy,Biological Diversity,Biome,birds,climate,climate\n            zones,Conservation,conservation activities,conservation of\n            biological diversity,deforestation,Demonstration\n            Projects,Ecology,ecosystem,ecosystems,ecotourism,endemic\n            species,Environmental Aspects,environmental\n            management,environmental protection,environmental protection\n            agency,environmental sustainability,fauna,flora,forest\n            ecosystems,forests,Genetic Resources,Geographic\n            Information,Geographic Information Systems,GIS,GLOBAL\n            ENVIRONMENT,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY,Global Environment\n            Facility Trust Fund,global warming,habitat,habitat\n            protection,habitats,income,international Biodiversity,loss\n            of biodiversity,mammals,marine ecosystems,National\n            Biodiversity,natural ecosystems,natural resource\n            management,Natural Resources,Nature,ozone,ozone\n            layer,parks,plant species,Renewable Natural\n            Resources,Restoration,scrub,species richness,Sustainable\n            Development,sustainable use,sustainable use of\n            biodiversity,sustainable use of biological\n            diversity,variety,vascular plants,vegetation,Water Resources,wetlands,Wildlife"},"1":{"cdata!":"absorptive\n            capacity,Agriculture,amphibians,Biodiversity,Biodiversity\n            Assessments,biodiversity conservation,biodiversity\n            monitoring,biodiversity protection,Biodiversity\n            Strategy,Biological Diversity,Biome,birds,climate,climate\n            zones,Conservation,conservation activities,conservation of\n            biological diversity,deforestation,Demonstration\n            Projects,Ecology,ecosystem,ecosystems,ecotourism,endemic\n            species,Environmental Aspects,environmental\n            management,environmental protection,environmental protection\n            agency,environmental sustainability,fauna,flora,forest\n            ecosystems,forests,Genetic Resources,Geographic\n            Information,Geographic Information Systems,GIS,GLOBAL\n            ENVIRONMENT,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY,Global Environment\n            Facility Trust Fund,global warming,habitat,habitat\n            protection,habitats,income,international Biodiversity,loss\n            of biodiversity,mammals,marine ecosystems,National\n            Biodiversity,natural ecosystems,natural resource\n            management,Natural Resources,Nature,ozone,ozone\n            layer,parks,plant species,Renewable Natural\n            Resources,Restoration,scrub,species richness,Sustainable\n            Development,sustainable use,sustainable use of\n            biodiversity,sustainable use of biological\n            diversity,variety,vascular plants,vegetation,Water Resources,wetlands,Wildlife"}},"owner":"Environment (LCSEN)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF028309-GEF1-BRAZIL NATIONAL\n            BIODIVERSITY PROJECT,TF028310-GEF1-BRAZILIAN BIODIVERSITY\n            FUND PROJECT,TF028659-GET-PPA BRAZIL NAT'L\n            BIODIVERSITY PROJ.","repnb":"14523"},"facets":{}}}
